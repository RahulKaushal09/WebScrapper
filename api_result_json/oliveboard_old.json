While Ladakh's ecology might be well-known, the sentence is specifically addressing its fragility, not its general ecological awareness.</p><p>Option (c) \"considered ecologically fragile\": It is correct because it accurately replaces the incorrect phrase \"regarded as ecological delicate\" with a grammatically and contextually appropriate one. \"Fragile\" is an adjective that describes something that is easily broken, damaged, or destroyed.

The phrase \"increased use\" accurately captures the notion of greater utilization of these chemicals, which aligns with the context of the sentence.</p><p>Option (d): \"Supporting the variety\" is not an appropriate phrase in the context of chemical pesticides and fertilizers.
