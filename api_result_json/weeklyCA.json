{"result": "\n<p>Economic Policy and Public Sector Enterprises</p><h2>Budgetary Dependence of CPSEs</h2><strong>Why in News?</strong>\n<p>Concerns have emerged as Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) adjust their capital expenditure (capex) strategy, increasingly relying on budgetary support instead of self-financing or private investment. This trend raises questions about the long-term financial sustainability and autonomy of these enterprises.</p>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul>    <li>CPSEs are increasingly dependent on budgetary support, which has surged by over 150% in five years.</li>    <li>The Internal and Extra Budgetary Resources (IEBR) have significantly declined, limiting financial flexibility.</li>    <li>High government debt and policy instability are deterring private investment in CPSEs.</li></ul>\n<h3>Additional Details</h3><ul>    <li><strong>Overdependence on Budgetary Support:</strong> CPSEs are relying more on funding from the government. Budgetary support increased from Rs 2.1 lakh crore in FY20 to Rs 5.48 lakh crore in FY25 (Revised Estimate).</li>    <li><strong>Decline in IEBR:</strong> The IEBR used for financing capex has dropped from Rs 6.42 lakh crore in FY20 to Rs 3.63 lakh crore in FY23, and is estimated at Rs 3.82 lakh crore in FY25, limiting CPSEs' financial flexibility.</li>    <li><strong>Reduced Private Sector Participation:</strong> The reliance on budgetary support has discouraged private investment, as seen with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) where expected private funding fell to nil in FY23-FY24.</li>    <li><strong>Policy Concerns:</strong> The Standing Committee on Transport (FY22) emphasized that reliance on budgetary support may not meet investment needs, urging for increased private sector engagement.</li>    <li><strong>High Dividends:</strong> Government pressure on CPSEs to prioritize dividend payments over reinvestment restricts their ability to modernize and grow independently.</li>    <li><strong>Limited Financial Autonomy:</strong> CPSEs lack the flexibility to respond rapidly to market changes, which can slow down decision-making processes.</li></ul>\n<p>In summary, the financial health of CPSEs is under scrutiny due to rising debt burdens and a lack of private investment. Addressing these issues through policy reforms, encouraging independent capital raising, and balancing dividend payments with reinvestment is crucial for ensuring fiscal sustainability.</p>\n<h3>What are the Key Facts About CPSEs?</h3><ul>    <li><strong>About:</strong> CPSEs are companies in which the Central Government or other CPSEs hold at least a 51% stake.</li>    <li><strong>Department Oversight:</strong> The performance, finance, and policies of CPSEs are overseen by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE).</li>    <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Post-independence, India's socialist model led to the establishment of CPSEs in key industries, which saw a shift towards corporatization and efficiency post-1991 economic reforms.</li>    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> CPSEs are vital for India's economic development, infrastructure creation, and employment generation.</li>    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> CPSEs are classified into Miniratna, Navratna, and Maharatna based on size, financial performance, and strategic importance.</li></ul>\n<img alt=\"Classification_of_cpses\" caption=\"false\" class=\"content-img\" src=\"http://drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1741358256_Classification_of_cpses.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"650\"/>\n\n<p>As of March 2024, there are 448 CPSEs, with only 272 operating in FY24. The gross revenue of these enterprises declined by 4.7% to Rs 36.08 lakh crore in FY24. They contributed Rs 4.85 lakh crore to the central exchequer in FY 2023-24, marking a 5.96% increase from the previous year. Additionally, CPSEs spent around Rs 4,900 crore on CSR activities, reflecting a significant increase from the prior year.</p>\n<h3>What Measures Can Address CPSEs\u2019 Concerns?</h3><ul>    <li><strong>Disinvestment:</strong> The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) suggests prioritizing the privatization of non-strategic CPSEs to attract private investment.</li>    <li><strong>Raise Capital Independently:</strong> Encourage CPSEs to enhance IEBR financing through bonds and partnerships to reduce reliance on budgetary support.</li>    <li><strong>Digital Transformation:</strong> CPSEs should improve operational efficiency by adopting advanced digital infrastructures.</li>    <li><strong>Limiting High Dividend Payout:</strong> CPSEs should balance dividend payments with necessary reinvestments for growth.</li>    <li><strong>CPSE Performance Reviews:</strong> Limit performance reviews to twice a year for better efficiency.</li></ul>\n<p>In conclusion, critically evaluating the financial health of CPSEs, especially in light of their increasing debt, indicates a need for strategic reforms and measures to ensure their fiscal sustainability.</p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency Regulation</p><h2>Need for Balanced Cryptocurrency Regulation</h2><strong>Why in News?</strong>\n<p>The US administration has recognized the significance of crypto assets, firmly establishing their role in global finance.
