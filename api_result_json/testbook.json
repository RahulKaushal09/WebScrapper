Credit <strong>seldom</strong> trickles down to the worker at the bottom. The World Health Organization\u2019s act of recognizing India\u2019s ASHA (accredited social health activists) and the polio workers of Afghanistan is an attempt to right that wrong. It is a rare, and <strong>commendable</strong> doffing of the hat for workers at the very bottom of the rung, and gives credit where it is due. When WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the names of six Global Health Leader awardees at the opening session of the World Health Assembly, over one million ASHAs and eight volunteer polio workers found themselves being counted amidst people leading from the front. The other awardees are Paul Farmer, co-founder of the NGO Partners in Health, Ahmed Hankir, a British-Lebanese psychiatrist, Ludmila Sofia Oliveira Varela, a youth sports advocate, and Y\u014dhei Sasakawa, WHO\u2019s Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination. Dr. Tedros who picks the awardees himself said that the award recognizes those who have made an outstanding contribution to protecting and promoting health around the world, at a time when the world is facing an unprecedented convergence of inequity, conflict, food insecurity, climate crisis, and a pandemic.</p>\n<p>The ASHAs were honored for their \u201ccrucial role in linking the community with the health system, to ensure those living in rural poverty can access primary health care services....\u201d These workers, all women, faced harassment and violence for their work during the pandemic, well documented in the media. While the pandemic rewrote the rules, creating danger where mere routine existed, it must be stressed that in general, their job, which takes them into difficult-to-reach places and hostile communities, confers a measure of privations. Even as they contribute to better health outcomes, this workforce continues to protest across the country, for better remuneration, health benefits, and permanent posts. The eight volunteer polio workers of Afghanistan (four of them women) were shot and killed by gunmen in Takhar and Kunduz provinces in February 2022. Their work was crucial in a country where wild poliovirus type 1 is still circulating, WHO recorded. Clearly, certain kinds of basic public health work are fraught with perils on several continents across the world. It is the duty of the governmental agencies that employ them to ensure their welfare, safety, and security. While cheerleading about the award is rightfully reaching a crescendo, what matters is how the Indian government serves its last-mile health workers who are its feet on the ground, once the dust raised by their unexpected recognition has settled down.</p>\n<span style=\"\">Choose the </span><span style=\" font-weight: 700;\">antonym</span><span style=\"\"> of the word '</span><span style=\" font-weight: 700;\">Seldom</span><span style=\"\">'.</span>", "options": ["Scarcely", "Often", "Sporadically", "Infrequently", "Rarely"], "answer": "2", "solution": "<p style=\"\">The correct answer is <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">'</span><strong><span style=\"\">Often</span></strong>.<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">'</span></p>\n<p style=\"\"><span style=\"display: flex;

Credit <strong>seldom</strong> trickles down to the worker at the bottom. The World Health Organization\u2019s act of recognizing India\u2019s ASHA (accredited social health activists) and the polio workers of Afghanistan is an attempt to right that wrong. It is a rare, and <strong>commendable</strong> doffing of the hat for workers at the very bottom of the rung, and gives credit where it is due. When WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the names of six Global Health Leader awardees at the opening session of the World Health Assembly, over one million ASHAs and eight volunteer polio workers found themselves being counted amidst people leading from the front. The other awardees are Paul Farmer, co-founder of the NGO Partners in Health, Ahmed Hankir, a British-Lebanese psychiatrist, Ludmila Sofia Oliveira Varela, a youth sports advocate, and Y\u014dhei Sasakawa, WHO\u2019s Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination. Dr. Tedros who picks the awardees himself said that the award recognizes those who have made an outstanding contribution to protecting and promoting health around the world, at a time when the world is facing an unprecedented convergence of inequity, conflict, food insecurity, climate crisis, and a pandemic.</p>\n<p>The ASHAs were honored for their \u201ccrucial role in linking the community with the health system, to ensure those living in rural poverty can access primary health care services....\u201d These workers, all women, faced harassment and violence for their work during the pandemic, well documented in the media. While the pandemic rewrote the rules, creating danger where mere routine existed, it must be stressed that in general, their job, which takes them into difficult-to-reach places and hostile communities, confers a measure of privations. Even as they contribute to better health outcomes, this workforce continues to protest across the country, for better remuneration, health benefits, and permanent posts. The eight volunteer polio workers of Afghanistan (four of them women) were shot and killed by gunmen in Takhar and Kunduz provinces in February 2022. Their work was crucial in a country where wild poliovirus type 1 is still circulating, WHO recorded. Clearly, certain kinds of basic public health work are fraught with perils on several continents across the world. It is the duty of the governmental agencies that employ them to ensure their welfare, safety, and security. While cheerleading about the award is rightfully reaching a crescendo, what matters is how the Indian government serves its last-mile health workers who are its feet on the ground, once the dust raised by their unexpected recognition has settled down.</p>\n<span style=\"\">Choose the </span><span style=\" font-weight: 700;\">synonym</span><span style=\"\"> of the word '</span><span style=\" font-weight: 700;\">Commendable</span><span style=\"\">'.</span>", "options": ["Deplorable", "Discreditable", "Despicable", "Admirable", "Reprehensible"], "answer": "4", "solution": "<p style=\"\">The correct answer is <span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">'</span>\u200b<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">Admirable</span>.<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">'</span></p>\n<p style=\"\"><span style=\"display: flex;

Credit <strong>seldom</strong> trickles down to the worker at the bottom. The World Health Organization\u2019s act of recognizing India\u2019s ASHA (accredited social health activists) and the polio workers of Afghanistan is an attempt to right that wrong. It is a rare, and <strong>commendable</strong> doffing of the hat for workers at the very bottom of the rung, and gives credit where it is due. When WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the names of six Global Health Leader awardees at the opening session of the World Health Assembly, over one million ASHAs and eight volunteer polio workers found themselves being counted amidst people leading from the front. The other awardees are Paul Farmer, co-founder of the NGO Partners in Health, Ahmed Hankir, a British-Lebanese psychiatrist, Ludmila Sofia Oliveira Varela, a youth sports advocate, and Y\u014dhei Sasakawa, WHO\u2019s Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination. Dr. Tedros who picks the awardees himself said that the award recognizes those who have made an outstanding contribution to protecting and promoting health around the world, at a time when the world is facing an unprecedented convergence of inequity, conflict, food insecurity, climate crisis, and a pandemic.</p>\n<p>The ASHAs were honored for their \u201ccrucial role in linking the community with the health system, to ensure those living in rural poverty can access primary health care services....\u201d These workers, all women, faced harassment and violence for their work during the pandemic, well documented in the media. While the pandemic rewrote the rules, creating danger where mere routine existed, it must be stressed that in general, their job, which takes them into difficult-to-reach places and hostile communities, confers a measure of privations. Even as they contribute to better health outcomes, this workforce continues to protest across the country, for better remuneration, health benefits, and permanent posts. The eight volunteer polio workers of Afghanistan (four of them women) were shot and killed by gunmen in Takhar and Kunduz provinces in February 2022. Their work was crucial in a country where wild poliovirus type 1 is still circulating, WHO recorded. Clearly, certain kinds of basic public health work are fraught with perils on several continents across the world. It is the duty of the governmental agencies that employ them to ensure their welfare, safety, and security. While cheerleading about the award is rightfully reaching a crescendo, what matters is how the Indian government serves its last-mile health workers who are its feet on the ground, once the dust raised by their unexpected recognition has settled down.</p>\n<span style=\"\">According to the passage, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 700;

So Fath bought 3 dresses and Delphin bought 6 jeans.</p>\n<img src=\"https://fc.edurev.in/images/2ed02165-737d-4d94-8acf-006c6047e698.png\"/>\n<p> </p>\n<p>4. The number of Sarees bought is twice the number of shirts bought.</p>\n<p>5. Saree is bought for the second highest number. So, number of Saree is 18 and Shirt is 9.</p>\n<p>6. Gayl bought twice the number of dresses of Delphin. So, Case 1 is invalid.</p>\n<img src=\"https://fc.edurev.in/images/2337c7f2-9ed3-48cc-9c93-2723d3ea6e85.png\"/>\n<p> </p>\n<p>6.

Either Shirt or Dhoti is bought for the lowest number.</p>\n<p>As Shirt is already 9, so, the number of Dhoti bought is 3.</p>\n<img src=\"https://fc.edurev.in/images/0b64b3c7-0b99-4466-bbdc-8c054f54db47.png\"/>\n<p> </p>\n<p>8. The number of Sarees bought is twice the number of Shirts bought, which is not bought by Azim.</p>\n<p>So, he bought 15 salwar.</p>\n<img src=\"https://fc.edurev.in/images/49e2fedc-b5dc-4a5b-aa4d-e6f7a659c779.png\"/>\n<p> </p>\n<p>9.
