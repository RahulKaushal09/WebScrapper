INS ARIGHAAT
Syllabus
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
Context:
India bolstered its deterrence capability on Thursday with the commissioning of its second nuclear submarine, INS Arighaat, into the Navy.
Background: –
The discreet commissioning ceremony of the Arihant-class vessel in Visakhapatnam was attended by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
Key takeaways
INS Arighaat will join its predecessor INS Arihant strengthening the country’s nuclear triad — the ability to fire nuclear missiles from platforms in the air, land and sea.
The 6,000-tonne nuclear-propelled submarine will be armed with indigenously made K-15 missiles which have a range of over 700 km, and have undergone extensive trials over the last few months.
Like INS Arihant, it is powered by 83 MW pressurised light-water reactors which allows it to remain submerged for longer periods when compared to conventional submarines.
INS Arihant Project
The INS Arihant project was initiated over three decades ago, involving Russian assistance, private companies and the research establishment.
The lead vessel of the Arihant class, INS Arihant, was laid down in 2004, launched in 2009, and commissioned into the Navy in 2016. It was the first ballistic missile submarine built by a country outside the United Nations Security Council’s five.
Additional Information
A robust, survivable and assured retaliatory capability is in line with India’s policy to have a credible minimum deterrence capacity to underpin its ‘no first use’ commitment.
In 2003, India declared its nuclear doctrine, reserving the right of massive retaliation if it is struck with nuclear weapons.

NORTHERN BALD IBIS
After being extinct in Central Europe for 300 years, the northern bald ibis has made a comeback. Now, scientists acting as “foster parents” are guiding the birds to relearn their long-lost migration routes, leading them aboard a tiny plane.
Thirty-six of these endangered birds are now following an ultralight aircraft on a 2,800 km journey from Austria to Spain, a trip that could take up to 50 days. During the flight, human foster parents sit at the back of the microlight, waving and shouting encouragement to the birds as they fly.
About Northern Bald Ibis
The Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita), also known as the Hermit Ibis or Waldrapp, is an endangered bird species.
Description
Appearance: The Northern Bald Ibis is a large bird, measuring about 70–80 cm in length with a wingspan of 125–135 cm. It has glossy black plumage with bronze-green and violet iridescence. One of its most distinctive features is its unfeathered red face and head, along with a long, curved red bill.
Behavior: Unlike many other ibises, the Northern Bald Ibis is non-wading and prefers open areas such as grasslands, rocky mountains, and semi-deserts.
Habitat and Distribution
Historical Range: Historically, this species was widespread across the Middle East, northern Africa, and southern and central Europe.
Current Range: Today, the majority of the remaining wild population is found in southern Morocco, with smaller numbers in Syria and Turkey.
Breeding: The Northern Bald Ibis breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges, where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest.
Conservation Status
Threats: The species has faced significant threats from hunting, habitat loss, and slow reproduction rates.
Conservation Efforts: Thanks to international reintroduction programs and natural population growth in Morocco, the Northern Bald Ibis was downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2018.
Breeding efforts to increase their population over the past two decades have been successful, but without guidance from wild ancestors, the birds no longer had any knowledge of which direction to fly for winter.
Early reintroduction attempts were largely unsuccessful – instead of returning to suitable wintering grounds such as Tuscany, Italy, the birds flew in different directions and died.
To prepare them for migration, chicks were removed from their breeding colonies at Rosegg Zoo in Austria just days after hatching, taken to an aviary and looked after by a human foster parent to “imprint”. Once this happens, the birds trust the human enough to follow them along the migration route.

Prelims – ECONOMY
Reliance Industries, led by Chairman Mukesh Ambani, announced a 1:1 bonus share issue during their 47th annual general meeting.
This is the first bonus issue by Reliance Industries since 2017. The announcement has already positively impacted the company’s stock price, reflecting investor confidence.
About bonus share issue
A bonus share issue, also known as a scrip issue or capitalization issue, occurs when a company offers free additional shares to its existing shareholders.
Key Points:
Free Additional Shares: Shareholders receive extra shares without any cost.
Proportional Allocation: The number of bonus shares received is proportional to the shares already held. For example, a 1:1 bonus issue means you get one additional share for every share you own.
Increased Share Capital: The total number of shares increases, which raises the company’s share capital.
No Change in Market Capitalization: The market capitalization remains the same because the share price adjusts proportionally. If the number of shares doubles, the share price halves.
Shareholders’ Equity: The relative equity of each shareholder remains unchanged, meaning their ownership percentage in the company stays the same.
Funding: Bonus shares are typically funded from the company’s profits or reserves.
Benefits of Issuing bonus shares for the Company:
Enhanced Liquidity: By increasing the number of shares in the market, trading activity can rise, making the shares more liquid.
Positive Market Perception: Announcing a bonus issue can signal the company’s strong financial health, boosting investor confidence.
Rewarding Shareholders: It serves as a reward to loyal shareholders without impacting the company’s cash reserves.
Improved Shareholder Base: It can attract new investors who perceive the bonus issue as a sign of growth and stability.
Utilization of Reserves: It allows the company to utilize its accumulated reserves effectively.
Benefits of Issuing bonus shares for Shareholders:
Increased Shareholding: Shareholders receive additional shares without any cost, increasing their total shareholding.
No Immediate Tax Liability: Bonus shares are not taxed at the time of issuance, though capital gains tax applies upon sale.
Improved Liquidity: More shares in the market can make it easier for shareholders to buy or sell shares.
Psychological Benefit: Shareholders may feel more positive about their investment as they receive additional shares.
Proportional Ownership Maintained: The issuance of bonus shares does not dilute the ownership percentage of existing shareholders.

It is easily ignited. The vapors are lighter than air. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket.
powerful
short-lived greenhouse
gas, with a lifetime of about a decade and Global Warming Potential about 80 times greater than that of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the 20 years after it is released into the atmosphere.
Where does methane come from?
It sometimes comes from non-human sources like
wetlands
. These habitats contain things like
permafrost
, which is frozen ground that’s also filled with carbon from animals and plants that have been dead for hundreds of thousands of years.
As temperatures rise with global warming, wetland permafrost thaws. That unleashes carbon, previously locked in the ice, in the form of CO2 and methane.
Around 60% of the methane that makes it into the atmosphere comes from
human activities.

rising from the seafloor.
Most seamounts are
remnants of extinct volcanoes.
Typically, they are
cone-shaped
but often have other prominent features such as craters and linear ridges, and some, called
guyots, have large flat summits
There is a broad size distribution for seamounts, but to be classified as a seamount, the feature must have a vertical relief of at least 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) above the surrounding seafloor.
They are
found in every world ocean basin.
These are

an unpowered trajectory
that arches upwards before descending to reach its intended target.
They can carry
conventional high explosives
as well as chemical, biological, or nuclear munitions.
They can be launched from aircraft, ships, and submarines, in addition to land-based silos and mobile platforms.
There are
four general classifications
of ballistic missiles based on their range, or the maximum distance the missile can travel:
Short-range
less than 1,000 kilometers
(approximately 620 miles), also known as “tactical” ballistic missiles.
Medium-range
between 1,000 and 3,000 kilometers
(approximately 620-1,860 miles), also known as “theater” ballistic missiles.

**********RBI’s Report on the Economy’s Performance so Far in 2024-25
Why in News?
The first official gauge of the economy’s performance so far in 2024-25 has been recently released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
What’s in Today’s Article?
Highlights of the RBI’s Report
Bright Spots in India’s Economy’s Performance
Indian Economy’s Challenges and Way Ahead
Highlights of the RBI’s Report:
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth:
Earlier this month, the RBI reduced its Q1 GDP forecast from 7.2% to 7.1%.
The RBI anticipates 7.2% GDP growth through 2024–2025 after last year's 8.2% surge.
Growth in the Gross Value Added (GVA):
For the first time in a year, growth in the real GVA in the economy outperformed GDP growth, with a 6.8% uptick in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024-25.
This GVA growth in Q1 has been driven by significant growth in the Secondary Sector (8.4%), comprising construction, utility services (such as electricity, gas, water supply) and manufacturing sectors.
Employment generation:
India provisionally created 46.7 million jobs in the financial year ended March 2024, taking the country's total employment to 643.3 million.
The country's employment growth rate stood at
6%
in that fiscal year, versus 3.2% in the previous fiscal year.
Bank credit growth:
Credit to agriculture and allied activities
remained robust, registering a growth of 18.1% at Rs 21.55 lakh crore in July 2024, compared with 16.7% a year ago.
Credit growth to industry
strengthened significantly at 10.2% to Rs 37.05 lakh crore in July 2024 compared with 4.6% in July 2023.
Credit growth to services sector
moderated to 15.4% in July 2024 from 19.7% a year ago, primarily driven down by relatively lower credit growth in non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and trade segments.
Bright Spots in India’s Economy’s Performance:
Normal monsoon:
It will boost farm sector output and ease inflation, which could lift the weak rural demand and private consumption.
Private investment:
Increased demand would lessen the need for government expenditure to support growth by encouraging private firms to invest in new capacities.
Indian Economy’s Challenges and Way Ahead:
The prolonged general election
has severely hindered public capital expenditure, and the government will have to work even harder to reach its spending targets.
The policymakers need to urgently pursue meaningful reforms
across all aspects of the economy, and improve the
efficiency of its institutions and the judiciary
This is critical to lift its growth potential and fulfill hopes of creating gainful employment for its young, fast enough for India’s demographics to yield a dividend.

**********Global Fintech Fest (GFF) 2024
Why in news?
PM Modi addressed the Global Fintech Fest (GFF) 2024 at the Jio World Convention Centre in Mumbai, Maharashtra.
GFF is jointly organized by the Payments Council of India, the National Payments Corporation of India and the Fintech Convergence Council. It aims to showcase India’s strides in Fintech and bring together key stakeholders of the sector.
What’s in today’s article?
Key highlights of speech delivered by PM Modi at GFF 2024
About
Fintech, or financial technology, refers to the use of technology to deliver financial services in a more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly way.
It encompasses a broad range of innovations that aim to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services, often through digital platforms.
Applications
Digital Payments
Platforms that allow people to make payments, transfer money, and conduct financial transactions online or through mobile devices (e.g., UPI, Google Pay).
Lending and Borrowing
Online platforms that offer loans to individuals or businesses, often using data-driven algorithms to assess creditworthiness (e.g., peer-to-peer lending, digital loan apps).
Wealthtech
Platforms and tools for investment management and financial planning, including robo-advisors, online brokerage services, and digital asset management.
Blockchain and Cryptocurrency
Technologies that facilitate secure, decentralized financial transactions, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and blockchain-based financial services.
Regtech
Technologies that help financial institutions comply with regulations in an efficient and cost-effective manner, often using AI and big data.
Neobanking
Digital-only banks that offer banking services without physical branches, often through mobile apps or online platforms.
Benefits
Financial Inclusion
Through digital platforms, fintech companies have brought banking and financial services to the underserved and unbanked populations, especially in rural and remote areas.
Mobile banking, digital wallets, and micro-lending platforms have empowered millions of people, enabling them to participate in the formal economy, save money, access credit, and invest.
Job Creation and Economic Growth
The fintech sector has become a major driver of job creation in India, offering opportunities in technology, finance, marketing, and customer service.
As fintech companies grow, they contribute to the economy by generating employment and stimulating demand for various ancillary services.
Additionally, by streamlining financial processes and reducing transaction costs, fintech has improved business efficiency.
It supported the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), further boosting economic development.
Digital Payments Revolution
India’s fintech revolution is perhaps best exemplified by the widespread adoption of digital payments.
It has increased transparency, reduced corruption, and made financial transactions more secure and efficient.
Impact on Urban and Rural Divide
Fintech has helped bridge the urban-rural divide by providing equal access to financial services regardless of geographic location.
Through mobile technology, people in rural areas can access the same financial tools and resources as those in urban centers, thereby promoting economic equity and reducing regional disparities.
Concerns
Fintech Companies and Money Laundering Concerns
A Parliamentary Committee highlighted that fintech companies were being exploited by scamsters for money laundering purposes.
An example cited was the Abu Dhabi-based app called Pyppl, which was reportedly administered by Chinese investment scamsters.
This situation posed challenges for Indian law enforcement agencies in tracking the flow of illicit funds gathered through scams on the platform.
Fraud Trends and Ratio
Despite an increase in the volume of transactions over the past five years, the ratio of fraudulent transactions to total transactions has remained relatively low.
Impact on UPI Users
The percentage of UPI users affected by frauds stood at 0.0189%.
Despite concerns about fintech platforms being used for illegal activities, the overall impact on users remained relatively low compared to the total volume of transactions.
India's Fintech Revolution

Digital Transactions
: The combination of Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhaar, and mobile technology has facilitated half of the world’s digital transactions in India.
Impact of UPI
: India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has revolutionized 24/7 banking, even in rural areas.
Financial Empowerment
Women Empowerment
: Modi highlighted the role of Jan Dhan Yojana in empowering women, with over 29 crore bank accounts for women and significant benefits for rural women through self-help groups.
Mudra Yojana
: The scheme has disbursed Rs 27 trillion, benefiting 70% women, demonstrating the role of fintech in financial inclusion.
Transparency and Governance
Curbing Parallel Economy
: Fintech has introduced transparency in financial transactions, particularly through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in government schemes, reducing leakages.
Social Impact of Fintech
Urban-Rural Gap Bridging
: Fintech has transformed access to financial services, enabling farmers, fishermen, and middle-class families to manage their finances through mobile phones.
Democratization of Financial Services
: Fintech has made credit, investments, and insurance more accessible, benefiting even small vendors through schemes like PM SVANidhi.
Advancements in Digital Banking
Neobanking and Digital Only Banks
: Modi discussed modern concepts like neobanking and the shift from currency to QR codes, highlighting innovations such as Digital Twins technology and Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC).
Account Aggregators and e-RUPI

**********Tamil Nadu to nationalise Karunanidhi's work
Why in news?
The Tamil Nadu government has announced that the collected works of former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi would be "nationalised" — making them freely available for the public to publish, translate and adapt.
What’s in today’s article?
Key features of Copyright Act, 1957
Copyright laws and Nationalisation of copyright
Case of Ambedkar's works
Background – about Copyright
Copyright is an intellectual property right that protects the expression of original works such as literature, music, art, films, and sound recordings under Indian law, specifically
Section 13 of the Copyright Act, 1957
Rather than safeguarding ideas themselves, copyright law protects the specific manifestation of those ideas, like books or computer programs.
Under Section 14 of the Act
, copyright grants a set of exclusive rights to the owner, including the rights to adapt, reproduce, publish, translate, and communicate the work to the public.
These rights can only be exercised by the copyright owner or someone authorized by them.
While copyright registration records the work in the Copyright Register, it does not create the rights themselves.
Exclusive Rights
The Act grants creators of original literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, perform, translate, and adapt their works.
Duration of Protection
Copyright protection lasts for the lifetime of the author plus 60 years after their death. (literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic works)
For works like photographs, sound recordings, and films, the duration is 60 years from the year of publication.
Assignment of Rights
Section 18 of the Act allows the copyright owner to assign their rights, either wholly or partially, to another party in exchange for compensation.
This allows the owner to transfer rights for a specific period, territory, or purpose.
Public Domain
After the copyright term expires, the work enters the public domain, making it freely available for use without the need for permission.
Moral Rights
The Act also recognizes the author's moral rights, which include the right to claim authorship of the work and the right to object to any distortion, mutilation, or modification of the work that could harm the author's reputation.
Infringement and Remedies
The Act provides remedies for copyright infringement, including civil remedies like injunctions and damages, as well as criminal penalties like fines and imprisonment for serious violations.
Fair Use Doctrine
Certain uses of copyrighted material, such as for criticism, review, research, or education, are considered "fair use" and do not require permission from the copyright owner.
Compulsory Licensing
In certain cases, the Act allows for compulsory licensing, where the government can permit the use of a copyrighted work without the owner's consent, typically for public interest purposes.
Under the Copyright Act, 1957, an author is granted several legal rights, including the ability to reproduce, issue copies, perform, adapt, or translate their work.
After the author's death, these rights are passed on to their legal heirs.
Nationalisation of copyright in Tamilnadu
In 2001, the Tamil Nadu government created the Tamil Virtual Academy (TVA) to offer online education in the Tamil language.
The TVA works with the legal heirs of original copyright owners to transfer the rights of specific works to the government.
These nationalized works are then placed in the public domain and made available on the TVA's free commons website, allowing anyone to copy, modify, distribute, and use the works for commercial purposes without needing permission.
To date, the Tamil Nadu government has nationalized the works of 179 Tamil scholars and paid a total of Rs 14.42 crore in royalties to their legal heirs.
Prakash Ambedkar, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar's grandson, granted the copyright for Dr. Ambedkar's works to the Maharashtra government in the 1960s.
The state government then established a committee in 1976, which published the first volume of Dr. Ambedkar's works in 1979 as part of a 22-volume series.
In 2016, Prakash Ambedkar transferred the copyright to the Nagpur-based Symbiosis Centre, which now holds the rights to most of Dr. Ambedkar's works and manages their translation and digitization.
These works are available both in print and online. The Maharashtra government retains rights to a few books, which are distributed through specific institutions in Pune.
In 2018, the Maharashtra government requested the removal of Dr. Ambedkar's works from the Centre, triggering the grant of copyright.
