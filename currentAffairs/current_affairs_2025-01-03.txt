FRONT-RUNNING
Prelims – ECONOMY
The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has unearthed a front-running scam in the securities market and debarred 22 entities, including stock brokers, for alleged involvement and impounded ₹66 crore as ‘wrongful gains.’
SEBI’s Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Regulations (PFUTP) explicitly bans front-running.
Key takeaways
Front-running refers to the unethical or illegal practice where a broker, trader, or individual with insider access executes trades based on advance knowledge of pending large orders from clients or institutions that could influence market prices.
The objective is to profit from anticipated price movements before the larger trade impacts the market.
How Front-Running Works
Step 1: Advance Information (non-public information) : A broker or trader becomes aware of a large buy or sell order from a client or institutional investor.
Step 2: Personal Trade Execution: Before executing the client’s order, the broker/trader places their own trade to benefit from the expected price movement. The large order impacts the market, and the broker/trader profits by selling or buying at a favorable price.

WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX (WPI) AND PRODUCER PRICE INDEX (PPI)
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
The Centre announced the formation of an expert panel to revise the constituents of the country’s Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in light of the structural changes in the economy that have occurred between 2011-12, the current base year for the critical price gauge, and 2022-23 that would be the new base year.
The panel would also examine the composition of, and the methodology for compilation of a new Producers’ Price Index or PPI  and, more importantly, recommend a roadmap for India to switch over from using WPI to the PPI.
The group has been asked to submit its final report to the Office of the Economic Adviser in the Commerce and Industry Ministry within 18 months, effectively giving it a June 30, 2026 deadline.
Reasons for the setbacks in summits
Wholesale Price Index (WPI) is a measure of the average change in the prices of goods at the wholesale level, before they reach the retail market. It is one of the key indicators to track inflation in the economy.
Components of WPI in India
Categories of Goods:
Primary Articles (22.6% weight): Includes food articles, non-food articles, and minerals.
Fuel and Power (13.2% weight): Includes items like coal, electricity, and mineral oils.
Manufactured Products (64.2% weight): Includes various industrial goods such as textiles, chemicals, and machinery.
Base Year: The current base year for WPI in India is 2011–12.
Frequency of Data: WPI data is released monthly by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
Limitations of WPI
Excludes Services: WPI does not account for the price changes in the service sector, which constitutes a significant part of India’s GDP.
Retail Prices Missing: It measures prices at the wholesale level, not reflecting the actual burden on end consumers.
Outdated Composition: The current WPI composition and weights do not fully represent India’s modern economic structure.
Volatility in Primary Articles: Prices of primary articles, especially food, are subject to high seasonal volatility, skewing the index.
Producer Price Index (PPI): An Alternative
Producer Price Index (PPI) is a more comprehensive measure of inflation that tracks the average change in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their goods and services.
Advantages of PPI Over WPI
Covers Services: Unlike WPI, PPI includes the service sector, offering a holistic view of inflation.
Reflects Supply-Side Dynamics: Tracks price changes throughout the production process, from raw materials to finished goods.
International Best Practices: Most advanced economies like the US, UK, and the EU use PPI as a standard measure of inflation.
Better Policy Insights: Provides insights into the supply chain, helping policymakers address inflationary pressures at their source.

DI-AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE (DAP)
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
The Union Cabinet extended the one-time special subsidy on fertilizer Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) at a rate of ₹3,500 per metric tonne till from January 1, 2025 till further orders.
The extension is aimed at maintaining price stability and addressing the challenges posed by global market fluctuations and geopolitical tensions.
Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) is a widely utilized fertilizer in India, second only to urea in popularity. It provides essential nutrients— nitrogen (N) and phosphorus—crucial for plant growth.
It’s highly soluble and thus dissolves quickly in soil to release plant-available phosphate and ammonium.
In the financial year 2023, India produced approximately 4.3 million metric tons of DAP. Despite domestic production, India also imports DAP to meet the high demand from the agricultural sector.
DAP has additional uses, including:
As a fire retardant. For example, a mixture of DAP and other ingredients can be spread in advance of a fire to prevent a forest from burning. It then becomes a nutrient source after the danger of fire has passed.
In various industrial processes, such as metal finishing
An addition to wine to sustain yeast fermentation

SPORTS AWARDS
Double Olympic medallist Manu Bhaker has been chosen for the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award along with World chess champion D. Gukesh, men’s hockey captain Harmanpreet Singh and Paralympic gold medallist Praveen Kumar. The government has listed 32 athletes for the Arjuna Award, with 16 of them being Paralympians.
Manu’s initial exclusion from the award list, attributed to the lack of self-application under the government’s revised process, sparked controversy. With the Union Sports Minister having the final say, it was not a surprise to find Manu’s name being added to the list. This mirrors a past precedent where Saina Nehwal was granted the Khel Ratna without any application.
Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna was instituted in the year 1991–1992. It was formerly known as the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award and is the highest sporting honour of India.
The first recipient of the award was chess Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand, who was honoured for the performance in the year 1991–1992. In 2001, sport shooter Abhinav Bindra, then aged 18, became the youngest recipient of the award.
The award is given for the spectacular and most outstanding performance in the field of sports by a sportsperson over the period of the previous four years. The award comprises “a medallion, a certificate, and a cash prize of ₹25 lakh.

**********The Debate on Cash Transfers: Freebies or Greater State Investment in Reforms
Context
Cash transfers have long been part of social protection schemes across the globe
, designed to address specific challenges like poverty, health access, and education.
India’s National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), one of the oldest cash transfer initiatives, exemplifies this by providing pensions
to vulnerable populations such as the elderly, widowed, and disabled.
However,
recent trends reveal that cash transfers have evolved from targeted safety nets to political tools
used as a panacea for a wide array of social and economic challenges.
While they have gained popularity among political parties,
their efficacy in addressing underlying issues remains questionable.
The Rise of Cash Transfers in Indian Politics
In recent years,
cash transfer schemes have become a favoured strategy for political parties to secure electoral success.
For instance
, incumbent governments in Maharashtra and Jharkhand successfully utilised cash transfer schemes targeted at women voters
, contributing significantly to their re-election.
Similarly,
states like Telangana and Odisha adopted cash transfers to address agrarian distress
, a model later expanded by the central government through the PM-KISAN scheme in 2019.
These schemes have since been extended to tackle unemployment
, with several states implementing or promising direct financial assistance for the unemployed.
appeal of cash transfers lies in their simplicity and immediacy.
With the expansion of financial inclusion,
these schemes are easy to implement and provide direct, tangible benefits to voters
, bypassing bureaucratic inefficiencies and middlemen.
Additionally,
their fungible and unconditional nature makes them highly attractive to beneficiaries.
For politicians,
they offer a direct connection with the electorate
, enhancing their popularity and electoral prospects.
Arguments Against the Cash Transfer Policy: The Problematic Assumptions
Cash Transfers Solve Root Problems
A prevalent belief is that direct financial assistance can
effectively resolve issues like poverty, unemployment, and agrarian distress.
this assumption overlooks the multi-dimensional nature of these problems.
Poverty, for instance, is influenced by factors such as lack of education, inadequate healthcare,
and limited access to infrastructure.
agrarian distress arises from systemic challenges
, including outdated farming techniques, volatile markets, and inadequate policy support.
Cash transfers provide temporary relief
but fail to address the structural issues underlying these crises.
Universality Equals Effectiveness
Another flawed assumption is that
cash transfers, being fungible and universal, inherently meet the diverse needs of beneficiaries.
While their unconditional nature provides flexibility
, it also limits their capacity to address specific issues effectively.
For example,
a farmer receiving cash under an agrarian distress scheme might use it for immediate household expenses rather than investing in agricultural inputs
or modern equipment.
unemployed youth might use funds for consumption rather than skill development or entrepreneurship.
The u
niversal application of cash transfers disregards the varied and nuanced needs of different demographic groups.
Cash Transfers Bypass Bureaucratic Inefficiencies
While cash transfers do circumvent some layers of bureaucracy
and reduce the role of intermediaries, they are not immune to implementation challenges.
Issues such as exclusion errors, where eligible beneficiaries are left out
, and inclusion errors,
where ineligible individuals receive benefits, are common.
These errors
undermine the fairness and effectiveness of such schemes.
the dependence on robust financial infrastructure and digital literacy excludes marginalised populations
, particularly in rural areas where access to banking services remains limited.
Political Success Equals Policy Success
Perhaps the
most problematic assumption is the conflation of political and policy success.
electoral gains achieved through cash transfers are often seen as evidence
of their effectiveness.
this ignores the broader metrics of success
, such as improvements in human development indicators, economic growth, or social equity.
Political parties focus on the immediate popularity boost
from cash transfers
without evaluating their long-term impact or sustainability.
Arguments Supporting the Cash Transfer Policy
Empowering Women Through Direct Transfers
India’s performance in global indices of gender equality reveals a stark reality.
Ranked 129 out of 146 countries in the 2023 Global Gender Gap report, India has seen a declining trend in women’s workforce participation despite robust economic growth.
Direct cash transfers to women have shown promise in dismantling barriers to education
, employment, and dignified living.
For instance,
the Delhi government’s 2019 initiative of free bus rides for women resulted in a 24% increase in employment among women
from marginalized communities, as reported in a 2023 independent study.
This
program illustrates how targeted subsidies can empower women by providing affordable mobility
, a critical factor in accessing work and education.
Broader Impact on Society
Over the last decade,
the Delhi government has introduced multiple subsidies, such as free electricity and water,
aimed at enhancing the quality of life for lower- and middle-income groups.
These measures not only act as social safety nets but also stimulate economic demand
by boosting purchasing power.
Contrary to fears of misuse
, global evidence suggests that beneficiaries of cash transfers prioritise essential expenses such as nutrition, education, and healthcare.
A study across 119 developing countries found recipients of unconditional cash assistance programs improved their quality of life significantly
, underscoring the utility of such schemes in addressing poverty and inequality.
Balancing Welfare with Development
concern that welfare schemes might divert resources
from critical investments in infrastructure and human capital is
valid but context-dependent
Delhi Model provides an instructive case
. Approximately 40% of its annual budget is allocated to health and education, leading to significant improvements in these sectors.
Delhi now boasts some of the best government schools
and public healthcare systems in India.
Simultaneously, the state has made significant strides in infrastructure development
, from doubling the Delhi Metro’s length to expanding green mobility through e-buses.
These achievements demonstrate that welfare schemes and developmental investments can coexist,
provided there is prudent fiscal management.
Way Forward: Rethinking the Assumptions
problematic assumptions
underpinning the over-reliance on cash transfers
highlight the need for a paradigm shift in policy design.
Cash transfers should be viewed as one component of a broader strategy
, complementing investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social services.
Policymakers must recognise that sustainable solutions require time, effort, and collaboration
across stakeholders.
Without addressing these flawed assumptions, cash transfers risk becoming a superficial fix
rather than a transformative tool for development.
Conclusion
While cash transfers have their merits,
their overuse as a political tool risks undermining the very objectives they aim to achieve.
The need of the hour is a more balanced understanding
of the role of cash transfers in social welfare.
Rather than being viewed as quick-fix solutions,
they should be integrated into broader strategies aimed at strengthening social safety nets and addressing systemic issues.
This requires prioritising investments in critical sectors and designing interventions that go beyond electoral gains
to achieve sustainable development outcomes.

**********Brazilian Velvet Ant
Scientists found that the dark markings on Brazilian Velvet Ant species of fluffy wasp reflected less than 1 percent of light.
About Brazilian Velvet Ant:
Velvet ants are a
group of parasitic wasps
that are well known for a suite of defensive adaptations including bright coloration and a formidable sting.
Appearance:
They are wasps, some of which are wingless, and are named in part for their exteriors. Velvet ant is known for its distinct
black and white markings.
Habitat:
It is found in
shrub desert in Brazil
called the Caatinga.
Characteristics:
It demonstrates remarkable mobility and covers significant distances in pursuit of hosts on the ground.
It is usually
found throughout the day
, peak activity typically coincides with the early morning and late afternoon, during periods of subdued sunlight.
It is recently found that the black parts on
female velvet ants
were actually ultrablack   so that they absorbed nearly all visible light.
Why this finding is Unique?
Ultrablack pigmentation is rare in the animal kingdom.
In organisms that have it, it helps them
hide from predators
, regulate body temperature or even attract mates, as the contrast against brighter colors can be visually enticing.

**********Melatonin
Scientists have proved that nano-formulation of Melatonin showed improved antioxidative and neuroprotective properties and could be a potential therapeutic solution for Parkinson's disease (PD).
About Melatonin:
It is a
neurohormone
secreted from the
pineal gland
of the brain in response to darkness.
It is related to the timing and quality of our sleep and wake rhythms and determined by our
internal body clock.
It makes us sleepy at certain times of the day. It starts to secrete when our bodies are getting ready to go to sleep and usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes to take full effect.
Melatonin secretion is at
its highest in the middle of the night
and gradually starts to decrease until we are ready to wake up and start our day.
Key facts about Parkinson's disease:
progressive neurological disorder
that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves.
It is a condition in which a patient has limited or no control over his movements and body balance.
The risk of developing Parkinson’s disease naturally increases with age, and the average age at which it starts is 60 years old.
Many studies have suggested that
men are more likely to be affected
by Parkinson’s than women.
Cause:
It is caused by the
degeneration of nerve cells
in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra, which controls movement.
These nerve cells die or become impaired, losing the ability to produce an important chemical called dopamine.
Dopamine operates with other neurotransmitters to help coordinate the millions of nerve and muscle cells involved in the movement.
Lack of dopamine causes the slowed movements and tremors symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Treatment:
There's no cure for this disease, but treatments can help significantly improve your symptoms.

in an “incinerator
,” which is a
type of furnace
designed for burning hazardous materials in a combustion chamber.
Many different types of
can be treated by incineration,
including soil, sludge, liquids, and gases.
Although it destroys many kinds of harmful chemicals, such as solvents, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), and pesticides, incineration
does not destroy metals such as lead and chromium.
Waste incineration
can be a form of waste-to-energy
because the heat generated during combustion can be used to create electricity.
How Does It Work?
Hazardous materials must be
excavated or pumped into containers
before incineration.
They may require further preparation, such as
grinding or removing large rocks and debris
, or removing excess water.
are then
placed in the combustion chamber
of an incinerator where they are
heated to an extremely high temperature
for a specified period of time.
The temperature and length of time depend on the types of wastes and contaminants present.
Air or pure oxygen
may be added
to the chamber to supply the oxygen needed
for burning.
As the wastes heat up, the
contaminants volatilize
(change into gases), and
most are destroyed.
Gases
that are
not destroyed pass through a secondary combustion chamber
for further heating and destruction.
resulting gases then pass through air pollution control equipment,
which removes particulate matter (extremely small particles or liquid droplets) and “acid gases.”

**********Winter Char Dham
Why in news?
The Uttarakhand government on December 8 inaugurated the winter Char Dham circuit, aimed at drawing tourists to the state in the off-season winter months.
What’s in today’s article?
Char Dham: Sacred Shrines of the Garhwal Himalayas
Char Dham All Weather Highway Development Project
Promoting Winter Char Dham Tourism
Various Concerns
Recommendations and Actions
The Revered Char Dham Shrines
Located in Uttarakhand’s Garhwal Himalayas, the Char Dham comprises
Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath
These shrines attract lakhs of pilgrims annually from May to November, contributing significantly to the state’s economy.
Winter Inaccessibility and Alternate Seats
Heavy snowfall during winter makes the shrines inaccessible, leading to their seasonal closure.
Deities are relocated to lower-altitude winter seats:
Gangotri:
Mukhba, Uttarkashi
Yamunotri:
Kharsali, Uttarkashi
Kedarnath:
Omkareshwar Temple, Ukhimath, Rudraprayag
Badrinath:
Pandukeshwar, Chamoli
It is a highway expansion project to widen 889 km of hill roads to provide all-weather connectivity in the Char Dham circuit.
The project, envisaged in 2016, covers Uttarakhand’s four major shrines — Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri — in the upper Himalayas.
Off-season tourism
Winter Char Dham attracts pilgrims during the off-season to boost tourism.
As of December 30, 15,314 pilgrims visited the winter shrines, with Omkareshwar Temple receiving the highest footfall (6,482), followed by Pandukeshwar (5,104), Mukhba (3,114), and Kharsali (614).
Changing Uttarakhand’s Image
Beyond a Summer Destination
The winter Char Dham aims to position Uttarakhand as a year-round destination.
Tourists are encouraged to explore lesser-known spots near the winter abodes of the Char Dham shrines.
‘Sun Tourism’ Initiative
Leveraging clear skies and fresh air during North India’s smog-filled winters, the state seeks to attract visitors.
The initiative is expected to boost the state’s economy and reinvigorate tourism in the off-season.
Economic Significance of Char Dham
The Char Dham generates over Rs 200 crore daily for Uttarakhand’s economy during the pilgrimage season.
Winter tourism is yet to see substantial growth, but officials are optimistic about increased footfall as the season progresses.
Impact of Overcrowding and Commercialisation
Unchecked increase in pilgrimage numbers leads to overcrowding, environmental degradation, and the commercialisation of sacred sites.
Strain on local infrastructure and fragile ecosystems disrupts the sanctity of holy places.
Winter Wildlife Disturbance
Winter traffic affects rare and threatened wildlife like snow leopards and mountain sheep, as they descend to lower altitudes for food and water.
Shy animals face disruptions due to human presence in sensitive areas.
Harsh Terrain and Weather Risks
Safety, security, and public health are key concerns for pilgrims during harsh winter conditions in Uttarakhand’s mountainous regions.
Sustainable Yatra Management
A sustainable approach is needed to balance pilgrimage with environmental preservation.
Proper management can mitigate the negative impacts of increased footfall.
Carrying Capacity Assessment
The National Green Tribunal instructed the state to ascertain the Char Dham’s carrying capacity.
The Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board has engaged the Wildlife Institute of India to study and report on this within a year.

**********How in-flight Internet works
Why in news?
Air India has become the first Indian airline to offer Wi-Fi internet connectivity on select domestic and international flights. Initially, the service will be free on select domestic flights during a limited introductory period, with plans to expand to other aircraft in the fleet.
What’s in today’s article?
Air India Expands Wi-Fi Services to Domestic Flights
Technologies Behind In-Flight Connectivity
How In-Flight Wi-Fi Works?
Costs and Challenges of Installing In-Flight Wi-Fi
Air India will now offer Wi-Fi connectivity on its Airbus A350, Boeing 787-9, and select Airbus A321neo aircraft.
These aircraft, including those inherited from Vistara after their merger in November 2024, are equipped with the necessary hardware to provide onboard internet.
Previously, Vistara offered this service on select international flights via Nelco and Panasonic Avionics Corporation, a collaboration now extended to Air India’s domestic flights.
Passengers can access Wi-Fi by enabling it on their devices, connecting to the 'Air India Wi-Fi' network, and entering their PNR and last name on the redirected portal.
This rollout, initially part of a pilot program on international flights, represents a significant step in Air India's ambition to enhance passenger experience and align with global standards.
Ground-Based Cellular Towers (Air-to-Ground Technology)
Utilizes antennae, typically mounted on the aircraft’s belly, to connect with nearby ground towers.
Functions similarly to how devices access wireless internet on the ground.
Offers stable connectivity unless the aircraft flies over large water bodies, deserted land, or areas with sparse cellular towers.
Limited by the availability of ground towers.
Satellite-Based Connectivity
Internet is transmitted from ground stations to aircraft via satellites, using antennae on top of the aircraft.
Provides broader coverage, especially over regions without ground towers, such as oceans or remote areas.
Increasingly popular due to its wider and more reliable coverage.
Signal Transmission Inside the Aircraft
Passengers’ devices connect to multiple Wi-Fi antennae located in the cabin.
Signals are sent from these antennae to an onboard server.
This process is common for both ATG and satellite-based systems.
Satellite-Based Connectivity Process
Signals from the onboard server are transmitted via an antenna on top of the aircraft to a satellite.
The satellite relays the signals to a ground station/teleport.
Response signals follow the reverse path back to the aircraft through the satellite.
Air-to-Ground (ATG) Connectivity Process
Signals from the onboard server are directly sent to ground cellular towers using an antenna beneath the aircraft.
Towers respond by transmitting signals back to the aircraft.
Speed Limitations and Future Developments
In-flight Wi-Fi is slower than ground internet, but advancements in technology are gradually improving its speed and reliability.
Equipment Installation Costs
Airlines face high initial costs to install antennae on aircraft.
Retrofitting older planes can disrupt operations, making installation on new aircraft more practical.
Air India's $400-million retrofit programme presents an opportunity to equip older planes with Wi-Fi as part of the overhaul.
Existing Wi-Fi-Enabled Aircraft
Air India’s current Wi-Fi-enabled planes are newer models, already equipped with the necessary hardware, unlike its older legacy fleet.
Global Practices for Onboard Wi-Fi
Many airlines offer a small volume of free Wi-Fi before charging customers for data packs, which are often expensive.
Some provide free or unlimited Wi-Fi to loyalty programme members, as well as business and first-class passengers.
Air India’s Current Approach
Air India is offering free Wi-Fi for a limited introductory period but has not disclosed when charges will apply.
Future Revenue Potential
Growing demand for in-flight Internet positions it as a lucrative ancillary revenue stream.
Complimentary Wi-Fi for economy class passengers is unlikely to become a widespread practice in the near to medium term due to high installation costs.

**********Wholesale Price Index
Why in News?
The Central government has announced the formation of an expert panel to revise the constituents of the country’s Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Inflation (Meaning, How it is calculated)
About (WPI, Meaning, How it is calculated, Components, Difference from CPI, etc.)
News Summary
What is Inflation?
Inflation is basically the
general rise in the price of goods and services and the decline in purchasing power of people
This means that
when inflation rises (without an equivalent rise in your income), one is able to buy lesser things than previously, or one has to pay more money for the same stuff now
A “rising” inflation rate implies that the rate (at which the prices rise) itself is increasing.
In other words, imagine a scenario where the inflation rate was 1% in March, 2% in April and then 4% in May and 7% in June.
What is Wholesale Price Index?
Wholesale Price Index, or WPI, measures the
changes in the prices of goods sold and traded in bulk
by wholesale businesses to other businesses.
Wholesale market is only for goods
, one cannot buy services on a wholesale basis.
It is used to track the supply and demand dynamics in industry, manufacturing and construction.
The index is released by the
Economic Advisor in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
every month.
The quantum of rise in the WPI month-after-month is used to measure the level of wholesale inflation in the economy.
How is WPI calculated?
The index is based on the
wholesale prices of number of relevant commodities
The commodities are chosen based on their significance in the region.
These represent different strata of the economy and are expected to provide a comprehensive WPI value.
Number of commodities:
697 items
Base year:
2011-12
Major Components of WPI:
‘Primary articles’
(22.62%) is a major component of WPI, further subdivided into Food Articles and Non-Food Articles:
Cereals, Paddy, Wheat, Pulses, Vegetables, Fruits, Milk, Eggs, Meat & Fish, etc.
Oil Seeds, Minerals and Crude Petroleum.
The next major basket in WPI is
Fuel & Power
(13.15%), which tracks price movements in Petrol, Diesel and LPG.
The biggest basket is
Manufactured Goods
(64.23%). It spans across a variety of manufactured products such as Textiles, Apparels, Paper, Chemicals, Plastic, Cement, Metals, and more.
Manufactured Goods basket also includes manufactured food products such as Sugar, Tobacco Products, Vegetable and Animal Oils, and Fats.
What are Headline and Core Inflation?
Headline inflation refers to the change in value of all goods in the basket.
Core inflation excludes food and fuel items
from headline inflation.
Since the prices of fuel and food items tend to fluctuate and create ‘noise’ in inflation computation,
core inflation is less volatile than headline inflation
Headline inflation is more relevant for developing countries like India where fuel and food items account for 30-40% of the basket.
What is the Major Difference Between WPI and CPI?
While WPI keeps track of the wholesale price of goods, the CPI (Consumer Price Index) measures the average price that households pay for a
basket of different goods and services
Why Reserve Bank of India Adopted CPI over WPI?
On the recommendation of the
Urjit Patel Committee (2014)
RBI adopted CPI as the key measure of inflation
. Earlier, RBI had given more weightage to WPI as the key measure of inflation for all policy purposes.
CPI focuses on the change in the cost of living at the consumer’s end
, whereas the WPI focuses on the inflation of the economy as a whole.
For common people, i.e. consumers, it is the CPI that is more relevant than the WPI. CPI also covers the service sector.
Through CPI, the RBI can increase the span of monetary control and monitor inflation better.
Therefore, the RBI linked CPI for fixing interest rates in India.
News Summary:
The Union Government has announced the formation of an
18-member expert panel
and consider transitioning to a
Producers' Price Index (PPI)
This move reflects the structural changes in India’s economy since the WPI's current base year of
, with a
new base year proposed as
2022-23
The working group will be led by
Ramesh Chand
, a member of NITI Aayog.
Members include officials from various ministries (Statistics, Finance, Petroleum, and Agriculture), representatives from the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
, and private sector economists.
The panel has been tasked to submit its final report by
June 30, 2026
, to the
Office of the Economic Adviser
in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
Key Objectives
Enhance the reliability of indices to better reflect economic changes.
Address statistical and computational challenges in transitioning to PPI.
Significance of the Move:
This initiative marks a significant step in aligning India’s price measurement tools with global standards.
The shift from WPI to PPI aims to offer a more comprehensive reflection of price trends at the producer level, aiding policymakers and industries alike in economic planning.

**********Genetically Modified Crops
Why in the News?
The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has amended the rules governing the selection of experts to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC).
What’s in Today’s Article?
About GM Crops (Meaning, Benefits, Concerns, etc.)
Regulations in India (Laws/Bodies Related to GM Crops)
News Summary
About Genetically Modified (GM) Crops:
Genetically Modified (GM) crops are plants whose DNA has been altered through genetic engineering techniques to introduce desirable traits.
These traits may include resistance to pests, diseases, or environmental conditions, improved nutritional content, or increased yield.
Unlike traditional crossbreeding methods, genetic modification allows for the direct manipulation of a plant’s genetic material, often incorporating genes from different species to achieve specific results.
Benefits of GM Crops:
Increased Yield:
GM crops can produce higher yields, contributing to food security.
Pest and Disease Resistance:
Crops can be engineered to be resistant to specific pests and diseases, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.
Herbicide Tolerance:
Some GM crops are designed to withstand certain herbicides, making weed control more effective.
Enhanced Nutritional Content:
Crops can be modified to contain higher levels of essential nutrients, addressing malnutrition in developing countries.
Environmental Benefits:
Reduced need for chemical inputs can lower the environmental impact of agriculture.
Concerns / Controversies w.r.t. GM Crops:
Environmental Impact:
There is ongoing debate about the potential for GM crops to affect non-target species and lead to a reduction in biodiversity.
Health Concerns:
While extensive research indicates that GM foods are safe to eat, public concern about potential long-term health effects persists.
Economic Issues:
GM seeds are often patented, leading to concerns about corporate control over the food supply and the economic impact on small-scale farmers.
Ethical and Labeling Issues:
There are ethical debates surrounding the manipulation of genetic material, and many advocate for clear labeling of GM products to inform consumer choice.
Regulations w.r.t. GM Crops in India:
The adoption and regulation of GM crops vary globally. In some countries, GM crops are widely grown and consumed, while others have stringent regulations or outright bans.
In India, the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change oversees all activities, operations, and products associated with genetically modified organisms.
These are regulated under the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
(GEAC), part of MoEFCC, has the authority to review, monitor, and approve all GMO-related activities, including import, export, transportation, manufacture, use, and sale.
GEAC is a statutory body established under the Environment Act, 1986
Additionally, GM foods must comply with the regulations set by the
Food Safety and Standards Authority of India
(FSSAI).
Currently,
cotton is the only GM crop approved for commercial cultivation in India
News Summary:
The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change has introduced new rules mandating experts on the
to disclose any potential
conflict of interest
Disclosure of Conflicts
Expert members must disclose any direct or indirect association with matters being discussed in GEAC meetings.
Experts are expected to recuse themselves from discussions unless specifically requested by the committee.
Background Checks
Selected members must submit detailed forms listing their professional affiliations from the past decade.
Supreme Court Directive
The amendments follow a Supreme Court directive from July 2023, which required the Centre to formulate a national policy on GM crops.
The court highlighted the need for a process to address conflicts of interest after allegations surfaced regarding links between committee members and biotech companies like Monsanto (now Bayer CropScience).
Context of GM Mustard
The rules come in the wake of the Centre’s controversial 2022 decision granting conditional approval for GM mustard crops.
The Supreme Court delivered a split verdict on this decision, leaving the final resolution to a future bench.
Significance:
These measures aim to enhance the credibility of the GEAC by ensuring that decisions on GM crops are transparent, unbiased, and free from external influence.
This move addresses long-standing concerns over corporate affiliations influencing policy and regulatory decisions in India's GM crop sector.

Places in news
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline;
Mains level:
Geopolitical tension in Europe;
Why in the News?
For over 40 years, Russian gas has been transported to Europe through Ukraine, but these supplies are set to cease on January 1, following Ukraine’s Naftogaz decision not to renew its most recent five-year transit agreement with Russia’s Gazprom.
Note:
Student you can use this content in Prelims for facts related to map and mains exam for substantiate the argument related to geopolitical tension in Europe.
Do you know about the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline?
The Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline, also known as the
Brotherhood pipeline,
is a significant natural gas export route from
Russia to Europe
, primarily
traversing Ukraine.
The pipeline starts at the Urengoy gas field in northwest Siberia and extends southwest to Uzhhorod, Ukraine, near the Slovakian border.
It spans approximately 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles), with about 1,160 kilometers (720 miles) located in Ukraine.
The pipeline was commissioned in 1984 and has been a crucial part of Russia’s gas export strategy to Europe.
What is the volume of gas supplied through Ukraine?
Historical Context:
At its peak, the pipeline system, including the
delivered approximately 201 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to Europe in 2018. However, this volume has drastically decreased over the years due to geopolitical tensions and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
Recent Figures:
In 2023, only about 15 bcm of gas was shipped through Ukraine, a significant drop from 65 bcm when the last five-year contract began in 2020.
What are the Possible Impacts?
Economic Consequences for Ukraine:
Ukraine is expected to lose up to $1 billion annually in transit fees due to the cessation of gas flows. To mitigate this loss, it plans to quadruple gas transmission tariffs for domestic consumers, which could burden its industry with additional costs exceeding $38.2 million per year.
Impact on Gazprom:
Russia’s Gazprom is projected to lose around $5 billion in gas sales as a result of this halted transit.
European Energy Security:
The European Union has prepared for this transition and does not anticipate immediate impacts on consumer prices.
Countries like Slovakia and Austria have secured alternative gas supplies from sources such as Norway and LNG imports from the U.S. and Qatar.
Hungary will continue receiving Russian gas through the
TurkStream pipeline
under the Black Sea.
Energy Crisis in Moldova:
The cessation has led to an energy emergency in
Transdniestria
, a breakaway region of
that relies on these transit flows, resulting in cutoffs of heating and hot water supplies for residents
Way forward:
Enhanced Energy Diversification:
Europe and Ukraine should continue to strengthen alternative energy supply routes, including LNG imports and renewable energy projects, to reduce reliance on Russian gas and ensure long-term energy security.
Support for Affected Regions:
Provide immediate humanitarian and financial assistance to regions like Transdniestria and Moldova for energy infrastructure upgrades, while encouraging energy-efficient solutions to mitigate the crisis.

Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
The
Union Cabinet
has approved the extension of the
One-time Special Package on Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)
beyond the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) scheme.
What is Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)?
DAP is a two-nutrient fertilizer that contains 18% nitrogen (N) and 46% phosphorus (P) as P2O5.
DAP is highly soluble in water and soil, releasing phosphate and ammonium that plants can use.
DAP is a popular choice for farming and other industries because of its high nutrient content and physical properties. It’s particularly effective in the early stages of plant development.
What is Fertilizer Subsidy in India?
Details
Ensures
affordable fertilizers
for farmers to boost
agricultural productivity
Applies to both
Urea
Phosphatic & Potassic (P&K)
fertilizers, each with distinct pricing/subsidy mechanisms.
Types of Subsidies
1. Urea Subsidy
Fixed MRP
: Urea is sold at a statutorily notified MRP (₹5,360/ton in 2023), irrespective of production costs.
Government Compensation
: Bridges the cost gap, making urea highly affordable but often
leading to overuse
2. Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) for P&K (2010)
Nutrient-Based Approach
: Subsidies depend on Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) content, promoting
balanced fertilization
Pricing Revision
: Subsidy rates are
reviewed annually or bi-annually
based on global market prices.
Objectives
: Improve soil health, nutrient efficiency, and ensure
affordability
of P&K fertilizers.
3. Subsidies as per New Investment Policy (NIP) for Urea (2012)
Self-Sufficiency Focus
: Encourages new urea plants and revival of old ones to
reduce imports
Investment Incentives
: Aim to
increase domestic production
through favourable policies and pricing.
Concerns Related to Subsidy
Overuse of Urea
: Low urea prices lead to excessive application, causing soil nutrient imbalance and environmental harm.
Fiscal Burden

Sanctions
Why in the News?
The United States has imposed sanctions on entities in Iran and Russia, accusing them of attempting to interfere in the 2024 US presidential election.
Understanding Sanctions: Purpose, Application, and Impact
Sanctions are strategic tools used to influence behavior, deter aggression, and enforce compliance with international norms.
Sanctions are commonly used to address counterterrorism, human rights abuses, nuclear proliferation, and election interference.
Types of Sanctions
Comprehensive Sanctions:
Broad measures against entire countries (e.g., U.S. embargo on Cuba).
Targeted (Smart) Sanctions:
Focused on specific individuals or entities (e.g., asset freezes, travel bans).
Common Forms:
Trade restrictions and arms embargoes.
Asset freezes and capital restraints.
Travel bans and reductions in foreign aid.
How sanctions work?
United States:
Managed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s
Office of Foreign Assets Control
OFAC
Targets include terrorism (e.g., al-Qaeda), nuclear programs (e.g., Iran), and election meddling (e.g., Russia).
Example: 2024 sanctions on Iranian and Russian entities for using AI to interfere in U.S. elections.
United Nations:
Imposed by the UN Security Council, requiring no veto from the five permanent members (U.S., UK, France, China, Russia).
Measures include asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes.
Example: Sanctions on North Korea to curb its nuclear weapons program.
Why are Sanctions Imposed?
Sanctions aim to:
Coerce:
Change policies or actions, such as dismantling nuclear programs.
Deter:
Prevent future aggression or cyberattacks.
Punish:
Impose costs for violating international norms.
Shame:
Isolate violators diplomatically and economically.
Impacts on Regional and Global Geopolitics
Economic Effects:

3.6% in 2023
, despite sanctions.
Shifting Alliances:
Targeted nations strengthen ties with others (e.g., Russia’s growing relations with
Trade Realignment:
EU sanctions on Russia accelerated Europe’s move to
renewable energy sources
Humanitarian Consequences:
Comprehensive sanctions can harm civilians, as seen in
Iraq
during the 1990s.
