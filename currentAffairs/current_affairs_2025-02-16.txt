**********President’s Rule in Manipur
Why in news?
Manipur was placed under President’s Rule on February 13, four days after Chief Minister N. Biren Singh resigned.
Ongoing ethnic violence between the Meiteis and Kuki-Zo communities since May 2023 and criticism of Singh’s handling of the conflict contributed to the crisis. This marks the 11th instance of President’s Rule in Manipur, the highest for any state.
What’s in today’s article?
President’s Rule: Key Provisions and Conditions
Past Instances of President’s Rule in India
Decline in the Frequency of President’s Rule
Manipur - Suspended Animation of Legislature
Constitutional Basis
President’s Rule is imposed under
Article 356
in case of the failure of constitutional machinery in a State.
It allows the President to take over State governance based on the Governor’s report or other inputs.
Powers Under President’s Rule
The State government and Governor’s functions are transferred to the Union government.
The State Assembly’s powers are transferred to Parliament.
The President cannot assume High Court powers.
Parliamentary Approval and Duration
The proclamation must be
laid before Parliament
and expires in
two months
unless ratified.
It can be renewed every
six months
, up to a
maximum of three years
After the
first year
, renewal requires either:
A national or State Emergency declaration, or
The Election Commission certifying that elections cannot be held.
Circumstances for Imposition
The Constitution does not specify exact conditions, leaving it to the President’s discretion.
A 2016 Lok Sabha report listed reasons such as:
Political instability (defections, coalition breakdowns, no-confidence motions).
Resignations of Chief Ministers.
Absence of a legislature in newly formed States.
Public agitations or law and order issues.
Militancy and insurgency.
Judicial Review
1994 S.R. Bommai vs Union of India
case outlined when President’s Rule can and cannot be imposed, though the Supreme Court clarified this was not an exhaustive list.
First Imposition and Early Cases
First instance
: Punjab (June 1951), when CM Gopi Chand Bhargava resigned due to internal differences.
Jammu & Kashmir
Longest duration
under President’s Rule—nearly
15 years
, including two continuous stints:
1990-1996 (6+ years).
2019-2024 (6+ years).
Most Affected States
: Now under President’s Rule for the 11th time.
Uttar Pradesh
: Imposed 10 times.
Mass Impositions in 1977 & 1980
: Morarji Desai’s government imposed
President’s Rule in nine Congress-ruled States
, citing loss of public confidence.
: Indira Gandhi’s government
retaliated
, imposing it in
nine States
after returning to power.
Supreme Court’s stance
: Refused to intervene in these mass dismissals.
Statistics
1950-1994: 100 instances (average 2.5 times per year).
1994-2024: 30 instances (average once per year).
Recent trends
First imposition in almost four years: Manipur (2025), last seen in Puducherry (2021).
Since 2014: 11 instances, including four in J&K.
Of these, the courts have struck down the proclamation twice, in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
Impact of the Bommai Judgment (1994)
The Supreme Court’s nine-judge Bench ruled that courts could review the President’s proclamation.
Review criteria:
Whether it was issued based on any material evidence.
Whether the material was relevant.
Whether the proclamation was issued in bad faith (mala fide).
Former Attorney-General Soli Sorabjee noted that
this allowed courts to strike down unconstitutional proclamations, deterring misuse
In Manipur’s case, President’s Rule has been imposed, but the
State Assembly has not been dissolved
The Assembly is
inactive
but can be
revived
once President’s Rule is revoked and a new government is formed.
Legal Interpretation and the Bommai Judgment
In this case, the Supreme Court held that:
A suspended Assembly is not dissolved; it remains intact.
Once President’s Rule is revoked, the Assembly automatically resumes functioning.
Giving the President unfettered power to dissolve Assemblies under Article 356 could be dangerous.
Constitutional Debate
The Constitution does not explicitly mention "suspended animation."
Hence, as per the experts, if Parliament assumes all legislative powers, keeping the Assembly intact serves no real purpose.
They call it unconstitutional.

**********Proposed immigration law
Why in news?
The Union Ministry of Home Affairs is set to introduce the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025, in the Budget session beginning March 10.
This comprehensive legislation aims to consolidate and modernize India's immigration framework by repealing four existing laws.
What’s in today’s article?
Need for Immigration and Foreigners Bill 2025
Significant Provisions of the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025
Provisions for Entry and Stay of Foreigners in India
Provisions for Detection, Deportation, and Detention of Foreigners
Mechanisms to Track the Movement of Foreigners
Need for a new law
Existing Laws and Their Historical Context
Matters related to foreigners and immigration are currently governed by four laws:
Foreigners Act, 1946
Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920
Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939
Immigration (Carriers’ Liability) Act, 2000
Three of these Acts were enacted during
pre-Constitution times
, specifically during
World Wars I and II
, under extraordinary circumstances.
While these laws share
common objectives
, they contain
overlapping provisions
, leading to redundancy and inefficiencies.
A new,
is required to address modern immigration challenges.
Objectives of the Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025
Avoid Multiplicity of Laws
: Streamline regulations governing passports, visas, and foreigner registration.
Ensure Efficient Immigration Management
: Establish clear legal provisions for entry, exit, and movement of foreigners.
Strengthen National Security
: Improve regulatory control over visa issuance, registration, and enforcement measures.
This Bill aims to streamline, modernize, and strengthen immigration regulations while enhancing national security and compliance mechanisms.
Comprehensive Consolidation of Immigration Laws
The Bill merges multiple existing laws into a single framework.
Clearly defines the
roles and functions
Immigration Officer
and the
Bureau of Immigration (BoI)
Provides
legal backing
for immigration functions, which were previously handled without a dedicated statutory basis.
Clear Guidelines on Passport, Visa, and Foreigner Registration
Establishes legal provisions for
passport and visa requirements
Strengthens regulations for
registration and monitoring of foreigners
entering or residing in India.
Responsibilities of Educational and Medical Institutions
Defines
obligations
universities, hospitals, nursing homes, and medical institutions
admitting foreign nationals.
Previously, foreigners had to register with the
Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO)
, but no formal rules governed institutions accepting them.
Existing rule requiring hotels and guest houses to report foreigners' passport details to the police remains in place.
Carrier Liability and Enforcement Provisions
Strengthens provisions related to the
liability of carriers
, such as airlines and transport operators, in ensuring compliance with immigration laws.
Retention of the ‘Burden of Proof’ Clause
Maintains the existing legal provision where the
burden of proof
lies on the individual to establish that they are
not a foreigner
if questioned by authorities.
Expanded Grounds for Denial of Entry and Stay
The Bill introduces new grounds to
refuse entry or stay
of a foreigner in India, including:
Threat to national security, sovereignty, and integrity of India.
Impact on relations with a foreign state.
Public health concerns.
Other grounds specified by the Central Government
Immigration Officer’s decision
on entry or stay will be
final and binding
Previously, foreigners were denied entry based on executive orders, without specific legal mention.
Government’s Power to Remove Foreigners
The Bill grants the
Central Government authority
to:
Issue removal orders for foreigners.
Delegate powers to relevant authorities.
Grant exemptions in specific cases.
Existing laws like
Section 3 of the Foreigners Act, 1946
Section 5 of the Passport Act, 1920
, already provide for such removals, but the Bill consolidates and strengthens these provisions.
States Empowered to Detect and Deport Undocumented Migrants
The Central Government does not have a dedicated federal police force for detecting and deporting illegal foreigners.
The responsibility for
identifying and deporting undocumented migrants is entrusted to State police
Provisions for ‘Supervised Residence’ Instead of Detention Centres
The Bill does not use the term ‘detention centres’.
Clause 13
mandates that foreigners
reside in designated areas under supervision
, subject to rules on:
Maintenance and discipline.
Punishment for breaches of discipline.
Restricted access to such areas as per government regulations.
Identification of Overstaying Foreigners:
The MHA has directed States to form two committees to identify foreigners who:
Entered before and after January 1, 2011.
Overstayed beyond their visa period.
Tracking Through the e-FRRO Portal
Details of foreigners violating visa rules are uploaded on
e-FRRO portal
, accessible to the
local police
. Their information is also shared with:
Government departments handling welfare schemes.
Driving licence and PAN databases to prevent fraudulent document procurement.
The UIDAI has been asked to create a negative list of Aadhaar cards obtained fraudulently based on police investigations.
Foreigners Identification Portal:
The MHA has operationalized a dedicated portal for the State police to:
Upload biometrics and other details of illegal foreigners.
Track and identify migrants for deportation.
Prevent them from acquiring Indian identity documents like Aadhaar.
