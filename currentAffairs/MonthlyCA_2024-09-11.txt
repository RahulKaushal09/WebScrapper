Climate Change Impact on Panama Canal
Source: IE
Why in News?
The
, a critical global
shipping lane
, is facing significant challenges due to prolonged drought conditions exacerbated by
climate change
.
This situation has led to reduced water levels in
Lake Gatun
, prompting discussions about long-term
solutions to sustain the Panama canal’s operations.
What is the Impact of Climate Change on the Panama Canal?
Drought and Reduced Passage of Ships:
The Panama Canal is experiencing a prolonged
that began in early 2023.
Rainfall in October 2023 was
43% below average
, making it the driest October since the 1950s.
Traffic through the canal dropped to as low as
22 ships per day in December 2023
, down from the usual
36 to 38 ships
, due to low water levels in Lake Gatun.
Restriction on Size of Ships:
Lower water levels restrict the size of ships that can pass through the canal, as larger, heavier vessels are at higher risk of
running aground
in shallower waters.
Large ships also require more lake water to lift them in the locks.
Effect on Global Trade:
The Panama Canal accounts for
5% of global shipping
, so disruptions here affect the worldwide supply chain, resulting in delayed shipments, more fuel usage, and
GDP losses
Ships are forced to take the long way around i.e., travelling down to the southern points of South America.
What are Key Facts about the Panama Canal?
About Panama Canal:
It is an
artificial
82 kilometers waterway in Panama that connects the
Atlantic Ocean
with the
Pacific Ocean
It cuts across the
Isthmus of Panama
, and is a conduit for maritime trade.
It saves approximately 12,600 km in
a trip between New York and San Francisco.
first ship
passed through the Panama Canal on
15
August 1914
Functioning of Panama Canal:
It is a sophisticated, highly-engineered system which uses a system of
locks and elevators
to take ships from one end to the other.
This is needed because the t
wo oceans that the Panama Canal connects do not lie at the same elevation
, with the Pacific slightly higher than the Atlantic.
For a ship entering the canal through the Atlantic, it
needs to gain elevation during its journey to the Pacific
. This is achieved using a
lock system
that lifts and drops vessels to the required sea level at either end of the canal.
Locks are either
flooded (to gain elevation)
drained (to lose elevation)
, and act as water elevators.
In total, the system comprises
12 locks in total
which are serviced using artificial lakes and channels.

Kosi-Mechi River Linking Project
Source: DTE
Why in News?
The
Kosi-Mechi River Linking Project,
part of India’s ambitious
National Perspective Plan (NPP) for interlinking rivers,
has become a point of contention.
Flood
victims in Bihar have protested against its implementation.
The project is aimed at improving irrigation in the region. However, locals argue that it
fails to address the critical issue of flood control,
which affects them annually.
What are the Key Facts About the Kosi-Mechi River Linking Project?
About:
The project involves linking the
Kosi River
with the Mechi River,
a tributary of the
Mahananda River,
impacting regions in Bihar and Nepal.
Aims to provide annual irrigation to 4.74 lakh hectares (2.99 lakh hectares in Bihar) and 24 million cubic meters (MCM) of domestic and industrial water supply.
Upon completion, the project is expected to release an additional 5,247 cubic feet per second (cusecs) of water from the Kosi barrage.
The project is overseen by the
National Water Development Agency (NWDA),
under the
Union Ministry of Jal Shakti (Water Resources).
Concerns:
The project is designed primarily for irrigation purposes, with an aim to support 215,000 hectares of agricultural land in the Mahananda river basin during the
Kharif season.
Despite government claims, the project does not have a
significant flood control component,
which is a major concern for the flood-prone region.
The project will release only 5,247 cubic feet per second (cusecs) of additional water from the barrage, which is negligible compared to the barrage's capacity of 900,000 cusecs.
Locals argue that such a
small reduction in water flow will not be effective in preventing the annual flooding
that devastates the region.
Flooding and
land erosion
have destroyed homes and inundated crops, affecting local livelihoods and villagers living between embankments.
The project's focus on irrigation does not address these immediate and recurring challenges.
What are the Key Facts About Kosi River and Mechi River?
Kosi River:
It is known as the
"Sorrow of Bihar,"
originates over 7,000 metres above sea level in the Himalayas, within the catchment area of
Mount Everest
Kanchenjunga.
Flowing through China, Nepal, and India, it enters India near Hanuman Nagar and merges with the
Ganga River
near Kursela in Katihar district Bihar.
The Kosi River is formed by the confluence of three main streams: the
Sun Kosi, Arun Kosi, and Tamur Kosi.
The Kosi river is known for its
tendency to shift its course westward,
having moved 112 km over the last 200 years, devastating agricultural lands in Darbhanga, Saharsa and Purnea districts.
Tributaries:
The river has
several important tributaries, including the
Trijunga, Bhutahi Balan, Kamla Balan, and Bagmati,
all of which join the Kosi River during its course through the plains.
<img caption="false" class="content-img" src="http://drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1724053512_Kosi_River.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="500"/>
Mechi River:
It is a
trans-boundary river flowing through Nepal and India
. It is a
tributary of the Mahananda River.
The river Mechi is a
perennial river
which rises in the inner valley of the
Himalaya in Mahabharat range of hills in Nepal
and then flows through the Indian state of Bihar to join the Mahananda in Kishanganj district.
What is the National Perspective Plan for Interlinking Rivers?
NPP was formulated in 1980 by the Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti), to
develop water resources through the inter-basin transfer of water.
Components:
The plan is divided into two main components: the
Himalayan Rivers Development Component and the Peninsular Rivers Development Component.
Projects Identified:
30 link projects have been identified, with 16 under the Peninsular Component and 14 under the Himalayan Component.
Key Projects Under Peninsular Component:
Mahanadi-Godavari Links,
Godavari-Krishna Links, Par-Tapi-Narmada Link, and
Ken-Betwa Link
(first project under the NPP to begin implementation).
Key Projects Under Himalayan Component:
Kosi-Ghaghra Link, Ganga (Farakka)-Damodar-Subernarekha Link, and Kosi-Mechi Link.
Significance:
The NPP aims to
manage flood risks in the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin.
It seeks to address
water shortages in western and peninsular states
such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.
The plan aims to
improve irrigation in water-scarce regions
, boosting agricultural productivity and thereby enhancing food security and potentially doubling farmers' incomes.
It will facilitate the development of
infrastructure for freight movement
via environmentally friendly
inland waterways.
The NPP is designed to
utilise surface water to alleviate
groundwater depletion
and reduce the amount of freshwater flowing into the sea.
Challenges:
Comprehensive feasibility studies assessing the economic, social, and ecological impacts are often incomplete or lacking.
Inadequate data can lead to uncertainties about the project's effectiveness and potential unintended consequences.
Water being a state subject complicates agreements on
water sharing between states
, leading to potential disputes
. For example, issues have arisen between Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
Large-scale water transfers can
worsen flooding,
disrupting local ecosystems and communities. Additionally, changes in
water flow may lead to water logging and increased salinity
in agricultural lands, negatively affecting soil quality and crop yields.
The extensive financial outlay for construction, maintenance, and operation of dams, canals, and related infrastructure presents a significant economic burden.
Climate change
can alter rainfall patterns, which may affect the availability and distribution of water, potentially undermining the intended benefits of the interlinking projects.

Way Forward
Develop a comprehensive plan for
floodplain zoning,
restricting settlements and critical infrastructure in high-risk areas. Encourage
flood-resistant housing
and cropping patterns in designated zones.
Invest in fortifying embankments along the Kosi River to prevent breaches and reduce inundation
Develop a clear mechanism to
ensure equitable distribution of project benefits.
Flood-prone areas should see significant investments in flood control measures, while water-scarce regions benefit from improved irrigation infrastructure.
Given the challenges faced by the Interlinking of Rivers plan, adopting the
National Waterways Project (NWP)
offers a promising alternative
The NWP, which uses excess floodwaters that currently flow into the sea,  avoids state disputes over water sharing and provides a more cost-effective solution for irrigation and power generation.
Drishti Mains Question:
Q.
Discuss the objectives and expected benefits of the Kosi-Mechi River Linking Project. How does it align with the broader goals of the National Perspective Plan for Interlinking Rivers?

Antarctica is experiencing its second intense winter heatwave in two years, with ground temperatures averaging 10°C above normal since mid-July and reaching up to 28°C higher on some days.
Status of Temperatures in East Antarctica
Current Temperature Levels:
Temperatures in East Antarctica range between minus 25°C to minus 30°C.
Typical Winter Temperatures:
Normally, deep-winter temperatures in this region vary between minus 50°C to minus 60°C.
<img alt="Antarctica's Deep-Winter Heatwave" class="wp-image-125466 alignright" decoding="async" height="282" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" src="https://pwonlyias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/94-66b61c9c97917.webp" srcset="https://pwonlyias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/94-66b61c9c97917.webp 667w, https://pwonlyias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/94-66b61c9c97917-300x277.webp 300w" width="306"/>
About Heat Wave
Heat Wave:
A heat wave is a period of unusually high temperatures, exceeding normal maximum temperatures for the summer season.
Timing:
Heat waves commonly occur between March and June, and occasionally extend into July.
Trends:
Global climate change is leading to more frequent and intense heat waves, with higher peak temperatures and longer durations.

Reasons for the Heatwave in Antarctica
Weakening of the Polar Vortex
The primary culprit behind the heatwave is the
weakening of the polar vortex.
The polar vortex is a band of cold air and low-pressure systems that circulates around the Earth’s poles in the stratosphere.
Normally, this vortex keeps cold air trapped and prevents warm air from entering.
However, large-scale atmospheric waves disrupted the vortex this year, allowing warm air to infiltrate the region.
Reduced Antarctic Sea Ice
Sea Ice Role:
Sea ice helps maintain low temperatures in polar regions by reflecting sunlight back into space and acting as a barrier between the cold air and warmer water below.
A significant decline in Antarctic sea ice extent contributed to the heatwave.
Less sea ice means more sunlight is absorbed, leading to warmer temperatures.
Accelerated Warming in Antarctica
Antarctica is warming at a rate of 0.22°C to 0.32°C per decade, nearly twice as fast as the global average due to climate change.
This rapid warming makes the region more susceptible to extreme weather events like heat waves.
The overall trend of global warming exacerbates the impact of other factors.

Consequences of Antarctica’s Heatwave
Ecosystem Disruption
Biodiversity Impact
: The heatwave could disrupt Antarctic ecosystems, affecting species that depend on cold, stable conditions.
This could lead to changes in the food chain and impact global biodiversity.
Habitat Loss
: As ice melts, habitats for cold-adapted species like penguins and seals may shrink, leading to potential declines in their populations.
Historical Ice Loss and Heat Wave Impact in  Antarctica
Period
Ice Loss/Impact
2000s-2010s
280% more ice mass loss than 1980s-1990s
March 2022
East Antarctic temperatures rose above 39°C, leading to ice sheet collapse (area of Rome)
Antarctic Ice Sheet Impact
: The heatwave could accelerate the loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which, along with the Greenland Ice Sheet, is crucial for global ice reserves.
The Antarctic Ice Sheet is vital for global ocean circulation, which distributes heat, carbon, nutrients, and freshwater.
Global Sea Level Threat
: If melted, the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which holds over
60% of the world’s freshwater
, could significantly raise global sea levels and displace millions living near coastlines.
Feedback Loops and Further Wrming
Albedo Effect
: The loss of ice reduces the Earth’s albedo, or its ability to reflect sunlight.
Less ice means more sunlight is absorbed by the ocean, leading to further warming and accelerated ice melt.
Potential Runaway Warming
: This process could create a feedback loop, where warming leads to more ice melt, which in turn leads to further warming, potentially pushing the Antarctic climate system toward irreversible changes.
Global Climate Implications
Extreme Weather
: Changes in Antarctic conditions could influence global weather patterns, leading to more extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, and floods in other parts of the world.
Impact on Global Carbon Cycle
: The disruption of the ocean circulation system could affect the global carbon cycle, potentially leading to higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and exacerbating global warming.
Slowing Circulation
: Melting ice is reducing surface water salinity and density, slowing down ocean circulation and impacting climate regulation.
Significance of Antarctica
Climate Regulation:
Climate regulation:
Antarctica ice sheet reflects a lot of solar energy which helps to control temperature of the earth.
Ocean circulation:
It plays a major role in ocean circulation which impacts the climate patterns around the world.
Freshwater Storage:
Antarctica ice sheet is the largest reservoir of freshwater on the earth.
It holds around 60 metres of sea level equivalent.
Biodiversity:
Despite its harsh climatic condition, it supports various wildlife including penguins, seals, and various seabirds.
Scientific Research:
Ice cores in Antarctica provide useful data on Earth’s climate history over a million of years.
It acts as a natural laboratory for studying life in harsh environments and understanding the whole ecosystem.

Overview:
Scientists have recently discovered a strange phenomenon, dubbed “dark oxygen” in the deep sea.
About Dark Oxygen:
that is being
produced in complete darkness
thousands of feet
below the ocean surface
is termed dark oxygen.
Why is the discovery important?
Until now, it
was thought that oxygen
created only through photosynthesis
, a process that requires sunlight.
Oceanic plankton, drifting plants, algae, and some bacteria are the primary elements attributed to the production of oxygen in the ocean. All these organisms are capable of photosynthesis.
The
production of oxygen at such depths
thought to be impossiblebecause
there
isn't enough sunlight for
plants to do
However,
in this case
not being produced by plants
oxygen comes out of Polymetallic nodules
that are similar in resemblance to lumps of coal.
These nodules, made up of metals like manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and lithium, can
generate oxygen through electrochemical activity
even in the
absence of light.
They are
splitting H2O molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
Key Facts about Polymetallic Nodules:
Polymetallic nodules, also known as
manganese nodules
, are
small, rounded accretions
found
on the seabed
of the deep ocean floor.
These nodules are
composed of a mixture of metals and minerals
, including
manganese, iron, nickel, copper
, cobalt, and traces of other valuable elements such as
platinum, rare earth elements
form through
a slow and
gradual process over millions of years.
develop as concentric layers around a central nucleus,
which can be a shell fragment, a shark tooth, or a piece of basaltic rock.
The layers are
primarily composed of manganese and iron oxides
, with other metals being deposited along with them.
These metals are really
important for the production of lithium-ion batteries
used in electric vehicle batteries, mobile phones, wind turbines, solar panels, etc.
They are mainly found in the
north-central Pacific Ocean
, the
southeastern Pacific Ocean
, and the
northern Indian Ocean.
It is said that there may be
enough polymetallic nodules in
an area of the
called the
Clarion-Clipperton Zone
meet global energy demands for decades
after.
Q1: What is photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar. Most life on Earth depends on photosynthesis.The process is carried out by plants, algae, and some types of bacteria, which capture energy from sunlight to produce oxygen (O2) and chemical energy stored in glucose (a sugar). Herbivores then obtain this energy by eating plants, and carnivores obtain it by eating herbivores.

What are the Different Underwater Structures/Relief on the Ocean Floor?
About:
Ocean Floor or Seabed
is the
bottom of the water
that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and it includes elements like
Phosphorus, Gold, Silver, Copper, Zinc, and Nickel.
The primary causes of Ocean Relief are interactions between tectonic plates, and erosional, depositional, and volcanic processes.
Zones of Ocean Floor:
Continental Shelf:
shallowest and widest
part of the ocean floor.
Extends
from the coast to the edge
of the continent, where it drops sharply into the continental slope.
Rich in marine life and resources, such as
fish, oil, and gas.
Continental Slope:
The steep slope that
connects the continental shelf to the abyssal plain
Cut by
deep canyons and valleys
that are formed by underwater landslides and rivers of sediment.
Home to some
deep-sea creatures, such as octopuses, squids, and anglerfish.
Continental Rise:
Made up of thick sequences of continental material that
accumulate between the continental slope and the abyssal plain.
It can rise from processes such as the
downhill movement of sediment
, the settling of particles carried by
underwater currents,
and the slow settling of both non-living and living
particles from above.
Abyssal Plain:
flattest
Covers
most of the ocean basin
and lies between 4,000 and 6,000 meters below sea level.
Covered by a
thick layer of fine sediment
s that are carried by
ocean currents
and settle on the seafloor.
Inhabited by some of the most
bizarre and mysterious animals
on Earth, such as giant tube worms, bioluminescent fish, and vampire squids.
Oceanic Deeps or Trenches:
These areas are the
deepest parts
of the oceans.
The trenches are relatively
steep sided, narrow basins.
They are some 3-5 km deeper than the surrounding ocean floor.
They occur at the
bases of continental slopes a
nd along island arcs and are associated with active volcanoes and strong earthquakes, so are very significant in the study of plate movements.
Minor Relief Features of Ocean Floor:
Submarine Canyons:
They are significant geological structures found on continental margins, serving as connections between the
upper continental shelf
They are deep, narrow valleys featuring vertical sidewalls and steep slopes, similar to land valleys.
Mid Oceanic Ridges
: They are found along
diverging plate boundaries
where tectonic plates move apart, and the gap is filled by upwelling magma that solidifies to form new oceanic crust.
These ridges consist of two parallel mountain ranges separated by a deep depression. The mountain peaks can reach heights of up to 2,500 meters.
Seamounts and Guyots: Seamounts
undersea mountains
formed by volcanic activity that risehundreds or thousands of feet from the sea floor, often near plate boundaries. Example the
Emperor seamount,
an extension of the
Hawaiian Islands
in Pacific Ocean
flat-topped seamounts
that have been submerged as the seafloor gradually sinks away from oceanic ridges.
Atoll:
It is a
ring-shaped formation of coral reefs or islands
that encircles a
lagoon
, typically developing seamounts.
These structures
consist of low islands in tropical oceans,
with the reef surrounding a central depression that can contain various types of water, including seawater, fresh water, or brackish water.

Q1
: What are Cirrus Clouds?
are delicate, feathery clouds that are made mostly of ice crystals. They are thin and wispy in appearance, often appearing as delicate, high-altitude filaments or strands. Their wispy shape comes from wind currents, which twist and spread the ice crystals into strands. They are usually white or have a light gray color. In the daytime, they are whiter than any other cloud in the sky. They are commonly known as "mare's tails" because they are shaped like the tail of a horse.

Impact of Climate Change on Earth's Rotational Dynamics
Source: TH
Why in News?
Recent research highlights that
melting polar ice caps
due to
climate change
are causing the
Earth to spin more slowly,
leading to minute changes in the duration of a day.
This phenomenon, while not immediately noticeable in daily lives, could have significant implications for technology reliant on precise timekeeping.
How is Climate Change Affecting Earth's Rotation?
Melting Ice Caps:
The melting of polar ice sheets causes
water to flow towards the equator
, increasing the
Earth's oblateness and moment of inertia.
Studies show that over the last two decades, the Earth’s rotation has slowed by
approximately 1.3 milliseconds per century.
The principle of
angular momentum
explains this effect, as polar ice melts and moves towards the equator, the
Earth's moment of inertia (mass distribution near the equator)
increases, causing its
rotational speed (velocity)
to decrease to conserve
angular momentum, resulting in a slower spin
Projections indicate that
if high emission scenarios persist,
this rate may
increase to 2.6 milliseconds per century,
making climate change a dominant factor in the Earth's rotational slowdown.
Axis Shifts:
The melting ice also
influences the Earth’s axis of rotation,
causing a slight but
measurable shift.
This movement, while small, is another indicator of how climate change impacts fundamental Earth processes.
The Earth’s rotational axis is tilted relative to its geographic axis. This tilt causes a phenomenon known as the
Chandler wobble, which can affect rotational timing and stability.
What are the Implications of Slowdown of Earth's Rotation?
Leap Seconds:
The rotation of the Earth affects the need for
leap seconds
to synchronize
atomic clocks with solar time.
A slowdown in rotation may necessitate the addition of leap seconds, impacting systems reliant on precise timekeeping.
This adjustment can cause issues in technology, such as
network outages or discrepancies in data timestamps.
Global Positioning Systems (GPS)
GPS satellites rely on precise time measurements. Variations in Earth’s rotation can affect the
accuracy of GPS systems, potentially leading to minor errors in navigation
and location services.
Sea Level Rise:
The redistribution of mass from melting polar ice contributes to
changes in sea levels.
A slowdown in Earth's rotation can affect ocean currents, including the
Global Mean Ocean Circulation (GMOC),
potentially influencing regional climate patterns and exacerbating issues related to sea level rise.
GMOC is a large-scale system that moves water, heat, and nutrients across the world's oceans. It plays a vital role in regulating global climate by redistributing heat between regions.

Antarctica's Deep Winter Heatwaves
Source: IE
Why in News?
Recently, Antarctica has been experiencing a significant
deep-winter heatwave
, marking the second instance of record-breaking temperatures in two years.
Ground temperatures have risen by an average of 10 degrees Celsius above normal since mid-July 2024, with some areas experiencing increases of up to 28 degrees Celsius.

What are the Causes of Deep-Winter Heat Waves in Antarctica?
Weakening of the Polar Vortex:
The
polar vortex
(also known as polar pig)
is a large
area of low pressure
and
cold air surrounding both of the Earth’s poles
The term
"vortex"
refers to the
counterclockwise flow of air
that helps keep the
colder air near the Poles
. It always exists near the poles, but
weakens in summer
and strengthens in winter
Higher temperatures
powerful atmospheric waves
(periodic disturbances in the fields of atmospheric variables)
disrupted the vortex.
This allowed
cold air to escape and warm air from above to descend.
The arrival of this warm air led to a rise in temperatures in the region.
Reduction of Antarctic Sea Ice
sea ice
has reached historically low levels,
reducing its ability to reflect solar energy
act as a barrier between cold air and warmer waters
. This loss contributes to
rising global temperatures.
High Rate of Global Warming:
is experiencing
warming at a rate nearly double
that of the global average, estimated at
0.22 to 0.32 degrees Celsius per decade
As per
IPCC
estimates
as a whole is warming at the rate of
0.14-0.18 degrees Celsius per decade.
accelerated warming
is primarily driven by
anthropogenic climate change
, which exacerbates the effects of natural climate variability.
Impact of the Southern Ocean
warming Southern Ocean absorbs more heat
due to reduced sea ice, creating a feedback loop that
raises air temperatures over Antarctica
and increases the risk of extreme weather events.

What are the Consequences of Heat Waves in Antarctica?
Accelerated Ice Melt:
Antarctica's rising winter temperatures are
accelerating ice mass loss
, with recent decades seeing a
280% increase
compared to the 1980s and 1990s.
In March 2022, a
heat wave caused a section of ice of around 1300 square kilometres
to collapse, highlighting the significant risk of rising global sea levels.
Global Sea Level Rise
: The Antarctic ice Sheet covers
98% of Antarctica
and contains
over 60% of the world's freshwater
A slight increase of a few feet in sea levels could result in the displacement of around
230 million people
residing
within 3 feet of existing high tide lines,
posing a significant threat to coastal cities and ecosystems.
Disruption of Ocean Circulation
: The influx of freshwater from melting ice alters the
salinity and density of ocean waters,
slowing down
global ocean circulation.
A 2023 study revealed that this slowdown
weakens the ocean's capacity to store and transport heat, carbon, and nutrients
, which are essential for climate regulation.
Reduced ocean circulation
ecreases heat and CO2 absorption
, intensifying global warming and increasing the frequency of
that affect
and human populations worldwide.
Ecosystem Disruption:
Temperature changes and
ice loss disrupt local ecosystems, threatening species
dependent on stable ice, leading to biodiversity loss and altering global food webs.
For example species like
polar bears
penguins
rely on
stable ice for survival
Feedback Loops:
Melting ice reduces sunlight reflection
(albedo effect)
, increasing heat absorption by oceans and land, which accelerates further ice melt, creating a feedback loop that worsens climate change.
Albedo
is an expression of the
ability of surfaces to reflect sunlight
(heat from the sun).

Tectonic Events Changed the Course of Ganga
Source: TH
Recently, Researchers studied river channels in the
Ganges delta
in Bangladesh.
They discovered a
paleochannel
(
ancient river channel)
indicating the Ganga had changed its course abruptly about 2,500 years ago due to an earthquake.
How Earthquakes Impact the Course of a River Ganga?
Earthquake Origin:
The researchers speculated the earthquake could have originated from the
Indo-Burma mountain ranges
or the
Shillong hills
, where the Indian and Eurasian
tectonic plates
meet.
Impact:
The discovery highlights that large earthquakes can trigger major river
avulsions
(changes in the course of river flow), which could lead to
devastating
floods
, especially in densely populated regions like the
Ganges-Meghna-
Brahmaputra delta.
Earthquake Evidence:
Seismite Formation: Seismites
(sedimentary beds deformed by seismic movements) are formed when
seismic waves
pressurise a layer of watery sand, causing it to burst through mud layers.
Sand Dikes:
Researchers found two large
sand dikes
a kilometre to the east of the palaeochannel. Sand Dikes are formed when earthquakes disturb the river bed and cause sediments to flow (
liquefaction)
Dating Techniques:
Researchers used
optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)
dating
to estimate the timing of the avulsion and the formation of the sand dikes. They determined that both events occurred around 2,500 years ago, suggesting the earthquake caused the river avulsion.
Future Hazards and Recommendations
Potential Impac
t: A similar earthquake today could
areas affecting up to 170 million people in India and Bangladesh.
Increased Risk:
Factors such as rapid
subsidence
and climate change-induced sea level rise increase the risk of river avulsions.
Future Research
: Emphasis should be placed on understanding the frequency of quake-driven avulsions and improving earthquake forecasting.
Preparedness
: There is a need for
collaboration between India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar for research, monitoring,
and preparedness to mitigate the risks
associated with such natural disasters.

What are Key Facts About the Ganga River System?
originates as Bhagirathi from
Gangotri Glacier, Uttarakhand
at an elevation of 3,892 m.
Many small streams comprise the
headwaters
of the Ganga. The important among these are
Alaknanda, Dhauliganga, Pindar, Mandakini
Bhilangana.
At Devprayag, where Alaknanda joins Bhagirathi, the river acquires the name Ganga. It traverses 2525 km before flowing into the Bay of Bengal.
The Ganga is
formed from the 6 headstreams and their five confluences.

meets the Yamuna in Allahabad.
Delta and Outflow:
After a journey of
around 2,510 kilometres, the Ganga River merges with the Brahmaputra River in Bangladesh,
forming the Padma River.
Padma River then joins the Meghna River
and flows into the Bay of Bengal through the Meghna Estuary.

What are the Different Underwater Structures/Relief on the Ocean Floor?
About:
Ocean Floor or Seabed
is the
bottom of the water
that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and it includes elements like
Phosphorus, Gold, Silver, Copper, Zinc, and Nickel.
The primary causes of Ocean Relief are interactions between tectonic plates, and erosional, depositional, and volcanic processes.
Zones of Ocean Floor:
Continental Shelf:
shallowest and widest
part of the ocean floor.
Extends
from the coast to the edge
of the continent, where it drops sharply into the continental slope.
Rich in marine life and resources, such as
fish, oil, and gas.
Continental Slope:
The steep slope that
connects the continental shelf to the abyssal plain
Cut by
deep canyons and valleys
that are formed by underwater landslides and rivers of sediment.
Home to some
deep-sea creatures, such as octopuses, squids, and anglerfish.
Continental Rise:
Made up of thick sequences of continental material that
accumulate between the continental slope and the abyssal plain.
It can rise from processes such as the
downhill movement of sediment
, the settling of particles carried by
underwater currents,
and the slow settling of both non-living and living
particles from above.
Abyssal Plain:
flattest
Covers
most of the ocean basin
and lies between 4,000 and 6,000 meters below sea level.
Covered by a
thick layer of fine sediment
s that are carried by
ocean currents
and settle on the seafloor.
Inhabited by some of the most
bizarre and mysterious animals
on Earth, such as giant tube worms, bioluminescent fish, and vampire squids.
Oceanic Deeps or Trenches:
These areas are the
deepest parts
of the oceans.
The trenches are relatively
steep sided, narrow basins.
They are some 3-5 km deeper than the surrounding ocean floor.
They occur at the
bases of continental slopes a
nd along island arcs and are associated with active volcanoes and strong earthquakes, so are very significant in the study of plate movements.
Minor Relief Features of Ocean Floor:
Submarine Canyons:
They are significant geological structures found on continental margins, serving as connections between the
upper continental shelf
They are deep, narrow valleys featuring vertical sidewalls and steep slopes, similar to land valleys.
Mid Oceanic Ridges
: They are found along
diverging plate boundaries
where tectonic plates move apart, and the gap is filled by upwelling magma that solidifies to form new oceanic crust.
These ridges consist of two parallel mountain ranges separated by a deep depression. The mountain peaks can reach heights of up to 2,500 meters.
Seamounts and Guyots: Seamounts
undersea mountains
formed by volcanic activity that risehundreds or thousands of feet from the sea floor, often near plate boundaries. Example the
Emperor seamount,
an extension of the
Hawaiian Islands
in Pacific Ocean
flat-topped seamounts
that have been submerged as the seafloor gradually sinks away from oceanic ridges.
Atoll:
It is a
ring-shaped formation of coral reefs or islands
that encircles a
lagoon
, typically developing seamounts.
These structures
consist of low islands in tropical oceans,
with the reef surrounding a central depression that can contain various types of water, including seawater, fresh water, or brackish water.
