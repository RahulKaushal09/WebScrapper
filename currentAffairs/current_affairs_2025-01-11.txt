**********What is Indo-Burmese pangolin?
Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) scientists recently discovered a pangolin species — the Indo-Burmese pangolin (Manis indoburmanica) — in Arunachal Pradesh.
About Manis indoburmanica:
It is a
new species of pangolin
genetically
distinct from Chinese
(Manis pentadactyla)
and Indian
(Manis crassicaudata)
pangolins
found in India.
The species has been named
(Manis indoburmanica).
Genetic analysis has shown that the Indo-Burmese pangolin is
8% different from
Chinese pangolin
The species diverged from the Chinese pangolin around 3.4 million years ago, probably owing to climatic and geological changes during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs.
The species is believed to inhabit parts of
Arunachal Pradesh, Assam,
and potentially extend into
Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar
It is found at altitudes ranging from 180 to 1830 meters above sea level and has
dark brown and olive-brown scales with a pinkish face
typical of other Asian pangolins
Key Facts about Pangolins:
Pangolins are
mammals
that belong to the family Manidae and are found in
Africa and Asia.
There are
eight different species
of pangolins:
four in Africa and four in Asia
They are unique because they are the
only mammals covered in large, protective keratin
, which they
use as armour
curling up into a ball when threatened
by predators.
myrmecophagous
, meaning they
primarily eat ants and termites
, using their
long, sticky tongues
to capture these insects.
Additionally, pangolins are
fossorial
, which means they are
adapted for digging
creating burrows
where they often reside.
Pangolins are among the
most trafficked animals globally
, partly due to the demand for their scales in traditional medicine and as luxury items.

**********Blinkit’s ‘10-Minute’ Ambulances and the Spectre of a Larger Malady
Context
The
relentless wail/ loud sound of an ambulance siren has become an indelible aspect of urban life in India
, symbolising the growing demand for emergency medical services.
An increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses and a rise in road accidents have significantly fuelled this demand,
making ambulance services an indispensable link in the healthcare delivery system.
However,
the current state of ambulance services in India reveals a mix of progress and persistent challenges
that call for urgent attention.
Evolution of Ambulances Services in India
The Role of NGOs and Early Innovations
significant shift occurred in the 1980s
when non-governmental organizations (NGOs) began filling the gaps left by the public health system.
Southern India emerged as a leader in this movement,
with voluntary and free ambulance services being introduced to cater to underserved populations.
These early initiatives laid the groundwork for more organised ambulance networks,
demonstrating the feasibility and importance of dedicated emergency transport.
State Government Initiatives
In subsequent decades,
state governments recognised the critical role of ambulances in improving public health outcomes.
Targeted services were introduced for vulnerable groups
, such as women in the reproductive age group and children under five, under state-sponsored programs.
The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), launched in 2005, further institutionalised these efforts
by integrating ambulance services into a broader public-private partnership framework.
Introduction of 108 Emergency Response
landmark initiative under NRHM was the establishment of the 108 Emergency Response
Service, which
became a model for ambulance services
across the country.
Operated through a public-private partnership, it provided free access to emergency transport,
significantly improving the reach of healthcare services in both urban and rural areas.
The 108 service not only addressed the immediate need for transport but also emphasised timely response, coordination with healthcare facilities
, and first aid administration during transit.
The Rise of Private Sector Players
past two decades have witnessed a surge in private sector involvement in ambulance services
, driven by rising healthcare demand and urbanization.
Corporate hospitals began offering their own ambulance fleets equipped with state-of-the-art facilities
, while standalone companies emerged to provide specialized services.
Recent innovations by private players,
such as Blinkit’s ‘10-minute’ ambulance service
, represent a bold attempt to address urban challenges like traffic congestion.
these initiatives also raise concerns about the practicality of such promises and the potential strain on service providers.
Unlike public and NGO-run services,
private ambulance operators often target middle- and high-income populations, leaving a significant portion of the population
dependent on government schemes or basic transport options.
The Shift Towards Specialisation
Basic Life Support (BLS) ambulances
, which were once the norm,
are now complemented by Advanced Life Support (ALS) units, ICU ambulances
, and air ambulances.
These advancements are indicative of a growing recognition
of the need for more sophisticated emergency care during transit.
the adoption of such specialised services remains limited to urban centres
and private facilities, reflecting a glaring disparity in access and quality.
Policy and Regulatory Challenges
Inadequate Definition and Standardization
One of the most pressing challenges is the
lack of a clear and uniform definition of ambulance services.
Many so-called ambulances are nothing more than patient transport vehicles
, lacking even basic life-support facilities.
Without clear guidelines on what constitutes an ambulance, the sector remains vulnerable
to substandard services.
For example,
studies have found that while BLS and ALS ambulances are available
, a significant proportion of these vehicles lack the equipment, infrastructure, or trained personnel to qualify as true emergency medical units.
Fragmented Regulatory Framework
regulatory landscape for ambulance services in India is highly fragmented,
with overlapping jurisdictions between central and state governments.
Each state has its own licensing requirements
, operational standards, and inspection protocols, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.
The lack of a centralised authority results in bureaucratic hurdles, delays in obtaining necessary approvals,
and opportunities for corruption.
For instance,
private ambulance operators often face challenges in navigating complex licensing processes,
which can deter them from entering the market or maintaining compliance.
Uneven Resource Allocation
Wealthier states with strong healthcare infrastructure,
such as Gujarat and Maharashtra, are
able to provide relatively robust ambulance services.
In contrast,
poorer and geographically challenging regions like the northeastern states suffer from acute shortages.
absence of a national policy for equitable resource allocation perpetuates these regional disparities
, leaving large swathes of the population underserved.
Traffic and Infrastructure Constraints
Even the
best-equipped ambulances struggle to navigate through crowded streets
, leading to delays in reaching patients or healthcare facilities.
This issue is particularly acute in metro cities
, where traffic jams can significantly impact the golden hour,
the critical period immediately following a medical emergency when timely intervention is most effective.
Challenges in Regulating Private Players
The rapid growth of private ambulance
services has introduced
additional complexities.
While private players have filled gaps in service availability,
their unregulated expansion has led to concerns about service quality, pricing, and ethical practices.
For instance, a
necdotal reports suggest that some private ambulance operators exploit patients
during emergencies by charging exorbitant fees or prioritizing profits over patient welfare.
The absence of price controls or quality benchmarks allows such practices to persist,
further undermining public trust in the sector.
Moreover,
private operators often cater to urban and affluent populations
, leaving rural and economically disadvantaged communities reliant on overstretched public services.
The Way Forward and Recommendations for Regulatory Reforms
Strengthening the regulatory framework
to ensure consistency and reduce corruption is very important.
Publicly funded services, public-private partnerships, and civil society initiatives
must complement private investment to ensure equitable access.
In a country where high-cost private services are often unaffordable, such collaborations can bridge the gap between demand and supply.
There is a need to develop and enforce uniform standards
for ambulance equipment, staffing, and operations across the country to ensure consistent service quality.
The government should create a centralised regulatory authority
to oversee licensing, compliance, and monitoring, reducing bureaucratic hurdles and inconsistencies.
A mechanism to implement systems for real-time tracking of ambulances
, performance audits, and grievance redressal to improve accountability and transparency is essential.
Authorities should work with urban planners to design traffic systems
that prioritise the movement of emergency vehicles, such as dedicated ambulance lanes and smart traffic signals.
To regulate private operators, the government can introduce price caps, quality benchmarks, and ethical guidelines
for private ambulance services to prevent exploitation and ensure fairness.
Conclusion
The demand for efficient and modern ambulance services in India is poised to grow
, driven by factors such as increasing health emergencies and the need for elder care.
While the sector offers promising opportunities for private investment,
a balance must be struck to ensure affordability and accessibility.
With strategic planning, regulatory reform,
and investment in infrastructure and human resources,
ambulance services can evolve into a robust pillar of India’s healthcare system
, saving countless lives in the process.

**********Southern California wildfires 2025
Why in news?
Wildfires in Los Angeles, California, have killed 10 people, forced over 130,000 evacuations, and destroyed homes, including those of celebrities like Paris Hilton and Billy Crystal.
Major fires, such as the Palisades, Eaton, Sunset, Hurst, and Lidia fires, continue to burn, affecting areas like Hollywood Hills.
The Oscars nominations announcement has been delayed due to the fires. Although wildfires are common in California, the intensity and speed of these winter wildfires are unusual.
What’s in today’s article?
California Wildfires 2025
Possible Cause of California Wildfires
What are Santa Ana Winds?
Origin and Timeline
The first fire started on January 7 in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angeles.
It is the worst firestorm in recent memory, occurring unusually in January, traditionally the coldest winter month.
Unusual Timing and Drought Conditions
Wildfires typically occur between June and October, but the current blaze defies this pattern.
Southern California has been facing drought conditions, with only 40.9% of the state drought-free as of December 31, 2024, compared to 96.65% the previous year.
The exact trigger remains unknown, but power cables blowing in the wind are a likely cause.
Three Key Factors Behind the Conflagration
Wet Weather Followed by Extreme Dryness
Unusually wet winters in 2022 and 2023 led to dense vegetation growth in the Los Angeles region.
The winter of 2024-25 has been exceptionally dry, turning the vegetation into dry kindling.
NASA Report
: Since October, Southern California has had negligible rainfall, with Los Angeles recording its driest start to a water year since 1944.
Common in the region but unusually strong this year. These winds:
Blow westward from high-pressure systems in the Great Basin.
Lose humidity, gain heat, and increase in speed as they descend over mountains.
Result: Fast, dry, and warm winds that rapidly spread flames over dry vegetation, power cables, and flammable wooden structures.
Impact of Climate Change
Climate change has intensified extreme weather events, including wildfires.
Key Observations
Rising global temperatures, warmer springs, and early snow melts have extended and intensified dry seasons, increasing vegetation moisture stress.
About
These are strong, dry, and warm winds that blow from the inland deserts of Southern California toward the coast.
These winds are most common in the fall and winter months but can occur any time of the year.
They are known for their ability to quickly spread wildfires due to their dry and powerful nature.
Causes of Santa Ana Winds
High-Pressure Systems in the Great Basin
Santa Ana winds are caused by high-pressure systems that develop over the
, a desert region that spans parts of Nevada, Utah, and California.
These high-pressure systems
create a clockwise circulation of air
, pushing winds toward lower-pressure areas along the California coast.
Descending Air
As the winds move westward, they descend from higher elevations (like the Sierra Nevada and Santa Ana Mountains) toward lower elevations near the coast.
During this descent: The air compresses, heats up, and loses humidity.
Narrow Passages and Speed Increase
The winds are funnelled through mountain passes and canyons, which increase their speed significantly.
Gusts can reach over
100 mph (160 km/h)
in some areas.
Characteristics of Santa Ana Winds
Warm and Dry
: The air warms as it descends, making the winds hot and dry.
Strong Gusts
: The winds can reach extreme speeds, causing power outages and property damage.
Fuel for Wildfires
: The dryness and speed help spread flames rapidly by drying out vegetation.

**********Meta’s new move: Community Notes
Why in news?
Meta has announced the end of its independent fact-checking program in the US, sparking criticism and debate about tackling misinformation on social media.
In a blog post titled "More Speech, Fewer Mistakes", the company outlined changes to its content moderation strategy, replacing fact-checks by fact-checkers with a
Community Notes system
, similar to X (formerly Twitter).
This shift impacts content moderation across Meta's platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads.
What’s in today’s article?
Meta’s Fact-Checking Initiative: A Brief History
What Are Community Notes?
Nine years ago, Meta introduced its independent fact-checking program to combat fake news, later expanding it after reports of Russian disinformation campaigns targeting American voters during the 2016 US presidential election.
Fact-checkers certified by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) reviewed and rated potential misinformation using original reportage, primary sources, public data, and media analyses.
How the Program Worked
Content rated false by IFCN-certified fact-checkers was made less visible to users.
A warning label linking to the fact-checker’s article was added below such content to inform users.
Meta’s Shift in Strategy
Meta has now decided to discontinue this approach, criticizing the fact-checking system for being flawed.
The company argued that fact-checkers, like everyone else, have biases that influenced their choices about what and how to fact-check.
IFCN’s Response to Meta’s Criticism
The IFCN rejected Meta's claims, asserting that its fact-checkers adhere to a Code of Principles ensuring non-partisanship and transparency.
Political Pressure and Criticism of Meta’s Decision
Experts accused Meta of abandoning fact-checkers under political pressure, especially with US President-elect Donald Trump’s criticism of big tech for allegedly censoring conservatives.
Meta’s decision has faced backlash, with concerns about its implications for combating misinformation.
About
Originally launched as Birdwatch in 2021 on X (formerly Twitter) and expanded under Elon Musk, Community Notes allow users to rate and add context to posts flagged as misleading, missing context, or requiring explanation.
Notes include reasoning, source links, and a “Readers added context” tag below the post.
Other users can vote on whether the added context should remain or be removed.
How Community Notes Work on X
A Crowdsourced Fact-Checking Model
The Community Notes model allows users to add context and facts below posts, visible only if enough contributors vote the notes as helpful.
The system improves with increased user participation and diverse perspectives.
Contributor Requirements and Process
To become a contributor on X, users must have a six-month-old account, a verified phone number, and no rule violations.
Initially, contributors rate existing notes as helpful or not and later gain the ability to write their own notes, which are rated by others.
Transparency and Accessibility
All Community Notes contributions on X are publicly available for download, enabling trend analysis and issue flagging.
Meta Adopts a Similar Model
Meta’s Community Notes system, launched on January 7 across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, is expected to function similarly to X's model.
It requires agreement between contributors with diverse viewpoints to minimize bias. Users in the US can now sign up to contribute.
Challenges with Community Notes
Vulnerability to Manipulation
Community Notes, being crowdsourced, are susceptible to coordinated manipulation.
To mitigate this, X uses a bridging algorithm that displays a note only if it is rated as helpful by users who have disagreed in their past ratings, preventing mass voting by single groups.
Ensuring Diverse Perspectives
X proactively invites contributors with differing viewpoints via a ‘Needs Your Help’ tab to ensure diverse perspectives are represented in the ratings.
Contributor Protections
X assigns auto-generated aliases to prevent identification and targeting.
Contributors who frequently write low-quality or unhelpful notes are temporarily restricted from adding new ones.
Limitations of Community Notes
Despite these safeguards, challenges persist. Community Notes are less effective in curbing misinformation that spreads to other platforms.
Additionally, their ability to capture the nuance required for fact-checking complex political news has been questioned.

Articles 148-151 of the Constitution
and the
CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971
, is the supreme audit institution of India.
Appointed by the President, the CAG's primary duties include:
Auditing the accounts of the Union and State governments, including public sector undertakings (PSUs).
Reviewing compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations through
compliance audits
Assessing the implementation and effectiveness of government schemes and projects via
performance audits
Certifying the financial accounts of governments and PSUs through
financial audits
Additionally, the
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003
, mandates the CAG to review government compliance with fiscal targets.
Selection and Execution of Audits:
The CAG follows a meticulous process to select audit subjects:
Risk Assessment
: Factors like project size, media coverage, and inspection reports influence the selection.
International Guidelines
: The CAG adheres to standards set by the
International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI)
Audit Plan Approval
: The CAG’s office drafts an annual plan, with input from an
Audit Advisory Board
, which meets biannually.
Government or Judicial Recommendations
: Specific audits may be requested by courts or governments, such as the Supreme Court’s directive for auditing the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) Flyover project.
The audit process begins with an
entry conference
with the concerned department to outline the scope and methodology. After the audit, an
exit conference
is held to share preliminary findings.
Departments are given six weeks to respond to the draft report before it is finalized and submitted to the President or Governor.
Challenges in Tabling Reports:
While
Article 151 of the Constitution mandates that CAG reports be laid before Parliament or state legislatures
, it does not specify a time limit.
This loophole has led to delays, as seen in Delhi, where over a dozen CAG reports—including on issues like air pollution mitigation and liquor supply—remain untabled. Similar delays have been observed in states like West Bengal.
A CAG report becomes public only when presented in the legislature. Following this, the
Public Accounts Committee (PAC)
examines the report, seeks government responses, and recommends corrective actions.
Between 2019 and 2023, the PAC submitted 152 reports to the Lok Sabha, scrutinizing audit findings and government compliance.
Impact of CAG Audits:
CAG reports play a pivotal role in highlighting financial losses and procedural inefficiencies, often prompting significant policy changes. For instance:
2010 audit on 2G spectrum allocation
exposed massive irregularities, leading to widespread political ramifications and regulatory reforms.
A CAG review led to changes in Telangana’s
Engineering Procurement Contract (EPC)
In 2022-23, the CAG approved
172 audit reports
, a significant increase from
73 reports in 2018-19
, reflecting its growing scrutiny of governance and fiscal accountability.
Conclusion:
The CAG’s audits are instrumental in ensuring transparency and accountability in governance.
However, the lack of timely tabling of its reports undermines its potential impact.
Strengthening mechanisms to expedite the legislative review process, coupled with robust government responses, can enhance the effectiveness of this constitutional body.
As the guardian of public finances, the CAG remains a cornerstone of India’s democratic framework, with its work extending far beyond political disputes to safeguard the interests of citizens.

**********Revised Appointment Process for Chief Election Commissioner
Why in News?
For the first time, the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) will move beyond the traditional seniority-based approach.
The Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023
has introduced new mechanisms to widen the scope of selection.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background in which the New Law to Appoint CEC and ECs Introduced
New Appointment Process Under the Act
Implications of the Key Provisions of the Act
Concerns Regarding Key Provisions of the Act
Conclusion
Background in which the New Law to Appoint CEC and ECs Introduced:
Article 324
of the Indian Constitution specifies that while the CEC and ECs will be appointed by the President, this is subject to Parliamentary law (if such law exists).
While this provision
places an expectation on Parliament
to draft a relevant law, it had not done so up until now.
In the absence of such a law,
the President has been making appointments as per the recommendations of the Prime Minister.
In 2023,
the Constitution Bench of the SC (in the
Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India
case) decided to change the process for Election Commission appointments
in order to secure their independence
The Bench created a committee
comprising the PM, the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, and the Chief Justice of India (CJI).
This committee will make recommendations
and advise the President on Election Commission appointments
until Parliament enacts a separate law on the subject
Thus, the new law has been brought in consonance with the direction of the SC with regard to the appointment of CEC and ECs.
Structure of the Election Commission:
The Election Commission includes the CEC and two Election Commissioners, currently Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu.
Eligibility criteria:
Section 5 restricts eligibility to current or former Secretary-level officers.
Departure from tradition:
Previously, the senior-most Election Commissioner succeeded the outgoing CEC.
The Act allows the selection of candidates
outside the Election Commission
, broadening the pool.
Search committee formation:
Section 6 of the Act mandates a Search Committee,
chaired by the Minister of Law and Justice
, with two senior officials, to prepare a panel of five names.
The committee's recommendations are submitted to a Selection Committee.
Selection committee composition:
The Selection Committee includes the
Prime Minister, a Cabinet minister, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
This committee can choose from the panel or nominate an external candidate.
Implications of the Key Provisions of the Act:
Government’s leeway:
The Act allows the government flexibility in choosing the CEC amidst increasing scrutiny of the Election Commission.
Debate likely:
The Election Commission continues to face criticism from Opposition parties on issues like electoral rolls and electronic voting machines (EVMs).
With the Leader of the Opposition on the panel, a debate over who is next is not ruled out.
Concerns Regarding Key Provisions of the Act:
Exclusion of CJI:
The Act responds to the SC’s 2023 ruling, which
criticized the Executive's exclusive control over appointments.
Until Parliament enacted this law, appointments were advised by a committee including the CJI.
The new Act omits the CJI from the Selection Committee
, raising concerns about the potential erosion of institutional credibility.
Potential for partisanship:
Experts highlighted the risk of the system being influenced by political changes and decisions of previous governments.
Legal challenges:
Petitions challenging the exclusion of the CJI are pending in the SC, which will hear them in February 2025.
Conclusion:
marks a significant shift in the selection process for the Election Commission.
While it aims to enhance transparency and inclusivity, concerns about credibility and Executive overreach remain under scrutiny.
The SC’s upcoming review will be pivotal in determining the future of this framework.

**********Why the sex ratio in Haryana dropped to an eight-year low in 2024?
Indian Society
Why in the News?
The sex ratio at birth in Haryana, which reached a peak of 923 in 2019, declined to 910 in 2024, marking an eight-year low.
What is the present sex ratio in India?
As of January 2025, the sex ratio at birth in India is approximately 933 females per 1,000 males.
World Bank
Why Historically has there been an Imbalance in the Sex Ratio in India?
Historically, India has faced a skewed sex ratio primarily due to cultural preferences for male children, leading to practices such as female foeticide. The sex ratio was recorded at 943 females per 1,000 males during the 2011 Census.
Factors contributing to this imbalance include:
Cultural Preference for Sons:
Societal norms often favour male children, viewing them as economic assets while daughters are seen as financial burdens due to dowry practices.
Female Foeticide:
The availability of prenatal sex determination technologies has led to sex-selective abortions, contributing to the skewed ratio.
Economic Factors:
Families may prefer fewer children and opt for sons to secure lineage and support in old age.
What are the Government Initiatives to Improve the Sex Ratio?
The Indian government has implemented several initiatives aimed at improving the sex ratio:
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Campaign:
Launched in 2015, this campaign focuses on preventing female foeticide and promoting the welfare of girls.
Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PNDT Act):
Enforced to curb sex-selective abortions and promote gender equality.
Financial Incentives:
Programs such as providing financial assistance at the birth of a girl child (e.g., Rs 21,000) encourage families to value daughters.
Education and Awareness Programs:
Efforts are made to improve female education and reduce dropout rates among girls, which are crucial for long-term improvements in gender equality.
Way forward:
Strengthen Law Enforcement and Monitoring:
Ensure strict implementation of the PCPNDT Act with increased vigilance and swift action against violations.
Address Cultural and Economic Barriers:
Launch targeted campaigns to challenge patriarchal norms, promote gender equality, and incentivise families to raise daughters.
