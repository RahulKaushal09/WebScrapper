NEW COASTAL ZONE PLAN OF KERALA
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
Context:
The Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has approved the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMPs) of 10 coastal districts of Kerala.
Background: –
The plan, prepared in tune with the provisions of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2019, permits the coastal districts to take advantage of the relaxed Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules and initiate development activities including construction of buildings towards the seaward side.
Key takeaways
A Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) is a framework designed to regulate and manage activities within coastal areas to balance environmental conservation with sustainable development.
In India, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) issued the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification in 2019, which mandates the preparation of CZMPs by coastal states and Union Territories.
Key Objectives of CZMPs:
Environmental Conservation: Protect ecologically sensitive areas such as mangroves, coral reefs, and wildlife habitats.
Sustainable Development: Promote development activities that do not compromise the health of coastal ecosystems.
Livelihood Security: Safeguard the interests and traditional rights of coastal communities, including fisherfolk.
Components of a CZMP:
Demarcation of Coastal Zones: Identification and classification of coastal areas into different zones (e.g., CRZ-I, CRZ-II, CRZ-III, CRZ-IV).
Regulatory Measures: Establishment of guidelines and restrictions for permissible activities within each zone to prevent environmental degradation.
Management Strategies: Development of plans for pollution control, disaster management, and conservation of coastal and marine resources.
What does it mean for Kerala?
Kerala has a coastline of around 590 km and nine of its 14 districts are located on the coast of the Arabian Sea.
The 2011 Census put the population density of Kerala at 859 persons per square kilometre, which is more than double the national average of 382 people per square kilometre. The coastal areas of the State are marked by a high density of population when compared to other parts of the State.
The high demographic pressure on land had resulted in rampant violations of the CRZ rules along the coast. The focus of the CRZ 2011 regime, which was in force till the approval of the CZMP, was on the conservation of the coastal ecosystem, which in turn protected the livelihood of millions of fishers and coastal communities.
What are the benefits?
The approval of the CZMP would directly benefit around 10 lakh people, according to an estimation of the State government as the earlier restrictions for the construction of new houses and repair of existing homes will be relaxed.
The new regime will see the No Development Zone (NDZ) — the area which has to be left untouched — around the tidal-influenced water bodies reduced.
For instance, the decision will see 37 village panchayats categorised as CRZ-III A, where the NDZ has been reduced to one-fourth of the earlier regime. The CRZ-III A are densely populated rural areas with a population density of 2,161 per square kilometre as per the 2011 Census. The NDZ in the category is 50 meters from the High Tide Line against 200 meters as specified by CRZ 2011 notification.
What about mangroves?
Vast tracts of mangrove vegetation would be exposed to exploitation as the 2019 notification has limited the legal protection of government holdings of an extent over 1,000 sq. metre to 50-metre buffer zones.
The new regime has also taken away the mandatory buffer zone around mangrove vegetation located in private holdings.

NOT ALL PRIVATE PROPERTY CAN BE TAKEN OVER BY STATE
: In a landmark ruling that has implications on the citizen’s right to hold property, a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled that not all private property can be deemed “material resource of the community” for redistribution under Article 39(b) of the Constitution.
Falling under Part IV of the Constitution titled “Directive Principles of State Policy” (DPSP), Article 39(b) places an obligation on the state to create policy towards securing “the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good”.
The ruling in the constitutional reference essentially undoes several decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence on the issue.
A line of judgments holding that both public and private resources fell within the ambit of “material resources of the community” under Article 39(b) stem from a minority opinion by Justice V R Krishna Iyer in State of Karnataka v Shri Ranganatha Reddy (1977).
A 1982 five-judge constitution bench ruling in the case Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company vs Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, had affirmed Justice Iyer’s view.
The majority opinion of the SC has now disagreed with these judgments. It said Justice Iyer “cast the net wide, holding that all resources which meet material needs are covered by the phrase, and any attempts by the government to nationalize these resources would be within the scope of Article 39(b)”.
SC added, “In essence, the interpretation of Article 39(b) adopted in these judgments is rooted in a particular economic ideology and the belief that an economic structure which prioritises the acquisition of private property by the state is beneficial for the nation.”
As per the recent judgement, the text of the provision indicates that not all privately owned resources fall within the ambit of the place. However, privately owned resources are not excluded as a class, and some private resources may be covered.
The court added that the Ranganath Reddy and Sanjeev Coke judgments “are incorrect to the extent that they hold that all resources of an individual are part of the community, and thus all private property is covered by the phrase material resources of the community”.
The majority view also cited B R Ambedkar’s view that “if the Constitution laid down a particular form of economic and social organisation, it would amount to taking away the liberty of people to decide the social organisation in which they wish to live”. Citing this, the ruling framed the court’s role “not to lay down economic policy, but to facilitate this intent of the framers to lay down the foundation for an ‘economic democracy’.”
The SC added: “Indeed, it is this spirit and its all-encompassing nature of the constitution, which has allowed elected governments since independence to pursue economic reforms and policies based on domestic conditions, international requirements, and political exigencies of the time”.
The majority opinion referred to India’s economic growth trajectory — the mixed economy of the 1950-60s that included heavy industries and import substitution; the shift towards purportedly “socialist reforms” in the late 1960s and 90s, followed by “market-based reforms” in the 1990s or the “liberalisation years”.
The court said that as participants in a vibrant, multiparty economic democracy, the people of India have voted to power governments which have adopted varied economic and social policies based on the country’s evolving development strategies and challenges.

CHALO INDIA CAMPAIGN
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
The Ministry of Tourism will launch its Chalo India campaign on the sidelines of the ongoing World Travel Mart in London.
The foreign tourist footfall to India has been severely hit in the wake of the pandemic and numbers haven’t returned to pre-pandemic levels. Around 6.19 million and 1.52 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2022 and 2021 respectively, compared to 10.93 million in 2019.
The Ministry of Tourism is participating at WTM London, to showcase India’s vibrant cultural diversity and the vast range of tourism products and immersive experiences.
About Chalo India Campaign
Chalo India is a first-of-its-kind initiative to bring more foreign tourists to India, wherein the government will allow “friends” of diaspora members to get free visas.
Five foreign nationals nominated by each Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholder on a special portal will be eligible for a gratis e-visa (visa granted without fees).
As the special portal goes live, the OCI cardholders will need to register on the same and key in the details of their nominated friends; they will be assigned a unique code after due verification. The designated friends can then use the special code to avail of a free visa.
There are about five million OCI card holders, as per government records. While each OCI holder can nominate up to five people, the total number of free e-visas to be granted under the said initiative is one lakh, officials said.
The UK is the third largest source market for inbound tourists to India. At almost 1.9 million, it also has one of the biggest Indian diaspora.
**********
POSITIVE SECULARISM
The Supreme Court in Anjum Qadri and Anr vs Union of India & Ors upheld the constitutionality of the UP Madarsa Act, 2004.
The Allahabad High Court had declared the UP Madarsa Education Board Act “unconstitutional” on March 22 this year
The SC did not agree with the High Court’s decision to strike down the Madarsa Act based on secularism as part of the Basic Structure.
Citing its Indira Nehru Gandhi judgment (1975), the SC categorically held that the doctrine of Basic Structure should be invoked to examine the validity of a constitutional amendment, not an ordinary piece of legislation like the UP Madarsa Act.
The current judgment authored by CJI Chandrachud held that in testing an ordinary law, courts should look just at legislative competence and consistency with fundamental rights. The judgment, accordingly, observed that an ordinary law cannot be declared unconstitutional for violating the basic structure of the Constitution because concepts such as democracy, federalism and secularism are undefined, and permitting courts to strike down legislation for their violation of such concepts will introduce an element of uncertainty in adjudication.
Since the Madarsa Act was struck down in the name of secularism, the judgment discussed the concept at length. It relied on the nine-judge bench judgment in S R Bommai v. Union of India (1994), which had held that “secularism is a positive concept of equal treatment of all religions”.
The SC said in its present verdict that Articles 25 to 30 contain the other facet of secularism, that is, the practice of religious tolerance by the state. It observed that “by recognising and regulating the Madarsa education, the state legislature is taking positive action to safeguard the educational rights of the minorities.”
The judgment also said, in essence, that secularism is a facet of equality. It rightly observed that substantive equality shall remain an illusion unless the state is positively charged with the duty to provide equal treatment to all persons, irrespective of their religion, faith, or beliefs.
The Court recalled its leading judgments on Article 30 to explain the extent of state control of minority institutions in the name of regulation. It clarified that the minority character of an institution cannot be annihilated or destroyed. Certainly, minorities do not have a right to aid and affiliation or recognition of degrees. However, at the same time, neither aid nor affiliation nor recognition by the state can come with such conditions that would destroy an institution’s minority character.
Madarsas are entitled to state protection under Article 26, which gives religious denominations or any section thereof the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes. Thus, purely religious institutions can legitimately be established and maintained.

**********India-US Ties under Trump as US President
Why in News?
As Donald Trump has gained the votes required to become the U.S.’s 47th President, we will try to analyse India-US ties during Trump 1.0 and what Trump 2.0 means for India.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Trump's First Term - Strengthening Indo-US Strategic Ties
Trump's First Term - Issues in the India-US Ties
Trump's Return and its Impact on India-US Relations
Conclusion
Trump's First Term - Strengthening Indo-US Strategic Ties:
Overview:
During Donald Trump’s presidency (2017-2021), the United States and India
transitioned from strategic partners to indispensable allies
This period saw
unprecedented cooperation in defence, counter-terrorism, and energy
but also presented certain challenges, particularly around trade and immigration.
Enhanced cooperation in defence, terrorism, and energy:
High-level diplomatic engagement:
PM Narendra Modi's 2017 White House visit set the tone for close diplomatic ties, culminating in Trump's historic visit to India in 2020.
Counter-terrorism support:
The US firmly supported India’s stance on terrorism, including backing the designation of
Jaish-e-Mohammad chief, Masood Azhar,
as a global terrorist and advocating Pakistan's grey-listing by the FATF.
Defence technology and trade:
Under Trump,
India’s defence imports from the US reached $18 billion
, and India gained access to advanced American defence technology, strengthening military capabilities and diversifying defence procurement.
Strategic energy partnership:
The 2018 Strategic Energy Partnership facilitated India’s import of American crude and LNG,
making the US India’s sixth largest source of hydrocarbon imports.
Confronting China as a common strategic rival:
Trump’s policies framed China as a
mutual threat
, enhancing Indo-US alignment in strategic goals.
His administration
revived the Quad alliance
and promoted the
Indo-Pacific strategy
to counter China's growing influence.
Trump's First Term - Issues in the India-US Ties:
Energy restrictions:
Trump pressured India to
halt oil imports from Iran
, marking a stark shift in India's energy sourcing strategy.
Trade and tariffs:
Trade disputes arose as Trump demanded
lower tariffs,
notably on Harley Davidson motorcycles, reflecting his broader stance on a fairer trade balance.
Immigration policy:
The Trump administration’s restrictive immigration stance, including limits on
H1-B visas
, strained the relationship due to India’s reliance on skilled migration to the US.
Kashmir mediation controversy:
Trump’s offer to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir sparked backlash in India, as it went against India’s stance on third-party involvement in the issue.
Trump's Return and its Impact on India-US Relations:
With Donald Trump set to re-enter the White House,
India anticipates both benefits and challenges
in the upcoming phase of bilateral relations.
Building on Trump’s earlier tenure, New Delhi expects
continuity in defence, energy cooperation, and strategic ties
, alongside possible
friction in trade and sensitive diplomatic interactions.
Opportunities for stronger India-US ties under Trump:
Reviving trade and defence deals:
Trump has expressed interest in resuming the Free Trade Agreement talks.
Expanded U.S. military hardware sales could further bolster India’s defence capabilities.
Focus on energy independence:
As seen with the earlier MoU for the Driftwood LNG plant, potentially reviving investments and boosting India's energy security.
Less pressure on domestic issues:
Compared to the Biden administration, issues like press freedoms, treatment of NGOs, and human rights may see less scrutiny under Trump, easing diplomatic tensions.
Stance on regional issues:
Trump’s stance of cancelling the majority of U.S. funding to
during his last term is likely to continue.
Also, crackdown on
Khalistani
organisations is anticipated during Trump 2.0.
Potential areas of friction:
Trump’s tariff policy:
Trump's focus on reducing trade tariffs might reignite disputes over India’s tariffs, straining the economic partnership.
Diplomatic mis-steps:
For instance, Trump’s previous remarks on Kashmir mediation and India’s conflict with China were met with strong denials from New Delhi.
Unpredictable sanctions on oil imports:
Under Trump, India faced pressure to cut off oil imports from
Iran and Venezuela
, risking its energy stability.
Similar policies could emerge, impacting India’s energy policy and regional diplomacy.
Conclusion:
Trump’s first term reshaped Indo-US relations and India anticipates both opportunities and obstacles with Trump’s return to the presidency.
Shifting regional dynamics will require careful navigation to maintain a balanced and productive partnership.

**********Anti-terror conference 2024
Why in news?
A two-day anti-terror conference 2024 in New Delhi will be inaugurated by the Union Home Minister. The event, hosted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), aims to shape future counter-terrorism policies and strategies.
NIA has outlined major issues for an upcoming two-day anti-terror conference in New Delhi, including the
role of organized crime in terror funding
in northeast India, the use of encrypted apps, connections between organized criminal gangs and terrorism, and the regulation of social media in terror cases.
These topics will be discussed with intelligence agency heads and state counter-terrorism squads.
What’s in today’s article?
Organised Crime and Terror Funding
About Organised Crime
Organized crime refers to criminal enterprises that are systematically structured to engage in illegal activities for profit.
These criminal groups often operate with a high level of coordination, secrecy, and persistence, using violence and corruption to exert control over their operations.
In India, organized crime includes activities such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, human trafficking, extortion, and illegal mining.
Symbiosis between Organized Crime and Terrorism
Organized crime has developed a symbiotic relationship with terrorist groups. This collaboration allows both entities to thrive.
Terrorist organizations, such as those active in the region, often rely on the financial support provided by organized criminal gangs.
These groups, in turn, benefit from the protection and resources offered by the terrorist organizations.
This partnership helps sustain their operations, often in remote areas where the government has limited reach.
Role of Organized Crime in Terror Funding
Organized crime and terrorism are linked in several ways, including:
Illegal activities -
Terrorist groups can fund their activities through illegal activities like: Drug trafficking; Human trafficking; Weapons trafficking; Extortion; Smuggling; Kidnapping for ransom.
Legal sources -
Terrorist groups can also fund their activities through legal sources like: Donations from wealthy benefactors; Front organizations; Business activities.
Money laundering -
Criminals can use the financial system to support terrorism through: The formal financial system; New payment methods like bitcoin and Ripple; Traditional methods of value transfer like hawala; Trade based money-laundering; Cash couriers.
Case Example: Northeast India
In the northeastern states of India, particularly in Manipur, Nagaland, and Assam, insurgent groups have had long-standing ties with organized crime.
For instance, groups like the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) have been known to engage in extortion from businesses, smuggling of arms and drugs, and even running illegal taxation operations.
These activities have helped them finance their operations and sustain insurgency movements.
In recent years, the NIA and intelligence agencies have reported the increasing involvement of organized crime in financing terrorism.
The rise of criminal syndicates engaging in cross-border smuggling, coupled with the proliferation of firearms, has exacerbated the security situation in these regions.
The use of drones to drop drugs and arms across the India-Myanmar border has also become a significant concern.
The two-day anti-terror conference, organized by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), will address several critical issues, including:
Terrorist Group Formation and Criminal Linkages
A focus on preventing the formation of new terrorist groups through a "ruthless" approach, as directed by Union Home Minister.
Discussion of organized crime's role in terror funding, especially in northeast India.
The rise of Hizb-ut-Tahrir (HuT) in southern states and transnational crime syndicates’ links to terrorism.
Case Studies and Emerging Threats
Detailed discussion of the
Rameshwaram cafe blast
, including the arrest of the accused through coordination between West Bengal police and the NIA.
Examination of new methods for arms and drug trafficking across borders using drones.
Counter-Terrorism Coordination and Strategy
Importance of a uniform anti-terror structure, with better coordination between counter-terrorism squads and local police at the district level.
Strategy to tackle terror financing and dismantle the terror ecosystem in areas affected by Left Wing Extremism.
Technological Challenges in Terrorism
The role of social media and encrypted applications in terrorism, including the use of VPNs, virtual numbers, and encrypted apps by terror groups.
The impact of narcotics trafficking on national security.
National Databases for Counter-Terrorism
Use of the NIA’s national-level terror database, which includes data on fingerprint records, terrorist cases, narco-offenders, and human trafficking offenders, to aid in investigations.

**********What Trumponomics means for India
Why in news?
Donald Trump’s proposed economic plans include a 20% tariff on all imports, over 200% duty on cars, mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, and extended tax cuts despite a record-high budget deficit. While these measures may challenge the US economy, they are seen as positive for American stocks and the Dollar, though they raise concerns for US treasuries given the risk of fiscal profligacy.
For India
, these moves could disrupt global supply chains, increase trade wars and tariff barriers, heighten forex volatility, and impact global fund flows, posing challenges for its growth.
The Federal Reserve may reconsider its rate-cut agenda in response to a changing US macroeconomic landscape, which could, in turn, influence India’s monetary policy approach, with the RBI likely taking a cautious stance on rate cuts amid uncertainties.
What’s in today’s article?
Economic Risks of Trump’s Policies: Inflation, Fiscal Deficit, and Global Market Uncertainties
Trump’s Immigration Shift and Economic Proposals: Impacts on Indian Students and IT Sector
Elon Musk’s Possible Role in US Administration: Implications for India
Impact on H-1B visa landscape
Higher tariffs and trade wars under Trump’s policies are expected to increase inflation in the US.
Combined with rising deficits and potential shifts in institutional trust, foreign lenders may reconsider their support for US Treasury debt, echoing a shift similar to the 2022 freeze of Russian assets.
The 2022 freeze of Russian assets
drove global central banks to favor physical gold over financial derivatives
Trump's
proposed tax cuts and protectionist measures
might stimulate short-term economic growth but could heighten inflation, potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to end its rate-cutting cycle prematurely.
This shift could impact global monetary policies, with institutions like India’s RBI possibly delaying rate cuts to manage financial stability amidst bond and forex market volatility.
A weaker US dollar, as seen during Trump’s first term, and fiscal deficit pressures may add to inflationary risks and challenge global interest rate cycles
Trump’s mixed immigration stance includes a
plan to curb both legal and illegal immigration
, which could add inflationary pressure in a full-employment economy.
However, his recent proposal to
automatically grant green cards to foreign nationals graduating from US colleges is seen as a positive for Indian students
Economically, a weaker US dollar could benefit India by lowering import costs and supporting domestic investment.
Additionally,
Trump’s plan to cut the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% could boost budgets for US clients of Indian service providers
, enhancing demand and driving gains in Indian IT stocks.
Elon Musk's potential induction into the new administration could influence India’s policies.
New Delhi’s earlier proposal to lower import duties for Tesla fell short of Musk’s expectations, but with his strengthened influence, India may face added pressure to offer more favorable terms.
Additionally, lobbying efforts in areas like satellite spectrum allocation and space launches may intensify across key global markets, including India, as Musk’s interests expand.
Global Economic Watch: Fed Policy and China’s Stimulus Package
Two key events are expected to impact global markets. First, the Federal Reserve’s November 6-7 policy meeting will provide updated inflation insights.
Second, China’s Standing Committee is likely to approve a substantial economic stimulus package aimed at boosting land purchases, bank recapitalization, and local debt refinancing.
Analysts warn that high US tariffs on Chinese goods could reduce China’s growth by over 2 percentage points, prompting Beijing to consider even larger fiscal stimulus—potentially reaching 2-3% of GDP annually.
This could divert foreign portfolio investment away from other markets, including India.
Overview of the H-1B Visa Program
Purpose and Eligibility
The H-1B program allows American employers to hire foreign professionals in specialty occupations requiring specialized skills and at least a bachelor’s degree.
The program’s intent is to fill skill gaps in the US workforce by authorizing temporary employment for qualified individuals.
Annual Visa Caps and Exemptions
The H-1B visa cap is set at 65,000 new visas per fiscal year, with an additional 20,000 visas for individuals with a US Master’s degree or higher.
Certain employers, like higher education institutions, non-profits, and government research organizations, are exempt from this cap.
Indian Nationals’ Dominance in H-1B Visas
In fiscal year 2023, Indians made up 72.3% (279,000) of total H-1B visa approvals, followed by Chinese nationals at 11.7%.
Historical H-1B Restrictions Under Trump During His First Term
Increased Scrutiny
: Visa denial rates and Requests for Evidence (RFEs) rose sharply, with denial rates reaching 30% by 2020, compared to just 3.2% under Obama.
Higher Wage Requirements
: The Trump administration attempted to raise wage floors for H-1B holders by 43-71%, though this measure was blocked in court.
Limits on Visa Numbers
: Speculation arose about further limiting visas or prioritizing those with advanced skills.
Planned Restrictions
Trump’s “America First” stance suggests potential major reforms to limit immigration and prioritize American workers.
His 2024 campaign proposed reducing H-1B visa numbers and enforcing stricter eligibility, which may impact tech giants like Amazon and Google that rely on H-1B talent.
There is potential for shorter visa durations, especially for third-party placements, increasing uncertainty for both employers and employees.
Impact on Indian Professionals
Tightened H-1B policies could reduce job prospects for Indian professionals in the US tech sector and complicate family reunifications for current visa holders.

**********Why the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the UP Madarsa Act, 2004?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Indian education system;
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004 (Madarsa Act), except for the provisions related to higher education.
What were the grounds for the SCt’s decision to uphold the UP Madarsa Act?
Applicability of Basic Structure Doctrine:
The Supreme Court clarified that the basic structure doctrine, which is typically applied to constitutional amendments,
does not apply to ordinary legislation
like the Madarsa Act.
The court emphasized that a law can only be struck down for violating fundamental rights or legislative competence, not for infringing on the basic structure of the Constitution.
State Regulation of Education:
The court affirmed that states have the authority to regulate educational institutions, including madrasas, as long as such regulations are reasonable and do not infringe on minority rights.
Right to Education:
The Supreme Court referenced its previous rulings regarding minority institutions’ rights to provide religious education while managing their administration.
It concluded that the Madrasa Act does not violate the
right to free and compulsory education under Article 21A
, as it allows madrasas to offer religious instruction alongside secular education.

provides a legal framework for the operation and regulation of madrasas in the state.
It aims to standardize education in these institutions by integrating both religious and secular curricula, primarily following the
National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
guidelines.
The Act established the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education, which is responsible for preparing course materials, conducting examinations, and overseeing educational standards from the ‘Maulvi’ level (equivalent to Class 10) to ‘Fazil’ (equivalent to a Master’s degree).
How does this ruling affect the regulation of madrasa education and its alignment with secular principles?
Regulation of Madarsa Education
: The ruling empowers the state to regulate madarsa education, ensuring that it meets certain standards without compromising its religious identity.
It ensures that madrasas can continue to provide Islamic education alongside secular subjects, but
within a structured and monitored environment
that does not undermine the state’s authority over educational standards.
Alignment with Secularism
: The SC’s judgment does not force madrasas to secularize completely. Instead, it recognizes the
coexistence of religious and secular education
within the institution’s framework, reflecting India’s constitutional commitment to religious freedom and secularism.
By upholding the law, the SC suggested that the government can promote secular education while respecting the rights of minority institutions to impart religious education.
Implications of Striking Down Higher Education Provisions:
Conflict with the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act
: The SC struck down provisions that allowed the Madarsa Board to grant higher education degrees (such as Kamil and Fazil), ruling that such powers conflicted with the UGC Act, which reserves the authority to grant degrees to universities recognized under central or state law.
This decision limits Madarsas’ ability to independently issue degrees for advanced religious education.
Impact on Madarsa Students
: Students seeking degrees like Kamil (bachelor’s equivalent) or Fazil (master’s equivalent) from Madarsas will
no longer receive these credentials
through the Madarsa Board.
This may affect the formal recognition of madrasa graduates, limiting their ability to pursue higher education or professional opportunities that require university-recognized degrees.
Alignment with National Educational Standards
: The SC’s decision brings madrasas in line with the UGC Act, ensuring that degree-awarding powers are centralized within recognized institutions. This promotes uniformity and compatibility with the broader national education system.
Way forward:
Collaborate with Recognized Universities:
Madarsas can partner with recognized universities to offer degrees for advanced religious studies, ensuring compliance with the UGC Act while retaining the essence of religious education.
Integrate Secular and Religious Education Standards:
To enhance educational outcomes, the government could provide support for curriculum development in madrasas, balancing religious teachings with secular subjects in alignment with national educational standards.

**********What Trump 2.0 mean for India? 
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Global Geopolitics; Regional Stability; Impact of USA election on Foreign Policy;
Why in the News?
New Delhi’s enthusiastic reception of Trump 2.0 will be moderated by apprehensions about his social media posts and harsh stance on trade and tariffs.
Trump 2.0 Impact on India-U.S. Trade Relations:
Trade Negotiations and Free Trade Agreement (FTA):
Trump is likely to pick up negotiations for an India-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA), a process that began during his first term but was shelved after his loss in 2020. This could provide opportunities for greater market access and trade partnerships.
Focus on Tariffs:
Trump’s administration has been vocal about reducing trade tariffs. This could lead to pressure on India to lower its tariffs, as it did during
Trump 1.0
when counter-tariffs were imposed, and India lost its
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status.
U.S. Military and Technology Access:
India is likely to benefit from increased access to U.S. military hardware and technology. Trump’s administration has historically supported closer defense ties with India, which could be further solidified in his second term, benefiting India’s defense capabilities.
Energy Deals and Trade:
Trump could encourage India to increase purchases of U.S. oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), as seen with previous deals like the Driftwood LNG plant. This could bolster trade, while also positioning the U.S. as a key energy partner for India.
Note:
The
is a U.S. trade program that grants duty-free access to certain goods from developing countries to promote economic growth.
Implications for India’s Foreign Policy (Russia and Iran):
Relations with Russia:
Trump’s pro-Russia stance suggests that India will face less pressure to distance itself from Moscow.
While previous U.S. administrations have criticized India’s defense ties with Russia, Trump may adopt a more pragmatic approach, focusing on other strategic aspects like defense cooperation without pressing India on Russian relations.
Iran Policy:
Trump’s previous sanctions against Iran caused India to reduce its oil imports from Iran. Under Trump 2.0, India is likely to face fewer sanctions-related pressures, as Trump has historically shown a less critical stance on countries like Iran compared to other U.S. leaders.
India could therefore maintain or revive its ties with Iran without facing significant U.S. backlash.
Challenges from Trump’s Domestic Policies (Immigration and Technology Transfer):
Immigration and H-1B Visa Policy:
Trump’s tough stance on immigration and H-1B visas could pose challenges for India, especially in terms of its highly skilled workforce.
India’s tech sector relies
heavily on H-1B visas
, and stricter immigration policies under Trump 2.0 could limit opportunities for Indian professionals to work in the U.S., affecting India’s IT and services sector.
Technology Transfer:
Trump has shown a preference for protectionist policies, which may slow down the transfer of advanced technologies to India.
This could impact India’s aspirations to become a global hub for high-tech industries, particularly in sectors like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and defence technology.
Increased Focus on U.S. Jobs:
Trump’s focus on bringing jobs back to the U.S. may result in policies that prioritize domestic industries over foreign collaborations, limiting the scope for Indian companies in certain sectors and creating trade tensions.
Way forward:
Strengthen Bilateral Trade Negotiations:
India should actively engage in FTA negotiations with the U.S., seeking mutually beneficial terms that address tariff concerns, market access, and defense collaboration, while also ensuring safeguards for sensitive sectors like technology and agriculture.
Diversify Technology and Energy Partnerships:
India can focus on diversifying its sources of technology transfer and energy imports, strengthening ties with other global players in these sectors to mitigate potential risks from Trump’s protectionist policies and ensuring sustainable growth in high-tech industries and energy security.

**********The demand for greater autonomy for Eastern Nagaland districts
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Federal Issues; Issues related to the Nagaland Government;
Why in the News?
After months of inactivity, the Nagaland government announced last week that it is now prepared to submit its feedback on the Centre’s draft Memorandum of Settlement, which proposes greater Autonomy for the state’s six eastern districts.
What are the historical and socio-economic factors driving the demand for greater autonomy in Eastern Nagaland?
Historical Background
: The six eastern districts—
Kiphire, Longleng, Mon, Noklak, Shamator,
Tuensang
—were part of an area historically set apart for special governance.
After Nagaland’s creation from Assam in 1963, these districts were administered differently due to their relative lack of infrastructure and resources.
16-Point Agreement & Article 371(A)
: Nagaland was formed with special provisions, including
Article 371(A),
to protect Naga customs and address unique challenges in the “
Tuensang region”
(now the six eastern districts).
Initially, a regional council governed these districts, reflecting an early recognition of their distinct needs.
Development Deficit
: Despite
these districts continue to face significant development challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, healthcare, and educational facilities.
This lack of development fuels the demand for separate governance, as the existing state-level administration is perceived to overlook their needs.
Note:
grants special provisions to Nagaland, protecting its cultural practices, land, resources, and customary laws from parliamentary laws.
How does the proposed ‘Frontier Nagaland Territory’ differ from existing governance structures, and what specific powers would it entail?
The “Frontier Nagaland Territory” is a unique model of autonomy within the state of Nagaland. Key points of the proposed arrangement include:
Separate Legislature, Executive, and Financial Powers
: This proposed setup would give the region greater control over local legislative decisions, executive functions, and financial resources.
Regional Council
: The regional council for Eastern Nagaland would manage local issues and is in line with the provisions of Article 371(A) but would expand these powers further.
Headquarters in East Nagaland
: Unlike current governance structures that are centered in the state capital Kohima, this arrangement suggests an independent headquarters within East Nagaland, giving local leaders more direct control over the region’s administration.
What role do local organizations like the ENPO (Eastern Nagaland People’s Organization) play in advocating for this autonomy?
Driving the Demand
: ENPO has been the primary advocate for autonomy since its 2010 memorandum to the Prime Minister’s Office. The group argues for a separate state or enhanced autonomy based on longstanding neglect and developmental disparities.
Political Leverage
: ENPO’s influence is evident in their strategic actions, such as boycotting the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections to pressure both the state and central governments. This boycotting tactic has effectively highlighted the intensity of the demand and brought national attention to the issue.
Insistence on Direct Negotiations
: ENPO maintains a strong stance on discussing autonomy only with the central government, not with the state, which underscores its dissatisfaction with the state administration’s handling of Eastern Nagaland’s interests.
How might their demands influence state and central government responses?
Central Government’s Response
: The Centre has shown some willingness to explore a
“mutually agreed solution,”
as seen in the draft Memorandum of Settlement and repeated assurances to the ENPO.
This indicates that the central government may consider some form of autonomy, though it balances this with state interests.
State Government’s Position
: The state government, which initially delayed providing input on the proposal, has now agreed to submit its comments, likely to avoid further regional dissent.
However, it is navigating a complex situation where conceding autonomy could impact its overall governance framework.
Further Deliberation and Possible Compromises
: Both the Centre and the state are expected to engage in detailed negotiations with the ENPO and other stakeholders.
The discussions will likely center on balancing the autonomy demands with the broader interests of Nagaland, seeking to avoid full separation while addressing developmental grievances.
Way forward:
Strengthen Local Governance and Infrastructure
: Need to establish a robust framework for local governance with dedicated funds and authority to address the developmental deficits in Eastern Nagaland, ensuring that the “Frontier Nagaland Territory” arrangement grants meaningful legislative, executive, and financial autonomy to meet the unique needs of the region.
Inclusive Dialogue and Regular Consultations
: Facilitate ongoing, inclusive dialogues among the Centre, state government, ENPO, and local representatives to address concerns transparently and collaboratively.

**********How Vitamin D deficiency can trigger autoimmune conditions?
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Autoimmune Conditions, Vitamin D
Why in the News?
Recent research conducted by scientists at McGill University has shed light on the critical role of vitamin D in maintaining thymus health and its implications for immune function.
About
Autoimmune Conditions:
Autoimmune conditions
refer to disorders where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own healthy tissues, viewing them as foreign.
Vitamin D plays a role in
regulating immune responses
and promoting
immune tolerance
—the body’s ability to avoid attacking its own cells.
It influences
T-cells
(a type of immune cell) to recognize and tolerate the body’s own tissues rather than attacking them.
The
thymus gland
trains T-cells to avoid attacking healthy cells. A deficiency in Vitamin D may cause the thymus to age prematurely, reducing its ability to regulate T-cells properly.
Vitamin D affects certain
genetic pathways
related to immune function.
Variations in the
vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene
may also predispose some individuals to autoimmune diseases, and these individuals might be more sensitive to Vitamin D levels.
What is Vitamin D?
Vitamin D is a
fat-soluble vitamin
crucial for the body’s ability to absorb
calcium, magnesium,
phosphate
, which are essential for
bone health
It supports
muscle movement, nerve function,
responses. Due to its synthesis in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, it is often called the
‘sunshine vitamin’
The body naturally produces Vitamin D when skin is exposed to
ultraviolet B (UVB) rays
from sunlight.
Sources of Vitamin D
Fish
: Salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines are rich in Vitamin D.
Cod liver oil
: A concentrated source, providing 400–1,000 IU per teaspoon.
Mushrooms
: Varieties like portobello contain Vitamin D if exposed to UV light.
Fortified Foods
: Milk, yogurt, orange juice, and cereals often have added Vitamin D.
Egg yolks
: Contain a small amount of Vitamin D.
Common forms include
Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)
Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
, especially useful in autumn and winter when sunlight exposure is limited.
Significance of Vitamin D
Bone Health
: Essential for
calcium absorption
, which strengthens bones and prevents
osteoporosis
Muscle and Nerve Function
: Supports
muscle contractions
nerve signaling
between the brain and body.
Immune System
: Enhances immune defenses, helping to fight off infections by
viruses and bacteria
Brain Health
: May play a role in maintaining
cognitive health
, especially with aging.
Inflammation and Pain
: Helps regulate the body’s response to
inflammation and pain
Blood Pressure
: Linked to regulating blood pressure; deficiency is associated with
hypertension
Impacts of Vitamin D Deficiency
Increases the risk of
rickets
in children (softening of bones) and
in adults.
Low levels of Vitamin D are linked to autoimmune conditions like
rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,
multiple sclerosis
Recent studies indicate that Vitamin D deficiency can
accelerate thymus aging
, leading to immune dysfunction and a higher risk of autoimmune diseases.
Deficiency has been associated with
cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression,
chronic pain
Can include
fatigue, muscle weakness, bone pain,
In severe cases, deficiency may cause
impaired bone growth
fracture susceptibility
PYQ:
[2011]
Regular intake of fresh fruits and vegetables is recommended in the diet since they are a good source of antioxidants. How do antioxidants help a person maintain health and promote longevity?
(a) They activate the enzymes necessary for vitamin synthesis in the body and help prevent vitamin deficiency.
(b) They prevent excessive oxidation of carbohydrates, fats and proteins in the body and help avoid unnecessary wastage of energy.
(c) They neutralize the free radicals produced in the body during metabolism.
(d) They activate certain genes in the cells of the body and help delay the ageing process.
