OPPOSITION SET TO SUBMIT NOTICE FOR RESOLUTION TO IMPEACH DHANKHAR
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
Context:
In an unprecedented move, about 60 Opposition MPs belonging to the INDIA bloc submitted a notice in New Delhi on Tuesday at the Rajya Sabha Secretary General P.C. Mody’s office, seeking the removal of the Chairperson of the Upper House, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar.
Background: –
Alleging that Mr. Dhankhar, since assuming the office of Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, had conducted the proceedings in an “extremely biased” manner, the Opposition members also presented a six-point “charge-sheet” against him in the notice.
Key takeaways
The Vice President of India can be removed from office through a resolution passed by Parliament under Article 67(b) of the Constitution. While often referred to as “impeachment,” the process for the Vice President’s removal is distinct from the impeachment process for the President.
Constitutional Provisions
Article 63: Establishes the office of the Vice President.
Article 64: States that the Vice President is also the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.
Article 67(b): Outlines the removal procedure of the Vice President.
Procedure for Removal
Initiation:
The removal resolution must be moved in the Rajya Sabha.
The motion must be signed by at least one-fourth of the total members of the Rajya Sabha.
Notice Period: A 14-day prior notice is required before the motion is taken up for consideration.
Special Majority:
The resolution must be passed by a majority of all members of the Rajya Sabha  whose seats are not vacant and agreed to by the Lok Sabha through a simple majority (majority of members present and voting).
Grounds for Removal
The Constitution does not specify the grounds for the removal of the Vice President. It is left to the discretion of Parliament, making the process political rather than judicial.
Comparison with Presidential Impeachment
Impeachment of the President (Article 61) involves:
Judicial Inquiry: Charges of violation of the Constitution.
Special Procedure: A more stringent process requiring two-thirds majority in both Houses.
In contrast, the removal of the Vice President is simpler and purely a parliamentary procedure.
Key Point to Note
The process has never been invoked in Indian history, reflecting the stability of the office and its largely ceremonial nature.

EXTENT OF THE GLOBAL SOLAR
Mains – ENVIRONMENT
The World Solar Report 2024 by the International Solar Alliance (ISA) was released recently.
From 1.22 GW in 2000, the world’s solar capacity has surged to 1,419 GW in 2023, charting a CAGR of about 36%. Today, solar capacity represents three-quarters of all renewable capacity additions worldwide.
What are new solar technologies?
Quantum dot solar cells have achieved a record-breaking efficiency of 18.1%. Researchers are creating self-healing solar panels to extend the lifespan and reduce the maintenance of existing solar cell technologies.
Solar-powered phyto-mining uses solar energy to power the extraction of valuable metals from soil-using plants, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional mining practices.
Solar paver blocks integrated with building infrastructure and BIPV (Building Integrated PV), like transparent solar panels, allow light transmission and visibility. The development of these alternative technologies will reduce reliance on critical materials like lithium and rare earth elements.
The solar sector is also prioritising recycling panels and implementing circular economy practices to minimise environmental impact.
Have reducing costs helped?
The 2024 World Solar Report shows that the average auction prices for utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects have consistently decreased across all regions. Utility-scale solar PV costs averaged $40/MWh in 2024.
India topped the global charts in solar PV capacity granted through auctions, securing a notable auction price of $34/MWh.
As of 2023, China dominates solar PV as 43% (609 GW) of the cumulative capacity of solar panels installed globally is from China. The U.S. contributes 10% (137.73 GW). Japan, Germany, and India each captured a 5-6% share.
Has solar impacted other industries?
Employment in the solar PV sector rose to 7.1 million jobs in 2023, up from 4.9 million in 2022 worldwide, underscoring the sector’s role in job creation and economic development.
Solar-powered irrigation systems are transforming agriculture. Agrivoltaics systems are being used in livestock management, with solar panels installed in pastures to provide shade for animals while simultaneously generating electricity.
One of the key factors driving the adoption of solar systems has been the introduction of pay-as-you-go business models, allowing users to pay for their systems in small, regular instalments.
Technological advancements have made solar energy more affordable, while new applications are further driving adoption.

**********Deepening India’s Steps as a Key Space-Faring Nation
Context
India has embarked on an ambitious journey to expand its presence in outer space
over the next two decades.
At the heart of this vision is the
development of reusable, heavy-lift rockets such as the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV).
To achieve strategic autonomy in space,
India must also leverage its private sector to develop parallel technologies,
ensuring a resilient and competitive space ecosystem.
The Evolution of India’s Space Ambitions
Early Foundations: The 1960s to 1980s
India’s initial foray
into space was
marked by modest objectives, largely focused on using space technology to address developmental challenges.
launch of Aryabhata in 1975, India’s first satellite
, symbolised the nation’s commitment to self-reliance in space technology.
Subsequent projects, such as the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) and the INSAT series,
demonstrated the practical utility of satellites for education, weather forecasting, and communication.
These efforts laid the groundwork for a robust space program
oriented toward socio-economic benefits.
The Growth Phase: The 1990s to 2000s
By the 1990s, India began to expand its capabilities
, shifting from being a technology user to a developer.
The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)
emerged as a reliable workhorse, capable of launching satellites into different orbits.
success of missions like Chandrayaan-1 in 2008, India’s first lunar probe
, marked a turning point.
Chandrayaan-1 not only confirmed the presence of water on the moon but also showcased India’s ability
to execute complex interplanetary missions.
Towards Human Spaceflight and Exploration
2010s saw India aiming higher with missions like Mangalyaan
, the Mars Orbiter Mission, launched in 2013.
This mission, accomplished at a fraction of the cost of similar global projects
, demonstrated India’s
engineering ingenuity and strategic foresight.
As the first Asian nation to reach Mars’ orbit,
India firmly established itself among the elite group
of space powers.
Gaganyaan, aimed at sending Indian astronauts into space
, this initiative reflects India’s aspirations to develop indigenous human spaceflight capabilities.
Strategic Autonomy and International Collaboration
As space increasingly becomes a domain of strategic importance,
achieving autonomy in space transportation and exploration is crucial.
At the same time,
ISRO has actively collaborated with international partners
, contributing to global projects while safeguarding its independent capabilities.
India’s evolution as a space power reflects a careful balancing act
: leveraging global cooperation while building indigenous capacity.
dual approach ensures that India remains competitive
while maintaining strategic independence.
The Promise of the NGLV
The NGLV represents a significant technological leap
for India.
It
alleviates the engineering constraints of miniaturisation
and weight reduction by accommodating larger payloads, which dramatically expands the scope of space missions.
Furthermore,
its partial reusability offers substantial cost savings
, aligning with global trends in rocket technology.
In contrast to expendable rockets,
reusable systems require a portion of their fuel for controlled descent and recovery.
While this slightly reduces payload capacity, the trade-off is justified by long-term economic benefits.
Reusability has become an industry standard, exemplified by the success of SpaceX’s reusable Falcon 9 and the groundbreaking Starship rockets.
Immediate Needs and Challenges Faced by Indian Space Sector
Limitations of Current Rockets
India’s current most powerful rocket, t
he LVM3 (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III), has a payload capacity of 4,000
kg to the Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).
This capacity, while sufficient for some missions, falls short when it comes to heavier payloads
required for advanced applications like large communication satellites or complex lunar missions.
For instance, India’s next uncrewed moon mission will require two LVM3 r
ockets to assemble the payload in space, a time-consuming and complex process.
Similarly, the GSAT-N2 satellite, which weighed 4,700 kg, had to be launched aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket
due to the LVM3’s payload limitations.
Such dependencies on foreign launch providers not only incur high costs
but also compromise strategic autonomy.
The Need for Heavy-Lift and Reusable Rockets
global space industry has rapidly transitioned to heavy-lift reusable rockets,
which provide significant cost savings and operational efficiency.
SpaceX’s Falcon 9, for example, can carry up to 5,500 kg to GTO
with reusability and 8,300 kg as an expendable rocket.
Meanwhile,
the Starship, SpaceX’s latest innovation, boasts a payload capacity exceeding 21,000 kg to GTO and 100,000 kg to Low Earth Orbit (LEO),
while remaining fully reusable.
These capabilities far surpass India’s current offerings, underscoring the need for accelerated technological upgrades.
The absence of such advanced rockets in India means that the country cannot fully participate in or benefit from the rapidly growing commercial space market
, particularly in satellite launches and deep-space missions.
Strategies Towards Bridging the Gap
Collaborations for Launch Services
In the short term,
partnering with international companies like SpaceX for critical heavy-lift launches can help India
bridge the gap.
However, this should be viewed as a stopgap measure to avoid long-term dependence.
Enhancements to Existing Rockets and Developing Reusable Technology
Incremental upgrades to the LVM3 could help improve its payload capacity.
For example,
optimising propulsion systems or adopting advanced materials might allow the rocket to handle slightly heavier payloads
, providing temporary relief until the NGLV becomes operational.
Initiatives to introduce partial reusability in current rockets, even in limited capacities, could significantly reduce costs and provide valuable experience
for future reusable systems.
Encourage Private Sector Engagement
To bridge these gaps,
India must actively involve its private sector in developing heavy-lift, reusable rockets.
Department of Space can issue contracts incentivising private companies to design and build their own rockets
, creating innovation and technical growth.
This collaborative approach can leverage milestone-based funding
to ensure accountability and manage costs effectively.
Although Indian private industry currently lacks expertise
in rocket technology, partnerships with foreign entities and the
acquisition of commercial rocket engines can accelerate progress.
The benefits of such an approach extend beyond immediate project outcomes, creating a robust ecosystem of innovation,
infrastructure, and technical capability.
Addressing High Development Costs and Safety and Reliability
Building advanced rockets requires significant investment in research
, infrastructure, and testing.
Ensuring efficient resource allocation and avoiding cost overruns is crucial.
Human-spaceflight missions and interplanetary explorations demand extremely high safety standards.
Developing reliable rockets with the ability to consistently carry heavy payloads is a time-intensive process
that involves numerous test flights and iterations.
Conclusion
India stands at the cusp of a transformative era
in its space program.
The development of reusable, heavy-lift rockets
like the NGLV,
coupled with private sector collaboration, offers the potential to position India as a global leader
in space exploration.
By addressing current challenges
and developing a resilient industrial ecosystem,
India can ensure its ambitions in outer space are not only realized but sustained for decades to come.

Editorial Analysis
**********Female Labour Force Participation Rate Rose During 2017-18 to 2022-23
What’s in Today’s Article?
About LFPR (Meaning, Paper Released by EAC-PM)
Key Findings of the Paper (Govt. Initiatives, Criticism, etc.)
What is LFPR?
According to the CMIE, the
labour force consists of persons who are of age 15 years or older
, and belong to either of the following two categories:
Employed
Unemployed and are willing to work and are actively looking for a job
There is a crucial commonality between the two categories — they both have people “demanding” jobs. This demand is what
(LFPR) refers to.
While those in category 1 succeed in getting a job, those in category 2 fail to do so.
Essentially,
LFPR is the number of people ages 15 and older who are employed or actively seeking employment, divided by the total non-institutionalized, civilian working-age population
LFPR represents the demand for jobs in an economy
On the other hand, Unemployment Rate (UER), which is routinely quoted in the news, is nothing but the number of unemployed (category 2) as a proportion of the labour force.
Paper Released by EAC-PM:
The female LFPR in India has shown remarkable improvement between 2017-18 and 2022-23, with rural areas witnessing larger gains than urban areas.
According to a working paper released by the
Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM)
, this trend highlights the growing involvement of women in the workforce, though regional disparities persist.
Key Findings:
National Trends
Rural LFPR
: Increased from 24.6% in 2017-18 to 41.5% in 2022-23, marking a 69% growth.
Urban LFPR
: Rose from 20.4% to 25.4% during the same period.
The increase remains consistent even after excluding unpaid family workers, suggesting a genuine rise in women entering the workforce.
Regional Disparities
States like Bihar, Punjab, and Haryana have consistently reported
low female LFPR
despite their contrasting economic statuses (Bihar being the poorest and Punjab and Haryana among the richest states).
North-eastern States
: Rural areas, especially in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, have seen significant improvements in LFPR.
Eastern States
: Rural Bihar had the lowest LFPR but showed notable progress in recent years, particularly among married women.
Demographic Insights
Marital Status
: Married women exhibit significantly lower LFPR compared to men, particularly in urban areas. For men, LFPR remains consistently high across age groups.
Age Distribution
: Female LFPR peaks between ages 30-40 and declines sharply thereafter, forming a bell-shaped curve. In contrast, male LFPR remains high (nearly 100%) for ages 30-50 and declines gradually.
Government Initiatives Supporting Women’s Employment:
The report highlights several government schemes aimed at empowering women and boosting female LFPR:
Mudra Loans
: Provides financial assistance to women entrepreneurs.
Drone Didi Scheme
: Focuses on skill development for women in emerging technologies like drones.
Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana
: Promotes women-led development through self-help groups.
While the initiatives have played a role in supporting women's participation in the workforce, the paper calls for more rigorous research to evaluate their long-term impact.
Criticism:
Critics have pointed out that much of the increase in female LFPR has been attributed to unpaid family work.
However, the paper counters this by emphasizing that the overall trend remains positive even when unpaid work is excluded.
The study also notes the need for future research to assess how government schemes have influenced this rise.
Conclusion:
The rise in female LFPR between 2017-18 and 2022-23 marks a significant shift in women's employment in India, particularly in rural areas.
However, challenges like regional disparities, lower participation among married women, and the need for sustainable, paid employment opportunities persist.
Policymakers must focus on targeted interventions and better implementation of women-centric schemes to ensure sustained growth in female workforce participation.

**********Judicial Ethics and Conduct
Why in News?
Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav of the Allahabad High Court has faced widespread criticism for comments made during an event organised by the legal cell of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Controversial Remarks of Allahabad HC Judge and Backlash
The Impeachment Process for Judges
Conclusion
Controversial Remarks and Backlash:
Key comments:
Justice Yadav stated that the country operates as per the wishes of the majority population in India.
He made divisive remarks comparing values taught to children of different communities, emphasising the practice of animal slaughter.
Advocated for a Uniform Civil Code (
UCC
), asserting that Hindus revere women as goddesses, in contrast to practices like polygamy and triple talaq in another community.
Response from legal and civil bodies:
Supreme Court’s reaction:
The SC noted the issue and
sought details from the Allahabad HC
, stating the matter is under consideration.

violations of judicial ethics.
Kapil Sibal, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, called for Justice Yadav’s
impeachment
Judicial Ethics and Conduct:
Standards for judicial conduct:
1985 UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary:
These principles seek to bridge the gap between ideal judicial independence and real-world practices, ensuring that -
Justice is upheld,
Human rights are preserved, and
The court acts without discrimination.
Restatement of values of judicial life (1997):
It is a code of judicial ethics (comprising 16 points) adopted by the SC. It emphasises impartiality and behaviour that reaffirms public confidence in the judiciary.
Bangalore principles of judicial conduct (2002):
The UN Economic and Social Council (
ECOSOC
) adopted a resolution to complement the 1985 UN Basic Principles.
It requires judges to act with dignity, impartiality, and independence while respecting societal diversity.
Alleged violations:

**********Centre wants states to make snakebites notifiable disease
Why in news?
The Union Health Ministry has urged states to classify snakebites as a notifiable disease, requiring both private and public hospitals to report cases.
Diseases likely to cause outbreaks, result in fatalities, or require immediate public health action are classified as notifiable. Common examples include tuberculosis, HIV, cholera, malaria, dengue, and hepatitis.
What’s in today’s article?
Snakebites in India
Why Make Snakebites Notifiable?
Challenges of treating snakebites
Statistics
Snakebites pose a significant public health challenge in India, with
3-4 million cases and an estimated 58,000 deaths annually
, according to the 2020 Indian Million Death Study.
National action plan
To address this, the government launched the
National Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Snakebite Envenoming (NAPSE)
earlier this year, aiming to halve snakebite deaths by 2030.
NAPSE recommends making snakebites a notifiable disease.
Bites of which snakes can be fatal
India has over 310 snake species, 66 venomous and 42 mildly venomous.
Of these, 23 species are medically significant,
with the majority of bites caused by the “Big Four”:
Indian cobra
Common krait
Russell’s viper
Saw-scaled viper
Commercial
polyvalent antivenom is effective against bites
from these four species and covers 80% of snakebites.
Snakebite - a ‘Disease’
Snakebites can lead to acute medical emergencies that require immediate care.
They can cause severe paralysis that can prevent breathing, can lead to a fatal hemorrhage, and damage different tissues.
Snakebites need to be treated with antivenom to prevent death and severe symptoms.
Classifying snakebites as notifiable could improve surveillance and provide precise data on cases and deaths.
This information would help allocate antivenoms and train healthcare workers in high-risk areas.
In a letter to state health secretaries, Union Health Secretary emphasized mandatory notification to strengthen snakebite surveillance and improve clinical management.
High-risk states
Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, and Gujarat
The challenges are mainly on three fronts:
Treatment
Delayed or No Healthcare Access
: Victims often do not reach healthcare centers in time or rely on faith-based healers.
Lack of Training
: Healthcare staff often lack adequate training to treat snakebites.
Testing Gaps
: Tests to confirm snakebites are unavailable.
Antivenoms
Development of the antivenom
Almost all the venom that is used to develop the antivenom in the country comes from snakes caught by the
Irula tribe
, who live in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala.
This is a major challenge, as the
biochemical constituents and the effect of the venom from the same snake species may differ based on geography
Venom potency changes with snake's age
For instance, neonatal Russell’s viper venom is more toxic than that of adults.
Other challenges related to antivenoms
Antivenoms themselves cause various reactions.
There are also local snake species — such as the banded krait, monocled cobra, and green pit viper in the Northeast — against which the commercially available antivenom does not work.
Artificial interventions
Due to these limitations of antivenoms, researchers are now developing artificially produced antibodies that can help neutralise the toxins across various snake species. They are also looking at artificially designed peptides to fight the toxin.
Venom collection
Experts recommend creating zonal venom collection banks to account for regional venom differences.
However, the
Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972
restricts access to snakes, complicating efforts to establish these banks.

**********The President's power to issue Pardon, in the United States and in India
Why in news?
U.S. President Joe Biden has issued a full and unconditional pardon to his son, Hunter Biden, for cases involving tax evasion and lying about drug use while purchasing a firearm.
Reports suggest Biden is also considering
pre-emptive pardons
for allies, including Vice President Kamala Harris, former Chief Medical Officer Anthony Fauci, and Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, to protect them from potential prosecution under President-elect Donald Trump.
What’s in today’s article?
The US President’s power to pardon
The limits of the US President’s power to pardon
Pre-emptive pardons
The power to pardon in India
About
The President of the US has the constitutional right to pardon or commute sentences related to federal crimes.
The US Supreme Court has held that this power is “granted without limit” and cannot be restricted by Congress.
Clemency is a
broad executive power, and is discretionary
The President is not answerable for his pardons, and does not have to provide a reason for issuing one.
Constitutional provision
Article 2, Section II, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution grants the President the power to issue pardons for federal offenses, except in cases of impeachment.
A pardon nullifies punishment but does not overturn convictions.
Historical Roots of the Pardon Power
The concept of pardon originates from English legal traditions, tracing back to King Ine of Wessex in the 7th century, who exercised the “prerogative of mercy.”
This authority was later delegated to colonial authorities in America before influencing the framers of the U.S. Constitution.
Inclusion in the U.S. Constitution
In 1787, Alexander Hamilton proposed the Presidential pardon power at the Constitutional Convention.
A debate followed about Senate involvement, but the power was ultimately vested solely in the President as part of the Executive branch, separate from legislative and judicial functions.
Role of the Office of the Pardon Attorney
The Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney processes pardon petitions, conducting initial reviews and FBI background checks.
The office makes
non-binding recommendations to the President
, who has the final authority.
Application Process for Pardons
While the
President can pardon federal crimes at any time
, the DoJ requires individuals to a
pply only after a five-year period following release from confinement
, demonstrating a law-abiding life during this time.
Express Limitations on Presidential Pardons
Federal Offenses Only: The President can pardon crimes under federal law but not offenses under state laws.
No Pardons in Impeachment Cases
: The President’s authority does not extend to impeachment cases.
Implied Limitation on Pardons
A crime must first be committed for the President to issue a pardon.
As ruled in Ex Parte Garland (1866), a
pardon can be granted at any stage: before legal proceedings, during them, or after conviction and judgment
Impact and Interpretation of Pardons
No Erasure of Record
: A pardon
does not remove the conviction
; both the conviction and pardon remain on the individual’s criminal record.
No Declaration of Innocence
: A pardon does not imply innocence, nor is it definitively considered an admission of guilt.
Can the President pardon someone to protect them ‘pre-emptively’ from future criminal prosecution?
The President cannot preemptively pardon future criminal acts, as clarified by the Ex Parte Garland ruling and the Constitution Annotated.
Preemptive Pardons for Past Crimes
While not applicable to future offenses,
the President can pardon individuals for crimes already committed, even before charges are filed or sentences imposed
Historical examples
include:
Gerald Ford pardoning Richard Nixon
: A broad pardon for any offenses Nixon "has committed or may have committed."
Abraham Lincoln
: Pardoned Confederate deserters during the Civil War to encourage defections.
Jimmy Carter
: Pardoned Vietnam War draft evaders who had not been charged.
Presidential Pardon Powers under Article 72 of Indian Constitution
The President of India is empowered to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment and to suspend, remit, or commute sentences in the following cases:
Court Martial
: Sentences imposed by military courts.
Union Law Offenses
: Punishments for offenses under laws where the Union has executive authority.
Death Sentences
: Cases involving the death penalty.
Judicial Interpretation of Article 72
Acting on Advice
: In Maru Ram v. Union of India (1980), the Supreme Court ruled that the President must act on the advice of the Central Government when granting pardons.
Although the President is bound by the Cabinet’s advice, Article 74(1) empowers him to return it for reconsideration once.
If the Council of Ministers decides against any change, the President has no option but to accept it.
Judicial Review
: Challenges to the use of Article 72 are limited to rare cases where the decision is deemed “wholly irrelevant, irrational, discriminatory, or mala fide.”

**********The significance of ANI versus OpenAI
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to AI;
Why in the News?
The lawsuit against OpenAI in India is poised to establish key precedents for defining the legal accountability of AI developers regarding the content generated by their platforms within the country.
What are the core allegations made by ANI against OpenAI?
Unauthorized Use of Copyrighted Content:
ANI alleges that OpenAI used its copyrighted news content to train its language models without obtaining the necessary permissions, constituting copyright infringement.
Verbatim Reproduction:
ANI claims that ChatGPT generates responses that are either verbatim or substantially similar to its original articles, which violates copyright protections. They argue that this reproduction occurs without authorization.
False Attribution and Fabricated Information:
ANI highlights instances where ChatGPT has attributed false statements or fabricated interviews to the agency, which they argue damages their reputation and risks spreading misinformation.
Ineffectiveness of Opt-Out Policy:
ANI contends that OpenAI’s opt-out policy is ineffective because their content is still accessible through third-party websites, allowing OpenAI’s crawlers to scrape it despite ANI’s attempts to block access.
Request for Legal Restraints:
ANI is seeking an interim injunction to prevent OpenAI from storing, using, or reproducing its work, as well as prohibiting access to its content through any means.
How does this case reflect broader issues in AI and copyright law?
Liability of AI Platforms:
The case presents an unresolved legal question regarding whether AI platforms can be held liable for copyright infringement when they use publicly available content for training purposes. This issue is not only pertinent in India but also resonates globally, as similar lawsuits have emerged in other jurisdictions.
Fair Use and Exceptions:
The interpretation of fair use and the applicability of exceptions such as text and data mining (TDM) in the context of AI training remain ambiguous under Indian law. The court’s decision will be crucial in determining whether existing copyright frameworks can accommodate the unique characteristics of AI technologies.
Territoriality in Data Storage:
OpenAI’s defence centres on the argument that it operates outside India, complicating the application of Indian copyright law. This raises broader concerns about data sovereignty and how traditional legal concepts apply to cloud-based services and distributed AI models.
What implications does this case have for the future of AI development and media partnerships?
Setting Legal Precedents:
The case may establish important legal precedents regarding the responsibilities of AI companies toward content creators, influencing how future disputes are resolved in India and potentially beyond.
Impact on Licensing Agreements:
As seen with other publishers entering licensing agreements with AI firms, this case could encourage more formalised partnerships where media organisations negotiate terms for their content’s use in AI training, ensuring they receive compensation for their intellectual property.
Regulatory Framework Development:
The lawsuit may prompt Indian lawmakers to consider new regulations addressing the use of copyrighted material by AI platforms, potentially leading to clearer guidelines that balance innovation with the rights of content creators.
Challenges for Smaller Publishers:
While larger media organisations may have the resources to negotiate favourable terms with AI companies, smaller publishers could face difficulties without similar leverage. This disparity could affect diversity in media representation and innovation within the industry.
Way forward:
Establish a Balanced Regulatory Framework
: Policymakers should develop clear guidelines addressing the use of copyrighted material by AI platforms, incorporating provisions for text and data mining (TDM) and fair use exceptions.
Promote Collaborative Licensing Models
: Media organisations and AI firms should work towards formalised licensing agreements that outline terms for the use of copyrighted content in AI training.
