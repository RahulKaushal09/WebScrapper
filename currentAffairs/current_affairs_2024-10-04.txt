Key Facts about Charon
Scientists have detected the gases carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on Pluto's largest moon, 'Charon'.
About Charon:
It is the
largest of Pluto's five moons
, about half the size of Pluto.
It was discovered telescopically on June 22, 1978, by James W. Christy and Robert S. Harrington at the U.S. Naval Observatory station in Flagstaff, Arizona.
The moon was named for Charon, the ferryman of dead souls to the realm of Hades (the Greek counterpart of the Roman god Pluto) in Greek mythology.
Charon is 754 miles (1,214 kilometers) across, and Pluto is about 1,400 miles wide.
Its mass is more than
one-tenth of Pluto’s mass.
Since Charon is
and massive
with respect to Pluto
– the two are
sometimes
referred to as a double dwarf planet system.
The distance between them is 12,200 miles (19,640 km).
same surfaces of
Charon and Pluto
always face each other
, a phenomenon called
mutual tidal locking.
In addition, Charon always shows the same hemisphere to Pluto, because (like many other moons) its rotation period is identical to its orbital period.
Charon orbits Pluto
every 6.4 Earth days.

**********What is the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)?
Giving relief to exporters of certain products, the European Commission has proposed to extend the implementation of its deforestation regulation by one year.
About European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR):
It was scheduled to commence
on 30 December 2024.
It has been introduced to
limit the EU market’s impact on global deforestation/forest degradation
and biodiversity loss, promote deforestation-free supply chains, reduce the EU’s contribution to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, and protect human rights and the rights of indigenous people.
Under the EUDR, certain products for export to the
European Union (EU)
will have to meet
new rules relating to the land on which they were produced
Commodities targeted by the EUDR are:
Cattle
(including beef)
Cocoa
Wood
Coffee
Oil Palm
Rubber
Soya
It also extends to a range of relevant products derived from these commodities, such as
leather, chocolate, and paper
Exporters will need to prove that these
goods/products do not originate from land where forests haven't been cut
since Jan. 1, 2021, regardless of whether the deforestation was legal in the countries of origin.
They will need to provide clear evidence to EU operators and EU traders to support this.
Small businesses further down the supply chain are subject to the same obligations and retain legal responsibility if regulations are violated.
But they are
not liable for due diligence for parts of their products
that were already subject to review.
Failure to comply can result in financial penalties and restricted access to the EU market.
Country Benchmarking
The EUDR will also have a country benchmarking system. This will determine the
deforestation and degradation risk of each nation
Nations will be classed on a
3-tier system
, from low-risk to high-risk.
A nation’s risk classification will establish the level of scrutiny by the EU.
This includes the proportion of consignments inspected by the relevant authorities.

**********What is Vaikom Satyagraha?
The Tamil Nadu government has cleared the decks for the construction of a memorial for social reformer Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, one of the leaders of the Vaikom Satyagraha, at Arookutty in Alappuzha, Kerala.
About Vaikom Satyagraha:
It was a
social reform movement
which originated and took its place at
, then part of the
princely state of Travancore
, in Kottayam district of
Kerala,
between 1924 and 1925
It was the dawn of
temple entry movements
in India.
Background:
Vaikom Mahadevar Temple
was the epicenter of the town, and
Dalits were
prohibited
from entering
the temple premises or even using the road that encircled the temple.
In the All India Congress Committee (AICC)
meeting in Kakinada in 1923
K Madhavan,

Sardar Panikkar
KP Kesava
Menon, submitted a
petition
to the
Travancore legislative council.
The petition sought to grant the
right to temple entry
worship of gods for all sections of the society
, irrespective of caste, creed, and community.
During a tour of the region by leaders like
Kelappan
, a demand was made to allow everyone to use the road, but the
temple authorities refused
This refusal led to the commencement of Satyagraha.
The Satyagraha was led by
prominent leaders
such as
Kelappan, T. K. Madhavan,
K. P. Kesava Menon
, among others.
Young volunteers
from all over Kerala joined the Satyagraha to fight against untouchability.

High antiquity
of (its) early texts/recorded history over a period of
1500- 2000 years.
body of ancient literature/texts
, which is considered a heritage by generations of speakers.
Knowledge texts, especially prose texts in addition to poetry, epigraphical and inscriptional evidence.
The Classical Languages and literature could be distinct from its current form or could be discontinuous with later forms of its offshoots.
Other Recognised Classical Languages are: Tamil
( 2004),
Sanskrit
(2005),
Telugu
( 2008),

**********Prison Reform in India
Why in News?
The Supreme Court issued a series of directives to the Centre and states to ensure that
no inmate is subjected to work assignments or housing arrangements based on their caste
.  The SC declared this
provision in various jail manuals “unconstitutional”
for violating the inmates’ right to dignity, equality and non-discrimination.
The ruling ended the long-standing practice of discrimination against prisoners based on caste and demanded prompt reforms in all states and UTs.
What’s in Today’s Article?
SC’s Verdict on Caste Bias, Segregation in Prisons
Issues Related to Prisons in India
Prison Reforms - Recommendations of Committees, Provisions of Laws and Key Judgements
SC’s Verdict on Caste Bias, Segregation in Prisons:
Background:
The court’s verdict came on a petition moved by a journalist, urging the court to issue clear directions to ensure that all prison manuals and practices (that reinforce caste hierarchies) are overhauled.
The court’s verdict:
The verdict
specifically addressed
the entrenched
discriminatory practices against marginalised
communities, including scheduled castes (SC), scheduled tribes (ST) and denotified tribes (DNTs)
in India’s prisons
The apex court held that the treatment of inmates from
DNTs as “habitual offenders”
within prison walls across India are oppressive to fundamental human dignity and personality.
The bench held that caste-based assignments of labour, such as assigning menial tasks (cleaning and sweeping) to marginalised castes while reserving cooking for higher castes, is a
violation of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
The provision that food shall be cooked by ‘suitable caste’ reflects notions of untouchability prohibited under the Constitution in
Article 17
The SC expanded the scope of Article 21
, stating that caste-based discrimination hinders personal growth and development.
The court further held that the selective assignment of menial jobs to specific castes amounted to forced labour under
Article 23.
The judgement highlighted several gaps in
the Model Prison Manual of 2016
in addressing caste-based discrimination.
The court noted that it failed to fully eliminate caste-based segregation and labour division in prisons.
It also criticised the manual for not incorporating
the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013
that bans manual scavenging.
Court’s directives to Centre, states and UTs:
To combat caste-based prejudices, the bench called for strict adherence to guidelines laid down in
Arnesh Kumar Vs State of Bihar (2014) and Amanatullah Khan Vs Commissioner of Police, Delhi (2024.
The guidelines require police officers to
ensure procedural safeguards
, particularly for vulnerable communities, reinforcing the broader fight against systemic biases.
Issues Related to Prisons in India:
Fundamental rights of prisoners:
Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.
Article 39A
ensures free legal aid for those in need.
Key issues in Indian prisons:
Prison conditions in India face several critical challenges that
impact inmates' rights and welfare.
These include -
Overcrowding:
Currently, prisons in India
operate at 117% capacity
, primarily due to a high number of under-trial prisoners.
The SC has emphasised the right to speedy justice under Article 21 of the Constitution, but many cases remain unresolved.
Unhygienic conditions:
Many inmates lack access to proper medical facilities. Female prisoners often do not receive adequate sanitary products and basic health services.
Custodial torture:
Despite the
1986 DK Basu judgement
prohibiting torture, reports of custodial violence continue, with increasing cases of custodial deaths.
Delays in trials:
Lengthy legal processes disrupt prison administration and prolong inmates' suffering. The right to a speedy trial has been recognised but is often not upheld.
Challenges for women prisoners:
The number of female inmates is rising, but they often face inadequate facilities. There is also a lack of dedicated women’s prisons.
Prison Reforms - Recommendations of Committees, Provisions of Laws and Key Judgements:
Justice Mulla committee 1983:
It recommended -
Improved prison accommodations,
Creation of the Indian Prisons and Correctional Services,
Public and media visits for transparency,
Reduction of under-trial prisoners through expedited trials.
A national policy on prisons.
Using alternatives to imprisonment, such as community service, etc.
Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer committee 1987:
Induction of more women into the police force.
Separate institutions with women employees alone, especially for women offenders.
Necessary provisions to restore the dignity of convicted women.
Justice Amitav Roy panel (2018) of the SC:
It recommended several prison reforms - special fast track courts, improvements in lawyer-prisoners ratio, use of video-conferencing for trial, etc.
Provisions of the Model Prisoners Act of 2023:
Legal aid to prisoners:
It is the state’s duty to provide free legal aid by suitable legislation or schemes.
Parole:
It is a form of early release for prison inmates where the prisoner agrees to abide by behavioural conditions.
Furlough:
It is the right of prisoners to retain family and social ties. This also helps them counter the ill effects of prolonged time spent in prison.
Other provisions:
Special facilities for women and transgender prisoners, Provisions for use of technology in prison administration, etc.
Key case laws:
Hussainara Khatoon vs. Home Secretary (1979): Emphasises the
right to a speedy trial.
State of Rajasthan vs. Balchand (1978):
Establishes that bail is the rule, not jail.

**********Criminalising Marital Rape in India
Why in the News?
The central government has opposed the criminalisation of marital rape in the Supreme Court, stating that matter relating to marital rape needs a "comprehensive approach" rather than a "strict legal approach".
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Marital Rape (Section 375 of IPC, marital rape laws, arguments in favour/against)
Examples from other countries
News Summary (Key Arguments by the Central Government)
Evolution of Section 375 of the IPC:
defines the acts that constitute rape by a man
The provision, however, lays down
two exceptions
as well:
It
decriminalises marital rape
It mentions that medical procedures or interventions shall not constitute rape.
The IPC was implemented in India during British colonial rule in 1860.
Under the first version of the rules, the marital rape exception was applicable to women over ten years of age. In 1940, this age was raised to 15.
However, in October 2017,
the Supreme Court ruled that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, if the wife is under eighteen years of age, shall be considered as rape
The court ruled that the age of consent should be 18, not 15.
History of Martial Rape Law in India:
Domestic Violence Act, 2005
hints at marital rape by any form of sexual abuse in a live-in or marriage relationship.
However, it only provides for civil remedies.
There is no way for marital rape victims in India to initiate criminal proceedings against their perpetrator
need to remove this marital rape exception was rejected by the Law Commission of India’s 172
report in 2000
, while considering several proposals to reform India's laws on sexual violence.
Issues with Exception to Marital Rape:
marital rape exception, thus, creates a legal fiction where, even if all the requirements for rape are otherwise fulfilled, the law deems not to be rape if the parties are married
Apart from being harmful and discriminatory towards women, the marital rape exception is also entirely
arbitrary
If sexual assault takes place five minutes before a marriage is formalised, it is rape; but five minutes after, it is not.
Sexual assault will be rape if it is committed within the context of a live-in relationship – or any other intimate relationship — and yet, this legal immunity under Section 375 of the IPC kicks in where that relationship has been formalised.
The marital rape exception thus denies to one class of women — married women — the guarantees that law offers to all others.
Arguments against Criminalising Marital Rape:
Misuse of law
Misuse of the law is a big reason why several individuals, jurists and even men’s rights activists have raised alarm over the criminalisation of marital rape.
The statistics cited to argue against the criminalisation of marital rape are those of the misuse of 498A, the law that relates to dowry cases
A total of 1,11,549 cases were registered under 498A in 2020. Of these, 5,520 were closed by Police citing as false and overall, 16,151 cases were closed by police either because they were false or there was a mistake of fact or law or it was a civil dispute etc.
18,967 cases were tried in courts of which 14,340 led to acquittal and 3,425 led to a conviction.
498A cases pending trial at the end of 2020 are 651,404 with a pendency percentage of 96.2%.
Burden of proof
The burden of proof is a hugely complex issue that has prevented marital rape to be criminalised.
In the case of marital rape, one has to consider that intercourse is a part of any marriage.
Now, if marital rape itself is criminalised, the question remains who would the burden of proof be on and what would that burden be.
Gender neutrality
Arguments to make the definition of ‘rape’ gender-neutral has been put forward on many occasions, and the same argument is put forward in the case of marital rapes too.
Even if the exception of IPC section 375 is removed or criminal provisions are added to the Domestic Violence act, husbands will not be able to use those
How is Marital Rape Treated Around the World?
According to Amnesty International data,
77 out of 185 (42%) countries criminalise marital rape through legislation
Australia
(1981),
Canada
(1983),
South Africa
(1993), the
USA
(1993) have enacted laws that criminalise marital rape.
In many countries, it is either not mentioned or is explicitly excluded from rape laws.
United Nations has urged countries to end marital rape by closing legal loopholes, saying that “the home is one of the most dangerous places for women”
News Summary:
The Central Government has
, arguing that the issue requires a comprehensive socio-legal approach rather than a strict legal one.
The government expressed concerns that criminalising marital rape could have significant consequences for the institution of marriage and lead to serious disruptions in marital relationships.
Key Points from the Government’s Arguments:
Far-Reaching Implications:
The government stated that making sexual acts between a husband and wife punishable as "rape" could severely impact conjugal relationships and disrupt the institution of marriage.
Parliamentary Decision:
The Centre informed the court that Parliament, after thorough deliberation, had retained Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which exempts marital rape from being classified as a criminal offense.
This decision was made during amendments to Section 375 in 2013.
Separate Legal Provisions for Consent within Marriage:
While the government acknowledged that a husband's violation of his wife's consent is unacceptable, it argued that the consequences within marriage should differ from those outside of it.
The affidavit mentioned that criminal law provisions are already in place to address violations of consent within marriage.
Concerns over Judicial Interference:
The Centre urged the Supreme Court not to interfere with Parliament's decision to retain the marital rape exception.
It argued that such interference would be inappropriate, given the socio-legal context of marriage in India.
Disproportionate Punishment:
The affidavit suggested that labelling marital sexual acts as "rape" could be considered excessively harsh and disproportionate in the context of marriage.
The government emphasized the importance of preserving the institution of marriage while also protecting the rights of women.
Supreme Court's Previous Ruling:
In 2022, the Supreme Court had recognized marital rape for the purposes of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, which allowed women to seek abortions for pregnancies resulting from marital rape.
However, the Centre's current stance highlights a distinction between this ruling and the broader criminalisation of marital rape.

**********Bihar under water - Why the state sees floods every year
Why in news?
Bihar is once again facing severe floods, affecting 11.84 lakh people who have been displaced, relying on air-dropped food packets and shelters, and at risk of water-borne diseases.
North Bihar experiences annual flooding, with lakhs of people seeing their crops and livestock destroyed each time. Despite efforts to rebuild, the cycle of devastation repeats every year.
What’s in today’s article?
Bihar’s vulnerability
Why is Bihar prone to annual flooding?
Economic impact of Bihar’s floods
Potential Solution
Vulnerability
Bihar is India’s most flood-prone state, with
76 per cent of the population in north Bihar living under the recurring threat of flood devastation
Bihar is crisscrossed by both snow-fed and rain-fed rivers, putting it at the risk of various kinds of floods.
Four distinct types of floods
Flash floods
– It occurs due to rainfall in Nepal, lead time [time between forecast and flood] is short (8 hours), receding of flood waters is fast.
River floods
– It is typically caused by overflowing rivers. In this, the lead time is 24 hours and receding of flood waters takes one week or more.
Drainage congestion floods
: Occur in river confluences, taking more than 24 hours to develop and often lasting the entire monsoon season (about three months for water to recede).
Permanent waterlogging
: Affected areas remain waterlogged throughout the year.
Reason for first three kinds of floods
A major reason for the first three kinds of flooding is that
Bihar is located below Nepal
, with its Himalayan rivers flowing down to the state.
Because the Himalayas are a young mountain range with a lot of loose soil, these rivers —
Kosi, Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kamla Balan, Mahananda, Adhwara — are full of sediments
Thus, when the volume of water increases due to rains, the rivers quickly overflow their banks.
Reasons behind the fourth category of permanent waterlogging
The reasons of water-logging are spilling of silted small rivers, encroachment of drainage channels, embankment-induced waterlogging, and presence of
saucer type depression locally called Chaurs
Chaurs are created due to a river changing course and deposition of its sediments.
Kosi challenge
Bihar’s geography makes annual floods inevitable, with the Kosi River, known as the "
sorrow of Bihar
," being one of the most destructive.
In the 1950s, embankments were constructed along the Kosi to control its flow, initially seen as a permanent solution.
However, these embankments have frequently been breached and have introduced a new issue.
By narrowing the river's course, the embankments have trapped sediments, causing the riverbed to rise by about 5 inches annually.
This rising riverbed has made the Kosi more prone to overflowing, worsening the flood situation in the region.
Flood in 2024
This year, the flood has been caused by
heavy rainfall and flooding in Nepal
and release of water from its barrage on the Kosi river.
This year’s flooding in Bihar is worse due to the r
elease of 6.6 lakh cusec of water from the Birpur barrage on the Kosi River in Nepal
, the highest discharge in nearly six decades.
In India, embankments breached in seven locations across four districts, despite being designed to handle 9.5 lakh cusec.
The breaches are occurring because the river has become shallower
Around 380 villages, home to 15 lakh people, are trapped within the embankments, with no escape from the recurring floods.
While the floods in Bihar don’t always result in significant loss of life, the economic toll is substantial.
Damage to crops, livestock, and infrastructure is considerable, and the resulting distress migration exacerbates the state’s economic challenges.
The government spends around Rs 1,000 crore annually on flood relief and management.
Possible solutions
For decades, building a dam on the Kosi River has been proposed as a flood solution, but it requires cooperation from Nepal, delaying progress.
Recently, Bihar govt requested the construction of an additional barrage on the Kosi and barrages on other rivers like the Gandak and Bagmati.
However, the frequent breaches of embankments suggest that
engineering solutions alone may not suffice
Experts have emphasized the need for both
structural and non-structural solutions
Non-structural approaches include laws, risk reduction, early warnings, and flood preparedness.
The Flood Atlas of Bihar also advocates
focusing on minimizing risk and damage rather than relying solely on structural measures along dynamic rivers like the Kosi

**********UK hands over Chagos Islands to Mauritius
Why in news?
Britain has agreed to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, a group of over 60 islands in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius.
This deal ensures the future of the UK-US military base on Diego Garcia, the largest island, with its status now undisputed and legally secure for the first time in over 50 years.
India welcomed the agreement, seeing it as completing the decolonization of Mauritius.
What’s in today’s article?
Chagos Islands dispute
Geographical location
Chagos Archipelago is located in the central Indian Ocean, about 500 kilometers south of the Maldives and roughly 1,600 kilometers southwest of India.
The Chagos archipelago comprises of 58 islands, with Diego Garcia being the largest and most significant.
Colonial history of Chagos
According to a report, the Chagos Islands were discovered by Portuguese navigators in the 16th century, who mapped and named some of them.
The Dutch explored the islands next but did not settle there.
The islands later came under French control, along with Mauritius and Réunion, and the French gave additional names to the islands.
They brought enslaved workers from Madagascar and Mozambique, followed by laborers from southern India, to work on coconut plantations.
After Napoleon's defeat, Britain took control of both Chagos and Mauritius.
In 1814, France ceded the islands to the British.
Significance of Chagos
Geostrategic Location
: The archipelago's location in the central Indian Ocean makes it strategically valuable for monitoring major shipping lanes, ensuring security in the region, and projecting military power across a wide area.
UK-US Military Base
: Diego Garcia, the largest island, hosts a major UK-US military base, which is crucial for operations in the Indian Ocean and surrounding regions.
It serves as a logistics, surveillance, and intelligence hub for both the UK and the US, playing a key role in military operations in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.
Environmental and Biodiversity Significance
: The Chagos Archipelago is home to one of the largest coral atolls and is rich in marine biodiversity.
Its pristine environment has made it important for scientific research and conservation efforts.
UK Declares Chagos Islands as Overseas Territory
In November 1965, the UK declared the Chagos Islands as an overseas territory.
After Mauritius gained independence in 1968, the UK refused to return the islands.
In 1965, the UK constituted the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), of which the Chagos Islands were a central part.
Chagos was attached to Mauritius, another British colony in the Indian Ocean, for administrative purposes.
When Mauritius gained independence in 1968, Chagos remained with Britain.
The UK government gave the newly-independent country a grant of 3 million pounds over the “detachment” of the Chagos archipelago.
Strategic Military Use of Diego Garcia
Diego Garcia became the site of a major UK-US military base, which played a crucial role in US-led operations in Afghanistan and Iraq in the 2000s.
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the base also served as a CIA interrogation site.
Mauritius’ Proposal and UK’s Rejection
After gaining independence, Mauritius proposed allowing the UK to lease the islands to the US for defense purposes in exchange for an increased US quota for sugar imports, which would boost Mauritius' economy.
The UK rejected the proposal, claiming the US could not be involved in any treaty, despite benefiting from the islands.
Forced Depopulation of Chagossians
Between 1968 and 1973, the UK and US forcibly removed the native Chagossians to make way for the military base.
The UK denied the inhabitants' connection to the islands, dismissing claims of human rights violations.
Legal Action by Mauritius
In 2015, Mauritius initiated legal proceedings against the UK at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, challenging the UK's sovereignty claims and addressing the forced removal of the Chagossians.
The UK resisted, insisting that the issue should remain a bilateral matter.
Permanent Court of Arbitration’s 2015 Ruling Against the UK
In 2015, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that the UK had violated Mauritius’ rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
The court found that the UK had ulterior motives when it created a Marine Protected Area (MPA) around the Chagos Islands in 2010, intentionally preventing the return of the Chagossians.
The ruling highlighted that British and American defense interests were prioritized over Mauritius' rights, and the UK's actions were deemed a violation of good faith.
UN General Assembly Vote in 2017
In June 2017, the UNGA voted on Mauritius’ resolution to seek an advisory opinion on the Chagos Islands from the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
The result reflected global opposition to colonial legacies and suggested that the UN was unlikely to endorse continued colonial control.
International Court of Justice (ICJ) Ruling in 2019
In February 2019, ICJ ordered the UK to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius as rapidly as possible.
Mauritius argued that it had been coerced into giving up the islands during colonial rule, in violation of UN resolution 1514, which prohibited the breakup of colonies before independence.
The UK claimed that the ICJ had no jurisdiction over the matter.
About the treaty
The UK and Mauritius reached an agreement where the
UK ceded its claims over the Chagos Archipelago
The agreement allows the
UK to retain sovereign rights over Diego Garcia
, where a joint UK-US military base will remain operational for an initial period of 99 years.
Mauritius is now allowed to implement a resettlement program on the islands, except for Diego Garcia.
Additionally, the UK has pledged to create a trust fund to benefit the displaced Chagossians.
Role of India
India has maintained steadfast support to Mauritius’ claims over the Chagos Islands.
It voted in favour of the island country at the UNGA in 2019
In recent years, India has attempted to deepen its ties with Mauritius amidst China’s ever-increasing assertiveness in the Indian Ocean.
Earlier this year, an India-built airstrip and a jetty was inaugurated at Agaléga, a two-island dependency of Mauritius in the Western Indian Ocean.

**********Rules promoting caste bias in jails struck down by Supreme Court
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Caste-based discrimination;
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court declared caste-based discrimination in prisons unconstitutional, ordering immediate reforms in jail manuals nationwide to uphold inmates’ dignity, equality, and non-discrimination rights.
What specific caste-based practices in prison manuals were deemed unconstitutional by the SC?
Work Assignments Based on Caste
: The assignment of menial tasks like cleaning and sweeping to marginalized castes (e.g., SCs, STs, DNTs) while reserving cooking roles for higher castes was ruled unconstitutional.
This violated
Articles 14 (Right to Equality)
Article 15 (Prohibition of Discrimination on Grounds of Religion, Race, Caste, etc.)
Caste-based Classification of Labour
: The court struck down provisions in prison manuals that classified inmates into different labour roles based on their caste, calling it a form of “untouchability” and caste hierarchy.
References to ‘Scavenger Class’
: The reference to specific castes as the “scavenger class” was condemned as reinforcing caste stereotypes, and the court ruled such practices unconstitutional under
Article 17 (abolition of untouchability).
Assignment of Hazardous Tasks
: Marginalized prisoners forced to clean sewers and tanks in unsafe conditions was also ruled a violation of their dignity under
Article 21 (Right to Life with Dignity).
How does the ruling reflect the broader implications of caste discrimination in society?
Historical and Societal Caste Biases
: The ruling emphasized that caste-based discrimination in prisons is a remnant of
colonial and pre-colonial oppressive systems,
designed to dehumanize marginalized groups.
Reinforcement of Stereotypes
: The court noted that prison rules, by assigning certain jobs to marginalized castes, indirectly
perpetuate historical stereotypes and social hierarchies,
harming personal growth and development, and fostering caste prejudices.
India’s prisons face other challenges too:
Overcrowding:
In 2016, India’s prisons were 20% over capacity, with some prisons over 500% capacity. Overcrowding can lead to poor living conditions and the spread of disease.
Poor hygiene and Custodial torture:
Prisoners face physical abuse and sexual abuse, and police may also torture prisoners. Prisons are underfunded, which leads to poor infrastructure, inadequate food, and insufficient clothing.
Understaffing:
33% of prison official positions are vacant. Prison management is a state subject, so prison rules vary by state.
Ineffective bail system:
The bail system contributes to the crisis of undertrial incarceration.
What are the actions mandated by the SC?
Reform of Prison Manuals
: All states and Union territories must revise their prison manuals within three months to align with the judgment, eliminating discriminatory provisions.
The Union government is required to update the
Model Prison Manual 2016
Model Prisons
Correctional Services Act 2023
within the same period.
Removal of Caste-Based Work Assignments
: The court ordered that no inmate be subjected to work or housing arrangements based on their caste. The caste column in registers of undertrial and convicted prisoners must be deleted.
Prohibition of Hazardous Work
: The court mandated that manual scavenging or hazardous cleaning of sewers or septic tanks in prisons be prohibited, in line with the
2013 law banning manual scavenging.
Arrest Guidelines for DNTs
: The court called for strict adherence to guidelines (from
Arnesh Kumar Vs State of Bihar
Amanatullah Khan Vs Commissioner of Police
, Delhi cases) to prevent arbitrary arrests of denotified tribe members.
Compliance Oversight
: The court initiated
suo motu
proceedings to monitor the implementation of these reforms and ordered states and the
Union government to submit compliance reports,
ensuring sustained oversight.
Conclusion:
The Supreme Court’s landmark ruling ends caste-based discrimination in prisons, mandating nationwide reforms in jail manuals, safeguarding inmates’ dignity, and promoting equality by eliminating discriminatory caste-based practices and work assignments.

With escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, India’s Ministry of External Affairs she emphasized the need to prevent regional escalation, urging all parties to resolve issues through dialogue and diplomacy for stability.
Can India act as a mediator in the Iran-Israel conflict?
India maintains
strong strategic and economic ties
with both Israel and Iran, allowing it to communicate with both parties. This balanced relationship positions India as a potential neutral mediator.
India’s stature on the global stage is rising, and its history of
non-alignment
and support for
peaceful dialogue
gives it credibility. However, balancing its strategic partnerships with Israel, Iran, and key Arab states will be challenging.
What are India’s strategic interests in West Asia?
Energy Security:
West Asia is crucial for India’s energy needs, supplying about
80% of its oil imports.
A wider conflict could disrupt these supplies and increase energy prices, impacting India’s economy significantly.
Economic Ties:
India has invested heavily in its relationships with West Asian countries, viewing the region as an extension of its neighborhood. This includes trade partnerships and investments, particularly with major Arab nations and Israel.
Security Concerns:
India shares concerns with both
regarding terrorism, particularly threats emanating from
Pakistan and Afghanistan
. This common ground could facilitate dialogue but also complicates India’s diplomatic balancing act.
How does India’s relationship with regional powers influence its role?
Regional Dynamics:
Other regional players such as Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey also influence the situation. Qatar has been active in mediating between conflicting parties, while Egypt’s geographical proximity to Gaza positions it as a key player in ceasefire discussions.
Saudi Arabia’s leadership role in the Islamic world adds another layer of complexity to India’s diplomatic efforts.
Multi-faceted Role:
While India maintains strong defense and economic relations with Israel, it also relies on Iran for energy supplies and has historical ties to various Arab nations.
Balancing these relationships is critical for India’s foreign policy strategy.
Way forward:
Diplomatic Engagement and Back-Channel Diplomacy

Economic Dependence vs. Strategic Hedging
: Vietnam’s growing economic interdependence with China, reflected in trade and investment, contrasts with its
efforts to hedge against over-reliance
by fostering ties with other global players. This balancing act illustrates Vietnam’s pragmatic approach to foreign policy.
Challenges Vietnam Faces in Maintaining Sovereignty Amid Growing Chinese Influence:
Territorial Disputes
: The ongoing territorial contestation over the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea poses a significant challenge for Vietnam.
: While Vietnam benefits from economic ties with China, the growing trade deficit and increased Chinese investments create a dependency that could challenge Vietnam’s autonomy in decision-making, especially in strategic areas like infrastructure and connectivity.
Strategic Hedging and Sovereignty
: Vietnam’s efforts to hedge against Chinese influence through partnerships with the U.S., Japan, and India.
Note:
refers to a strategic approach taken by a country to safeguard its interests and security in a complex and uncertain environment.
