We Can Hear the Apathy: Truth About Women’s Abuse in Malayalam Cinema is Out. Does Anyone Really Care?
Context
The release of the
Hema Committee (HC) report on August 19 marks a significant moment in the ongoing struggle for gender equality
within the Malayalam film industry.
This report, commissioned by the Chief Minister of Kerala
at the request of the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), is a
critical reflection on the myriad issues faced by women in this sector.
reaction to the report has been mixed,
with sensationalism and apathy overshadowing meaningful engagement.
Therefore,
it is important to delve into the report's findings, the systemic issues it highlights,
and the broader implications for gender equity in the film industry and beyond.
Hema Committee Report, its Significance and Broader Impact
A Comprehensive Documentation of Gender-Based Issues
One of the most critical aspects
of the Hema Committee report is
its role as a thorough documentation of the gender-based challenges faced by women
report is not limited to instances of sexual harassment
, though these are undoubtedly significant.
It
goes beyond to expose a wide array of constitutional, labour, and human rights violations
that women in the industry endure.
By identifying at least 17 distinct forms of exploitation
across 30 different professional categories, the
report provides an unprecedented level of detail about the systemic issues within the industry.
A Reflection on Women’s Everyday Struggle
These
findings are crucial because they bring to light the everyday struggles of women
working in various capacities within the film industry, struggles that have often been overlooked or dismissed.
For many women,
the film industry has been a space where their rights are routinely violated,
where power dynamics are skewed against them, and where their contributions are undervalued.
report’s meticulous cataloguing of these issues offers a comprehensive understanding of the scale and scope of gender-based discrimination
Challenging Existing Power Structures
significance of the Hema Committee report also lies in its challenge to the entrenched power structures
industry has long been dominated by a patriarchal culture
that marginalises women and perpetuates gender inequities.
The report,
by exposing the extent of exploitation and abuse, directly confronts these power dynamics.
serves as a bold indictment of the industry's failure to protect the rights and dignity of women,
highlighting the urgent need for systemic change.
Empowering Women’s Voices and Experiences
Another critical aspect of the report's significance is
its empowerment of women's voices within the industry.
For years,
women in the Malayalam film industry have been silenced
, their experiences of discrimination and harassment ignored or trivialised.
Hema Committee report provides a platform for these women to share their stories,
validating their experiences and bringing them to the forefront of public consciousness.
A Broader Impact on Gender Equity Discourse
Finally,
the significance of the Hema Committee report extends beyond the Malayalam film industry.
contributes to the broader discourse on gender equity in the workplace, particularly in industries that have historically been male-dominated
and resistant to change.
report's findings resonate with the experiences of women in other industries,
highlighting the universal challenges of gender discrimination, harassment, and inequality.
Troubling Aspects of Response to Hema Committee Report
The Noise of Sensationalism and Apathy
Despite the gravity of the report's findings,
the public discourse has largely focused on sensational aspects,
particularly sexual harassment, overshadowing the broader structural issues.
sensationalism distracts from the need for systemic change
, reducing the conversation to isolated incidents rather than addressing the underlying causes of gender inequity.
The Tendency of Victim Blaming
A troubling aspect of the response
is the tendency to push
the burden of resolution back onto the victims.
Women who bravely shared their experiences with the committee are now being urged to take legal action
, a process fraught with challenges.
legal system often requires evidence that is difficult to produce in cases of sexual harassment
, leading to further victimization and psychological distress for those involved.
Tendency to Universalise the Issue
Another significant issue is the tendency to universalise the problems identified in the report, thereby deflecting responsibility.
A member of a film association remarked, "Don’t these issues exist in other industries, why only blame us?"
This argument is not only morally questionable but also fundamentally flawed.
film industry, with its unique structure and lack of accountability, cannot be directly compared to other sectors.
The challenges faced by women in this industry are exacerbated by the absence of a formal organizational framework, making the need for targeted solutions even more pressing.
The Irresponsible Role of Bystanders and Government Apathy
Apathy, both from individuals and institutions, is a recurring theme in the response to the HC report.
Bystanders, whether in the industry or in government, often shirk responsibility, assuming that someone else will address the problem.
lack of accountability perpetuates the status quo
, allowing systemic issues to persist unchecked.
The Kerala government's response has been particularly disappointing.
While
the initial decision to establish the Hema Committee was a positive step
subsequent delay in releasing the report and the lack of concrete action suggest a waning commitment to gender equity.
The government's inaction
, despite the detailed findings of the report,
highlights a broader problem of institutional apathy towards gender-related issues.
Way Forward: The Need for Political Will and Systemic Change
Kerala, which became the first Indian state to achieve full literacy in 1991, owes much of its progress to the cultural revolution
initiated by social reformers and the Left government in 1957.
Today,
the state faces a similar challenge: whether to lead the way in gender inclusion and safety in the film industry
or to succumb to apathy and inertia.
government's actions in the coming months
will be crucial not only
for the future of women in Kerala's film industry but also for setting a precedent for other states.
choice is between superficial brand-building exercises and genuine political will to implement the necessary reforms.
The stakes are high, as the success or failure of these efforts will shape the future of gender-inclusive spaces in cinema and beyond.
Conclusion
release of the Hema Committee report is a critical moment in the fight for gender equity
However,
the response so far has been marked by sensationalism, apathy, and a lack of meaningful engagement
with the report's findings.
Kerala government must demonstrate the political will to implement the necessary reforms, setting an example for other states
and industries to follow and
only then can the vision of a truly inclusive and equitable film industry be realised.

**********Chile’s Atacama salt flat sinking due to Lithium mining
A recent study published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing reveals that Chile's Atacama salt flat is sinking at 1 to 2 centimetres per year due to Lithium brine extraction.
extraction is a process where
salt-rich water is pumped to the surface
and into evaporation ponds to extract lithium
This method is prevalent in salt flats like Chile’s Atacama, one of the world’s largest lithium sources.
Cause of sinking
: The subsidence is occurring because the
rate of lithium-rich brine pumping exceeds the natural recharge rate of the aquifers
, leading to a downward movement of the Earth's surface.
Area of concern
: The most affected region is in the southwest part of the salt flat, where lithium mining operations are concentrated. The sinking area measures approximately
8 km from north to south
5 km from east to west.
What is Lithium?
, often referred to as
“white gold,”
is a highly sought-after metal crucial for the production of rechargeable batteries used in laptops, mobile phones, and electric vehicles, an essential component in global efforts to combat climate change.
Environmental impact of Lithium Mining
Water scarcity
: The extraction process is
water-intensive
; it requires approximately 2,000 tons of water to produce just one ton of lithium.
This is particularly problematic in the Atacama Desert, where water is already scarce, affecting indigenous communities and local wildlife.
Chemical contamination
: Chemicals like
sulfuric acid
sodium hydroxide
used in Lithium extraction contaminate the soil and water, posing a severe threat to ecosystems and endangering species.
Impact on Wildlife
: A 2022 study highlighted that lithium mining has led to a decline in the
flamingo population
in the Atacama region due to reduced water levels, affecting their reproduction.

**********Polaris Dawn Mission
It aims to revolutionise commercial spaceflight with a high-orbit mission and the first-ever private spacewalk by non-professional astronauts.
About Polaris Dawn Mission:
It will be the
first non-governmental mission to conduct a spacewalk
, reaching an unprecedented altitude of approximately 700 kilometres (435 miles) above Earth.
It will also orbit Earth through regions of a highly-charged belt of radiation. There are two of these
“Van Allen Belts”,
an inner and an outer one.
This altitude
surpasses that of the International Space Station (ISS)
, which orbits at about 400 kilometres.
Spacecraft
: SpaceX will provide the
Falcon 9 rocket
and Dragon capsule for the mission. The spacecraft will attempt to break the altitude record set by
NASA’s Gemini 11 mission
in 1966, which reached 1,373 kilometres.
Crew and leadership
: It is spearheaded by billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who previously financed and flew on SpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission, the first civilian mission to orbit Earth.
Understanding the Van Allen Belts:
Composition
: They consist of charged particles trapped by Earth's magnetosphere, which protects the planet from solar storms and cosmic rays.
These belts were first identified in
1958
by the
American physicist James Van Allen.
Location:
Inner belt
: It is located between
680 and 3,000 kilometres
above the Earth's surface, this belt is primarily composed of
high-energy protons
. It forms due to the interaction between cosmic rays and Earth's atmosphere.
Outer belt
: It is situated at altitudes ranging from
15,000 to 20,000 kilometers
above the Earth's surface, the outer belt predominantly consists of
high-energy electrons
originating from the solar wind.
Radiation risks
: The spacewalk will expose the crew to higher levels of radiation than those on the ISS.
The charged particles within these belts can lead to radiation sickness, harm to human tissues, and an increased risk of cancer.
Data collected during this mission will be crucial for future deep-space missions, including NASA’s planned 2025 mission to the Moon and Mars.
Significance of the Spacewalk:
Van Allen belts
: The mission will involve orbiting through the Van Allen Belts, regions of intense radiation that astronauts typically avoid. The ability to navigate these belts is crucial for future missions to Mars.
Testing new spacesuits
four astronauts
on board will test new spacesuits developed by SpaceX. These suits are designed to protect against the heightened radiation found in the Van Allen Belts.
Planned health research:
Biological effects of space travel
: It aims to create research biobanks to study how space travel impacts human biology, including eyesight and brain structure.
These studies address
Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS)
, a significant health risk in space.
Decompression sickness
: It will also contribute to research on decompression sickness (DCS), a condition caused by
nitrogen gas bubbles
damaging human tissue during spaceflight.
Innovation in space communications:
Laser communications test
: The crew will test laser communications provided by SpaceX’s Starlink satellite network.
This technology is vital for future space missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The data from these tests will inform the development of advanced space communication systems.
Polaris Missions ahead:
Mission progression
: Isaacman has committed to
three Polaris missions in collaboration with SpaceX.
The first mission is planned to last five days, with future missions set to push the boundaries of human spaceflight, communications, and scientific research.
Starship test
: The third Polaris mission will involve the
first crewed test of SpaceX’s reusable Starship spacecraft.

**********RBI to launch Unified Lending Interface
Why in news?
The Reserve Bank is piloting an application for frictionless credit —Unified Lending Interface (ULI). It will be launched nationwide soon and will become the UPI on the credit side.
What’s in today’s article?
Unified Payment Interface (UPI)
Background
In August 2023, the RBI initiated a pilot project for a public tech platform designed to streamline credit processes, aiming to reduce costs, expedite disbursements, and enhance scalability.
Recently, RBI Governor proposed naming this platform the Unified Lending Interface (ULI).
He expressed that, much like UPI revolutionized the payments ecosystem, ULI is expected to similarly transform the lending landscape in India.
Need for ULI
India's rapid digitalization has led to the development of digital public infrastructure, encouraging innovation in payments, credit, and financial services by banks, NBFCs, fintech companies, and start-ups.
However,
the necessary data for credit appraisals is scattered across various systems, creating obstacles to smooth and timely lending
About
ULI will enable a seamless, consent-based flow of digital information, including state land records, from multiple sources to lenders.
This will expedite credit appraisals, particularly benefiting smaller and rural borrowers.
The ULI platform, with its standardized APIs, will simplify technical integrations and reduce the need for extensive documentation, making credit delivery quicker and more efficient.
It is designed for a plug-and-play approach to enable quicker access.
ULI improves digital access from diverse sources for lenders. The ecosystem is based on the
consent of potential borrowers and data privacy is protected
Benefits
ULI will address the large unmet demand for credit, especially in agriculture and MSME sectors, by digitizing access to financial and non-financial data currently housed in separate systems.
Experts claim that the combined impact of JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhar, Mobile), UPI, and ULI as a significant advancement in India's digital infrastructure.
Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
UPI is a system that powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating bank).
It does so by merging several banking features, seamless fund routing & merchant payments into one hood.
In other words, UPI is an interface via which one can transfer money between bank accounts across a single window.
It was launched in 2016, by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

guilty
in exchange for some concession
from the prosecutor or the court.
The concession could be a
reduced sentence, a lesser charge
, dropping some charges, or any other agreement that benefits the defendant.
The aim of plea bargaining is to
resolve a criminal case without going to trial
, thereby saving time, resources, and expenses for both the prosecution and the defendant.
Plea Bargaining in India:
It was incorporated into the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973 in 2005.
It applies only to offences punishable by
up to seven years of imprisonment
, with further restrictions
excluding cases involving crimes against women, children, or socio-economic offences
can take place at any stage
of the criminal justice process, from the initial charge to the trial itself.
The process of plea bargaining in India is
initiated by the accused by filing an application before the court
expressing his willingness to plead guilty.
The court then examines the application and
may allow or reject
it based on the facts and circumstances of the case.
If the court allows the application, it will
refer the matter to the prosecutor
for further negotiations.
During the negotiation process, the
prosecutor may offer a reduced sentence
or some other concession in exchange for the accused's guilty plea.
accused may accept or reject the offer
, and if accepted, the court will record the plea of guilt and pronounce the sentence as per the terms of the plea-bargaining agreement.
the discretion to accept or reject the plea-bargaining agreement
if it deems it to be unjust, unreasonable, or contrary to the interest of justice.
Additionally,
if the accused breaches the terms
of the plea-bargaining agreement, the
court may set aside the agreement
proceed with the trial.
accused has the right to withdraw the plea
at any time before the court pronounces the sentence. If the plea is withdrawn, the trial continues as if the plea-bargaining process had not occurred.
Once the sentence is pronounced, it becomes final
, and the accused cannot appeal against it except on the grounds of manifest injustice.

**********Polio vaccine triggered the infection in a child in Meghalaya
Why in news?
A two-year-old child in Meghalaya’s West Garo Hills district tested positive for polio, a highly infectious viral disease that has been largely eradicated due to vaccination.
The Union health ministry clarified that the case is "
vaccine-derived"
and does not threaten India's polio-free status. However, officials remain vigilant to prevent any potential spread of the infection.
What’s in today’s article?
Vaccine-derived Polio
About
Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious viral disease caused by the poliovirus.
It primarily affects young children and can lead to severe health complications, including paralysis, muscle weakness, and even death.
The virus spreads mainly through contaminated food and water or contact with an infected person.
Symptoms of poliovirus
While most polio infections are asymptomatic, a small percentage can cause paralysis by attacking the nervous system.
The symptoms can include fatigue, fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation, sore throat, neck stiffness, pain or tingling sensations in the arms and legs, severe headaches, and sensitivity to light, also known as photophobia.
Types
There are three types of poliovirus: wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) and wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3).
Polio in India
Polio was once a major public health challenge in India, with thousands of children affected by the disease each year.
India launched the Pulse Polio immunization program in 1995 to eradicate polio from the world.
The program was part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), which was launched in 1988 by the WHO, national governments, and other organizations.
The program's goal was to achieve 100% coverage by administering polio drops to children ages 0–5 across the country on a single day.
Through mass immunization drives, known as
Pulse Polio campaigns
, and the relentless efforts of health workers, India successfully reduced polio cases dramatically.
India was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014, after going three consecutive years without any new cases of wild poliovirus.
The country continues to maintain high levels of vigilance, with ongoing immunization efforts to prevent the re-emergence of the disease, particularly from vaccine-derived strains.
Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a strain linked to the weakened live virus used in the oral polio vaccine (OPV).
While OPV is largely safe and has successfully eradicated polio in most countries, it can, in rare cases, cause the disease in children with weak immune systems.
According to experts, OPV can lead to vaccine-derived infections in two ways:
the weakened virus may circulate among children, eventually regaining its ability to cause severe infection, or
it can cause chronic infection in immunocompromised children, replicating in their gut and slowly regaining its virulence.
The recent polio case in Meghalaya appears to be an example of the latter.
It is easier to control further spread of such vaccine derived variants because the other children in the area are likely fully immunized.
One in every 150,000 children given the OPV in India is infected by it.
Even if children in an area where such a case is reported are completely vaccinated, health workers have to immunise them once again as a preventive measure.
Detection of vaccine-derived polio cases in India
India’s last reported case of wild poliovirus (i.e. the infection caused by the naturally occurring version of the virus) was detected in West Bengal’s Howrah district in 2011.
India was declared
polio-free in 2014 after successfully preventing any wild polio infections for three years
However, during this period vaccine derived polio cases have continued to be reported.
An eleven-month-old immunodeficient child from Maharashtra’s Beed district succumbed to vaccine derived polio in 2013.
Multiple other cases of vaccine-derived polio have been reported from across the country, with the most recent case (prior to the one in Meghalaya) being reported in Kerala in July 2024.
These cases do not affect India’s polio-free status — only the detection of the wild poliovirus will change that
Injectable Polio Vaccine (IPV) as a tool to prevent the spread of vaccine-derived polio
The Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) is highly effective in preventing the spread of poliovirus and has been central to the global polio eradication efforts due to its ease of administration.
However, in rare cases, OPV can cause the infection and spread it to others.
This has led some experts to recommend switching to the Injectable Polio Vaccine (IPV), which does not carry the risk of vaccine-derived polio because it contains no live virus.
However, IPV has its own challenges:
it requires trained personnel to administer, which could lower immunization rates, and
does not prevent the transmission of the virus from person to person
High levels of immunization are crucial to prevent outbreaks.
Use of IPV in India
While countries like Canada and the US have fully adopted IPV, India uses both vaccines—IPV during routine immunization and OPV during Pulse Polio Days.
Experts note that India uses IPV sub-optimally, administering only one shot compared to the three shots and a booster used in other countries, necessitating the continued use of OPV to maintain immunity levels.

**********On the unrest in the Balochistan region
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Importance of Balochistan for India;
Why in the News?
The recent protests are a significant part of Balochistan’s long history of political struggles. They highlight the difficulties Pakistan faces in creating a country based solely on religion.
Causes and Reasons for the Recent Protests in Balochistan:
Balochistan has a long history of
resistance against central authority,
dating back to the
forced accession of the region to Pakistan in 1948.
Political Discontentment:
The continued
centralization of power, lack of genuine federalism, and repeated dismissals of provincial governments
have fueled discontent.
Economic Neglect
: Despite being
rich in resources like copper, gold, coal, and natural gas,
Balochistan remains one of the
poorest regions
in Pakistan. The benefits of resource exploitation have
not trickled down
to the local population
, exacerbating feelings of economic injustice.
Cultural and Ethnic Identity
: Balochistan has a
distinct cultural and historical identity,
which has often clashed with the central government due to
assimilation policies.
Human Rights Violations
: The region has seen widespread reports of e
nforced disappearances, custodial killings, and fake encounters
as part of Pakistan’s counter-insurgency strategy.
China’s Role in the Region:
Gwadar Port and Militarization Concerns
: The Gwadar port, leased to a
Chinese firm for 40 years, has raised fears of potential militarization,
which could
disrupt local livelihoods,
especially those of the fishing communities.
The presence of Chinese trawlers has also sparked protests due to concerns about illegal fishing.
CPEC influence
influx of non-locals into Balochistan
for CPEC-related projects has led to
fears of demographic changes
, further alienating the local population.
Indian perspective:
Strategic Implications
: India’s interest in Balochistan primarily stems from the region’s strategic importance, given
its location and the Gwadar port’s proximity to the Strait of Hormuz.
Diplomatic Stance
: India has occasionally highlighted human rights issues in Balochistan, especially in international forums, as a
counter-narrative to Pakistan’s stance on Kashmir.
However, India’s involvement remains cautious to
avoid escalating tensions
with Pakistan.
Impact on Regional Stability
: The unrest in Balochistan, coupled with Chinese involvement, complicates the
security situation in South Asia
India’s approach will likely
focus on balancing its strategic interests
while advocating for the
rights of the Baloch people
within international norms.
Way forward: (What should India do?)
Diplomatic Advocacy
should continue to highlight human rights issues
in Balochistan at international forums, positioning itself as a defender of human rights while
maintaining a balanced approach to avoid escalating tensions with Pakistan.
Strategic Monitoring
: India should
closely monitor developments in Balochistan,
particularly regarding
Chinese activities
in the Gwadar port, to safeguard its strategic interests and regional stability.
Mains PYQ:
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is viewed as a cardinal subset of China’s larger ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative. Give a brief description of CPEC and enumerate the reasons why India has distanced itself from the same. (150 Words, 10 Marks)

**********Crime, health-worker safety, and a self-examination 
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues in the healthcare sector;
Why in the News?
The responses to the issue of health-worker safety continue to be reactive and oversimplified, potentially indicating a lack of full understanding of the deeper underlying problems.
Deeper problem in the Health Care Sector:
Healthcare Violence:
The protests by resident doctors stem from a
series of violent attacks against medical personnel.
This violence often
arises from disgruntled patients and their families
who perceive poor healthcare services.
Corruption in Healthcare:
World Health Organization
estimates that corruption claims
nearly $455 billion
annually, which could otherwise
extend universal health coverage globally
In India, this corruption
manifests in various forms, including bribery and sextortion,
further undermining the healthcare system’s integrity.
Ineffective Responses:
Traditional responses to healthcare violence, such as
enhancing security and legal measures,
have proven inadequate. These knee-jerk reactions
fail to address the root causes of the violence.
Need to Rethink Violence in Healthcare:
Understanding the Multi-faceted Nature of Violence:
Violence in healthcare settings is
not limited to patient assaults
on healthcare workers, it also includes
institutional and managerial violence.
This encompasses
horizontal violence among healthcare providers
and the systemic issues that create a hostile work environment.
Implementing Comprehensive Safety Measures:
While immediate responses such as
improving security and legal protections
are necessary, they must be part of a broader strategy that includes training healthcare workers on c
onflict resolution, mental health support,
creating a culture of safety
within healthcare institutions.
A proper probe alone can ensure timely justice:
During Investigation:
A thorough and unbiased probe is essential to uncover the root causes of incidents, ensuring that all aspects, including systemic corruption and institutional failures, are addressed.
Swift and transparent investigations lead to timely justice, which serves as a deterrent against future crimes, reinforcing public trust in the justice system.
Need for Long-Term Reforms:
A proper probe not only ensures justice for the immediate case but also paves the way for necessary reforms in the healthcare sector, helping to prevent similar occurrences in the future.
Need for a Comprehensive Approach:
National Task Force:
Improving hospital security and infrastructure alone
may not be sufficient to address
the problem
The national task force constituted by the
Supreme Court should devise a comprehensive road
map to prevent and arrest medical corruption, particularly in the public sector.
Need Expertise:
The task force should include experts from
public health, medico-legal,
other allied fields,
along with the participation of the larger governing and administrative community.
Mains PYQ:
Appropriate local community level healthcare intervention is a prerequisite to achieve ‘Health for All’ in India. Explain.
(UPSC CSE 2018)
We are witnessing increasing instances of sexual violence against women in the country. Despite existing legal provisions against it, the number of such incidences is on the rise. Suggest some innovative measures to tackle this menace.

Continuity in Governance:
Simultaneous elections can prevent the
frequent imposition of the Model Code of Conduct,
which
disrupts government development activities
and decision-making processes.
Reduced Election Fatigue:
Voters, political parties, and the administration could benefit from reduced election fatigue, allowing them to
focus more on governance and development
Uniformity in Policy Implementation:
Central and state governments
can work in sync on policy implementation
without the hindrance of upcoming elections in various states.
Constitutional Challenges:
The implementation of simultaneous elections would require significant amendments to the Constitution, particularly
Articles 83, 85, 172, and 174,
which deal with the duration of legislative bodies.
Federalism Concerns:
Opponents argue that
simultaneous elections could undermine the federal structure of India
, marginalizing regional parties and giving
dominance to national parties.
Voter Disengagement:
The synchronization of elections might lead to voter disengagement due to the overwhelming nature of combined elections, where
national issues may overshadow regional ones.
Key Recommendations of High-Level Committee
High-Level Committee on Simultaneous Elections
, chaired by
former President Ram Nath Kovind,
has made several significant recommendations aimed at synchronizing elections for the
Lok Sabha, state assemblies, and local bodies in India.
Amendment to Article 82A:
Allow the President to set an
‘Appointed Date’
for starting simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies
Term Synchronization:
States with elections
between June 2024 and May 2029 would have their terms end with the 18th Lok Sabha,
enabling the first simultaneous elections in 2029
Premature Dissolution Measures:
Fresh elections only for the
remaining term until the next simultaneous elections
in case of early dissolution of Parliament or state Assembly
Synchronization of Local Body Elections:
Parliament to pass legislation to align
municipalities and panchayats elections with General Elections within 100 days
Single Electoral Roll:
The committee advocates for a
single electoral roll applicable to all tiers o
government,
which would
require an amendment to Article 325.
This aims to reduce redundancy and duplication in voter registration.
Logistical Arrangements:
ECI to provide
detailed logistical and expenditure plans
for simultaneous elections in coordination with SECs.
Way forward:
Constitutional and Legal Reforms:
Begin with
phased constitutional amendments and legal reforms
to address the challenges of synchronization while ensuring that the federal structure and democratic principles are preserved.
Pilot Implementation:
Consider
piloting simultaneous elections in a few states
with synchronized local body elections to assess feasibility, logistical challenges, and public response before scaling up to the national level by 2029.

sounds, connected by a tube to earpieces.
Electronic Stethoscope (Stethophone)
: Amplifies body sounds electronically and may include recording capabilities and additional diagnostics such as electrocardiograms. These devices
transmit sound data to smartphones or other devices.
Weighing Scale
Measures body weight.
Spring Scale
: Uses a spring under a plate; weight is measured by the degree of
spring compression or extension.
Requires calibration to account for local gravity variations.
Electronic Scale
: Converts the
mechanical force of weight into electrical signals using load cells or strain gauges,
displayed as weight readings on a digital screen.
Sphygmomanometer
Measures blood pressure.
Manual Sphygmomanometer
: Includes an inflatable cuff, linked to a mercury or aneroid manometer. Uses a stethoscope to
detect blood flow sounds (Korotkov sounds)
for determining systolic and diastolic pressures.
Electronic Sphygmomanometer
: Uses oscillometric technology to sense pressure oscillations caused by
arterial blood flow, automating blood pressure
measurement. Easier for home use but may have accuracy issues in patients with certain cardiovascular conditions.
