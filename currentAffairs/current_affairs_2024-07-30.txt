About Lok Adalat
Lok Adalat:
Background:
National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has been constituted under the
Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987,
and the
Chief Justice of India
is the Patron-in-Chief of NALSA.
It aims to provide
free Legal Services
to the weaker sections of the society and
to organise Lok Adalats
for amicable settlement of disputes.
Hence, the Lok Adalats have been given
statutory status
under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.
About:
Lok Adalat as the very name suggests means
people’s court
(Lok - people, Adalat - court).
It is one of the
alternative dispute redressal mechanisms
, a forum where disputes or cases are settled or compromised amicably.
In a nutshell, it is a form of
party-based
(parties involved in the dispute) justice in which people and judges work together to resolve problems by
discussion, persuasion and mutual consent
, in order to provide
affordable and timely justice.
Organization of Lok Adalat:
The State authority or district authority or the High Court legal services committee or Tehsil legal services committee (as the case may be) may organize Lok Adalat at such intervals and places as it thinks fit.
National Lok Adalats
are held at regular intervals, with Lok Adalats held throughout the country on a single day, in all courts from the Supreme Court to the Taluk Levels, where cases are disposed of in large numbers.
Composition:
Every Lok Adalat organised for an area shall consist of -
Serving or retired judicial officers.
Other persons as may be specified by the state/district authority or the High Court/Tehsil legal services committee or as the case may be, organising such Lok Adalats.
The persons deciding the cases in the Lok Adalats are called the
Members of the Lok Adalats.
Role played by these members:
They have the
role of statutory conciliators only
and do not have any judicial role.
This means, they can
only persuade
(and shall not pressurize or coerce) the parties.
As a result, the Lok Adalat will not decide the subject on its own initiative, but rather on the basis of a
compromise or settlement
reached between the parties.
The members will assist the parties in reaching an amicable settlement of their dispute in an
unbiased and impartial way
Types of cases at Lok Adalat:
Transfer or change of land title cases, compoundable criminal offences, family disputes, encroachment on forest lands, land acquisition disputes, motor accident claims and cases which are not sub-judice.
Provided that the Lok Adalat shall have no jurisdiction in respect of any matter or case relating to an offence not compoundable (can’t be quashed) under any law.
Powers:
Under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 -
Lok Adalats shall have jurisdiction to determine and to arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties to a dispute in respect of -
Any case pending before the court.
Any matter which is falling within the jurisdiction of and is not brought before any court for which the Lok Adalat is organised (pre-litigation stage).
The award (decision) made by the Lok Adalats is deemed to be
a decree of a civil court.
Such award is
final and binding
on all parties and
no appeal
against such an award lies before any court of law.
However, in exercising their right to litigate, the parties involved are free to approach the court with relevant jurisdiction and file a case by following the required procedure.
Court fee:
There is
no court fee
payable when a matter is filed in a Lok Adalat.
The court fee originally paid in the court on the complaints or petition is also
refunded back
to the parties if a matter pending in the court of law is referred to the Lok Adalat and is later settled.
Difference between Lok Adalat and a law court:
In general, Lok Adalat is not a court in the traditional sense.
a forum established by the people or interested parties
such as legal aid providers and public-spirited individuals to allow ordinary residents to air their grievances against state agencies or other citizens and seek an equitable resolution.

**********Delhi joins Quad on Ukraine war
Why in news?
Quad Ministerial Meeting was held recently in Tokyo. After the meeting, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa released a joint statement.
They expressed their enthusiasm for the
upcoming Quad summit in India
, highlighting the importance of the summit in strengthening their collaborative efforts. The ministers reiterated their commitment to advancing a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region and emphasized the importance of their partnership in addressing regional and global challenges.
The joint statement underscored the shared values and strategic interests of the Quad nations.
What’s in today’s article?
Key highlights of the Quad Ministerial Meeting
About
The grouping of
four democracies
–
India, Australia, US and Japan
– is known as the quadrilateral security dialogue or quad.
The aim of this grouping is to
ensure a free and open international order based on the rule of law in the Indo- Pacific
Objectives
The group’s
primary objectives include
maritime security,
combating the Covid-19 crisis, especially vis-à-vis vaccine diplomacy,
addressing the risks of climate change,
creating an ecosystem for investment in the region and
boosting technological innovation.
Evolution of Quad
Following the Indian Ocean tsunami, India, Japan, Australia, and the US created an
informal alliance to collaborate on disaster relief efforts
Quad as a formal group was
first mooted by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2007
However,
due to Chinese resistance and reluctance shown by India
, it could not move ahead.
Later, during the
2017 ASEAN Summits
, all
four former members re-joined negotiations to revive the quadrilateral alliance
The Quad was
upgraded to the ministerial level in September 2019
In March 2021, the first-ever summit of QUAD leaders took place virtually.
It was participated by the PMs/Presidents of all the member countries. The summit was hosted by US.
Later, in September 2021, the first in-person meeting of Quad leaders was hosted by the US.
Divergences between India and the remaining Quad members
Divergences between India and the remaining Quad members US, Japan and Australia
over Russia and bilateral differences over the Pannun assassination plot
have cast a shadow on the grouping.
With Beijing as the principal challenge, Quad is trying to paper over the differences and make a case for cooperation.
India to host Quad Leaders’ Summit in 2024
Ministers reaffirmed that India will host Quad Leaders’ Summit in 2024 and USA will host the next Quad Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in 2025.
On Ukraine War
The participating leaders expressed their deepest concern over the war raging in Ukraine, and flagged respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.
This was a clear reference to Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Significantly, this formulation of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity is not used by India in its national statements on the Russia-Ukraine war.
The negative impacts of the war in Ukraine with regard to global food and energy security, especially for developing and least developed countries, was also highlighted.
Free and open Indo-Pacific
The Quad leaders reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.
They vowed to work towards a region where no country dominates others and each state is free from coercion in all its forms.
This was a veiled reference to China’s aggressive behaviour in the region.
Achievements of Quad highlighted
Leaders also listed the outcomes from the Quad meeting including:
the Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness initiative that links information fusion centres;
the Open-RAN (Radio Access Network) deployed in Palau;
a space-based climate warning system to be launched in Mauritius, and
off-grid solar projects in the Indo-Pacific.

**********Centre likely to Lodge Complaint against ILO’s India Employment Report
Why in the News?
India, a founding member of the International Labour Organization (ILO), is likely to raise a complaint against the UN agency over its
India Employment Report 2024
, released in March this year.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About ILO (Background, Objectives, etc.)
India Employment Report (Key Highlights of the 2024 edition)
About International Labour Organisation:
The ILO was created in 1919, as part of the
Treaty of Versailles
that ended World War I, to reflect the belief that universal and lasting peace can be accomplished only if it’s based on social justice.
In 1946, the ILO became a
specialized agency of the United Nations
The ILO is
devoted to promoting social justice and internationally recognized human and labour rights, pursuing its founding mission that labour peace is essential to prosperity
Headquarters:
Geneva, Switzerland
Objectives of ILO:
The ILO has
four strategic objectives
Promote and realize standards and fundamental principles and rights at work,
Create greater opportunities for women and men to decent employment and income,
Enhance the coverage and effectiveness of social protection for all, and
Strengthen tripartism and social dialogue.
Membership of ILO:
187
state members.
India is a
founding member of the ILO
and it has been a permanent member of the ILO Governing Body since 1922.
The ILO constitution permits any member of the UN to become a member of the ILO.
To gain membership, a nation must inform the director-general that it accepts all the obligations of the ILO constitution.
About India Employment Report 2024:
The India Employment Report 2024 is the third in the series of regular publications by the
Institute for Human Development on labour and employment issues
It is undertaken in partnership with the
(ILO).
The report examines the challenge of youth employment in the context of the emerging economic, labour market, educational and skills scenarios in India and the changes witnessed over the past two decades
the report highlights recent trends in the Indian labour market, which indicate improvements in some outcomes along with persisting and new challenges, including those generated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Key Highlights of the India Employment Report 2024:
The report is primarily based on analysis of data from the National Sample Surveys and the Periodic Labour Force Surveys between 2000 and 2022.
Employment Trends & Current Scenario
The female labour market participation rate, after declining significantly in the earlier years, took to a faster upward trend as of 2019, particularly in rural areas.
One of the most significant features of the Indian labour market is a
slow and steady transition of the workforce away from agriculture and into the non-farm sectors
Employment in India is predominantly self-employment and casual employment.
Nearly 82 per cent of the workforce engages in the informal sector, and nearly 90 per cent is informally employed
While wages of casual labourers maintained a modest upward trend during 2012–22, real wages of regular workers either remained stagnant or declined.
There are large variations between states in their employment outcomes, which are captured through the employment condition index prepared for this report.
The migration levels in India are not adequately captured through official surveys.
The rates of urbanization and migration are expected to considerably increase in the future.
India is expected to have a migration rate of around 40 per cent in 2030 and will have an urban population of around 607 million
Challenges of Youth Employment
A large proportion of the population is of working age, and India is expected to be in the potential demographic dividend zone for at least another decade.
But the country is at an inflexion point because the youth population, at 27 per cent of the total population in 2021, is expected to decline to 23 per cent by 2036.
Each year, around 7–8 million youths are added to the labour force
whose productive utilization could lead to India reaping a demographic dividend.
Youth participation in the labour market has been much lower than among adults and was on a long-term (2000–19) declining trend, primarily due to greater participation in education.
Youth unemployment increased nearly threefold, from 5.7 per cent in 2000 to 17.5 per cent in 2019 but declined to 12.1 per cent in 2022
After the lockdowns, the youth labour market indicators recovered quite quickly.
But this movement was accompanied by additions to the labour force and workforce, primarily in poor-quality work.
Suggestions
The report highlights five key policy areas for further action, which apply more generally and also specifically for youth in India:
promoting job creation;
improving employment quality;
addressing labour market inequalities;
strengthening skills and active labour market policies; and
bridging the knowledge deficits on labour market patterns and youth employment.
Centre likely to Lodge Complaint against ILO’s India Employment Report:
The Indian government plans to lodge a complaint against the International Labour Organization (ILO) over its India Employment Report 2024.
Union Labour Ministry official criticized the ILO's model as unsuitable for India, stating that India's own assessments and data provide a more accurate picture
The ILO report, prepared with the Institute of Human Development, highlighted that 83% of India's unemployed are youth, with a significant increase in the share of educated young people among the unemployed.
The Labour Ministry has expressed concerns over the ILO's data sources and
emphasized the importance of employment generation and improving employability through government initiatives

**********Report on Currency and Finance (RCF) 2023-24
Why in News?
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the Report on Currency and Finance (RCF) for the year 2023-24 with the theme -
India’s Digital Revolution
.
What’s in Today’s Article?
India’s Digital Revolution - Highlights of the RCF
Significance of the Digitalisation in Finance in India
Challenges Posed by the Digitalisation in Finance
Remittances in India - Highlights of the RCF
Way Forward for a Robust Digital Finance Ecosystem in India
India’s Digital Revolution - Highlights of the RCF:
India is leading the global digital revolution
, emerging as a frontrunner on the back of its robust digital public infrastructure (DPI), rapidly evolving institutional arrangements, and a growing tech-savvy population.
Globally, India ranks first
in biometric-based identification (Aadhaar) and real-time payments volume; second in telecom subscribers; and third in terms of the startup ecosystem.
The flagship Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
has revolutionised the retail payment experience for end users, making transactions faster and more convenient.
In the digital currency arena
, the RBI is at the forefront with pilot runs of the e-rupee, the central bank digital currency (CBDC).
The digital lending ecosystem
is becoming vibrant with initiatives such as the Open Credit Enablement Network, the Open Network for Digital Commerce and the Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit.
FinTechs are collaborating with banks
and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) as lending service providers.
They are also operating platforms to facilitate digital credit.
Significance of the Digitalisation in Finance in India:
Paving the way for next-generation banking:
For example, loans in the retail segment are being enabled by online payments and innovative credit assessment models with instant disbursements.
Innovations are making financial markets more efficient, integrated and inclusive:
By -
Improving access to financial services at affordable costs;
Enhancing the impact of direct benefit transfers (DBTs) by effective targeting of beneficiaries in a cost-efficient manner; and
Boosting E-commerce through embedded finance.
On the external front:
Digitalisation is driving growth in India’s services exports and lowering remittance costs.
Transforming DPI as a global public good:
For example, the RBI has joined
Project Nexus
- a multilateral international initiative to enable instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic Fast Payments System (FPS).
As part of the project, the country’s UPI and FPSs of Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand will be interlinked through Nexus.
Challenges Posed by the Digitalisation in Finance:
Customer protection:
It presents challenges related to
cybersecurity, data privacy, data bias
, vendor and third-party risks.
Complex products and business models:
Emerging technologies can introduce such models with risks that users may not fully understand, including the proliferation of
fraudulent apps and mis-selling
through dark patterns.
Human resource challenges:
Digitalisation may induce human resource challenges in the financial sector, necessitating strategic investments in upskilling and reskilling.
Remittances in India - Highlights of the RCF:
Highest remittance recipient in the world:
According to the World Bank, global remittances are estimated to have increased to US$ 857.3 billion in 2023.
This is led by
India (US$ 115.3 billion -
accounting for 13.5% of the world total
, Mexico (US$ 66.2 billion), China (US$ 49.5 billion) and the Philippines (US$ 39.1 billion).
The cost of sending remittances
globally has decreased over time, with digitalisation playing a key role.
Trends in India:
In 2021,
more than half of India’s inward remittances were from the Gulf countries
, while North America accounted for 22% share.
The ratio of remittances to GDP
for India has gradually increased from 2.8% in 2000 to 3.2% in 2023. It is now above that of gross FDI inflows to GDP ratio (1.9% in 2023), providing strength to India’s external sector.
Future projections:
Going forward, India is poised to be the world’s leading supplier of labour as its working-age population is expected to rise until 2048, while it has started dwindling for major advanced economies.
This will propel remittances
to around $160 billion in 2029 from $115 billion in 2023,
and propel skill upgradation of the workforce
Way Forward for a Robust Digital Finance Ecosystem in India:
Regulatory and supervisory frameworks
must scale up and become more sophisticated to balance financial stability, customer protection and competition.
the Government of India has introduced
the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023
to fortify the protection of personal data in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.
The goal is to balance effective regulation with fostering financial innovations in a safe, robust and trustworthy ecosystem.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About Machine Unlearning (MUL)
Mains level:
Significance of Machine Unlearning (MUL)
Why in the news?
The emergence of artificial intelligence has revolutionized various facets of our lives and has even prompted us to reevaluate our concepts of the mind, brain, and consciousness.
Antithesis of Machine Learning (ML):
is considered the antithesis of Machine Learning (ML). It was first proposed by
Cao and Yang in their work “Towards Making Systems Forget with Machine Unlearning.”
Machine Unlearning focuses on the ability to make AI models forget specific data they have learned. This concept addresses the challenges of removing or correcting sensitive, false, incorrect, or outdated information from trained AI models.
While ML is about learning from data to make predictions or decisions, MUL aims to reverse this process, ensuring that certain data can be effectively and completely erased from the models.
This concept is crucial for maintaining
data privacy, reducing AI bias,
complying with regulations
that require the deletion of personal or sensitive information.
Implementation approaches
Private Approach:
Data fiduciaries voluntarily implement MUL algorithms, allowing flexibility but potentially limiting access for smaller companies due to cost and expertise barriers.
Public Approach:
Governments can legislate requirements for MUL implementation, potentially creating a standard framework that data fiduciaries must follow. This can include guidelines under existing data protection laws, as seen in the EU’s AI Act, which addresses data poisoning and mandates security controls.
International Approach:
This emphasizes the need for a global framework for MUL, recognizing that AI innovations have cross-border implications. International standard-setting organizations could play a crucial role in developing these standards
Techniques for Machine Unlearning
Exact Unlearning:
This method completely removes the influence of specific data points from the model.
Approximate Unlearning:
Instead of fully erasing the data’s influence, this technique minimizes its impact on the model’s predictions to an acceptable level.
Data-Centric Approaches:
Techniques like data reorganization and pruning are employed to manage the dataset, making it easier to identify and remove unwanted data points.
Model-Centric Approaches:
These methods involve manipulating the model parameters directly. For example, algorithms can adjust the weights associated with the data points that need to be forgotten, thereby reducing their influence on the model’s outputs.
Prompting-Based Methods:
In large language models (LLMs), developers can use carefully crafted prompts to induce behaviours that mimic unlearning.
Algorithmic Innovations:
New algorithms, such as MU-Mis, focus on minimizing the contribution of specific data points to the model’s decision-making process.
Way forward:
Development of Standardized Frameworks:
The need to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for MUL can facilitate its adoption across various sectors. Governments and international organizations should collaborate to create guidelines that mandate the use of MUL techniques for data privacy compliance, similar to the
EU’s AI Act.
Investment in Research and Education:
The need to increase funding and resources should be directed toward research in machine unlearning techniques and their applications.

Mains level:
Drug issues in India
Why in the news?
Telangana faces a drug crisis, with Hyderabad as a transit hub. Marijuana is trafficked via Konark Express to Maharashtra and Karnataka, per police reports.
The Gravity of the Drug Problem in Telangana
Hyderabad has emerged as a transit hub for drugs, with marijuana being ferried through the city to be supplied to neighbouring states like
Maharashtra and Karnataka.
The number of people charge-sheeted for drug possession and peddling increased from
735 in 2020 to 3,052 in 2022
. In the
first six months of 2023, nearly 1,900 cases
were lodged against peddlers and users.
An
international drug ring was busted in February 2023, seizing ₹8 crore worth
of synthetic psychedelics like
OG Kush and Ecstasy pills.
Drug abuse has been found among students in
top medical and management colleges
Hyderabad.
Initiatives taken by the State Government
Drug Detection Kits
: Officials use the latest technology, including
12-panel drug tests
, to instantly identify drug abuse among party attendees and students.
Special Operations
: Operations such as checking attendees at
Electronic Dance Music parties
conducting tests on students in colleges
have been carried out.
Use of Sniffer Dogs
: Sniffer dogs are deployed in
pubs and transit hubs
to detect contraband.
Legal and Technological Actions
: The Telangana
Anti-Narcotics Bureau
sent cease and desist notices to firms manufacturing ganja-laced chocolates shipped via e-commerce platforms.
Political Will
: Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has shown political will by advocating for awareness among politicians and celebrities, although this has led to legal disputes.
Legal Status of Marijuana
General Prohibition:
Marijuana, including its various forms
such as ganja (flower), charas (resin), and hashish, is illegal under
the NDPS Act.
It talks about the possession, sale, and production of these substances are
criminal offences.
Bhang Exception:
Bhang, made from the
leaves and seeds of the cannabis plant
legally consumed
in many parts of India, especially during religious festivals. It is
not classified
as an illegal substance under the
State Variations:
Different states have their own regulations regarding cannabis. For example,
Uttarakhand
legalized the commercial cultivation of hemp
, while
Odisha
has a
more lenient approach to recreational use.
This leads to a patchwork of laws across the country.
Penalties:
The NDPS Act prescribes severe penalties for drug offences.
Possession of small quantities can lead to
imprisonment of six months to one year and fines of up to ₹10,000
. For larger quantities, penalties can escalate to
10-20 years of imprisonment and fines of ₹1-2 lakh.
Requires Smart thinking and Policing (Way forward)
Focus on Trade, Not Users
: The emphasis should be on dismantling the drug network rather than just catching users. This approach was advocated by Home Minister Amit Shah.
Avoiding Witch Hunts
: The fight against drugs should not lead to the targeting of specific localities or public shaming of institutions.
Need Economic Considerations
: Measures such as shutting down nightlife venues before midnight could harm the economy and the business environment.
Implement Integrated Approach
: A comprehensive strategy is needed that involves smarter policing, better use of technology, and effective legal actions against producers and suppliers rather than users.
Mains PYQ:
India’s proximity to two of the world’s biggest illicit opium-growing states has enhanced her internal security concerns. Explain the linkages between drug trafficking and other illicit activities such as gunrunning, money laundering and human trafficking. What countermeasures should be taken to prevent the same?

Internal Security; Developments in Militancy (2014-2024)
Why in the News?
An ambush resulted in the deaths of five Indian Army personnel  which highlights a worrying trend of increasing violence in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in the Jammu region.
This incident marks the fourth terror attack in the state within a span of 48 hours, indicating a surge in militant activities.
Observations on Militancy Leading to Civilian Deaths
The new wave of terrorism:
The region has seen a resurgence of violence after a period of relative peace, with notable incidents such as the June 9 attack on a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims, resulting in nine deaths. This shift in militancy is particularly concerning as it reflects a new wave of terrorism, especially in areas like Rajouri and Poonch, which had previously been stable.
Changing dynamics of Terrorism:
There is a notable transition from foreign terrorists leading attacks to local militants becoming more prominent.
Surge in Violence Post-2016:
The killing of
Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani in July 2016
sparked widespread unrest and violence, leading to a resurgence in militant activities. This period saw
increased recruitment of local youth into militant ranks
, particularly within groups like
Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.
Major Attacks:
Notable incidents include the
2016 Uri attack, where militants killed 19 soldiers,
and the
2019 Pulwama attack
resulted in the deaths of 40 CRPF personnel.
These attacks highlighted the persistent threat posed by organized militant groups.
Revocation of Article 370:
abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019
led to a significant shift in the political landscape. While the Indian government claimed a reduction in violence, there were still notable attacks, such as the
Emergence of Hybrid Militancy:
A new trend termed
“hybrid militancy”
has emerged, where individuals
engage in militant activities sporadically while maintaining their civilian lives.
Decline in Active Militants:
By the end of 2022, the number of active militants had fallen to just over 100, down from around 250 in 2019. However, the presence of foreign militants has reportedly increased, indicating a shift in the composition of militant forces.
Increased Counter-Insurgency Operations:
The Indian security forces have intensified operations against militants,
resulting in the deaths of approximately 750 militants
over the last four years, with a significant proportion being local youths.
Changing Tactics and Technology:
Militants have
increasingly utilized modern technology, including drones and social media
, to coordinate attacks and recruit members, presenting new challenges for security forces.
Way forward:
Addressing Recruitment Cycles:
Government need to make initiatives aimed at preventing youth recruitment into militant groups. This can include educational programs, vocational training, and employment opportunities that provide alternatives to joining militant organizations.
Enhanced Intelligence and Local Engagement:
The need to Strengthen local intelligence networks is crucial to preemptively identify and disrupt militant activities.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Landslides, Landslide Atlas of India
Why in the News?
Over 50 people have died, and hundreds are feared trapped after three landslides hit Kerala’s Wayanad district.
About Wayanad
Wayanad is the
only plateau in Kerala
, forming a continuation of the Mysore Plateau, part of the Deccan Plateau.
The
Kabini River
, a tributary of the Kaveri River, originates in Wayanad.
Chaliyar River
, the fourth longest river in Kerala, also originates on the Wayanad plateau.
Wayanad is home to the
Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary
Susceptibility to Landslides:
The region predominantly has
laterite
soil, which is highly
prone to erosion
steep and undulating terrain
of Wayanad makes it naturally susceptible to landslides.
Wayanad receives
intense and prolonged monsoon rains
that cause
water infiltration
, leading to
soil saturation
increased pore water pressure
, which destabilizes slopes.
Large-scale deforestation
for agriculture and settlement reduces the binding capacity of the soil and its ability to absorb water, exacerbating the risk of landslides.
What are Landslides?
A landslide is the
downward and outward movement of materials
including rock, earth, or debris down a slope due to gravitational force.
Landslides are disasters of
hydrogeological origin
, resulting from the failure of materials falling down a slope due to gravity.
India’s Landslide Vulnerability:
India is among the
top five landslide-prone countries
globally, with at least
one death per 100 sq km
reported annually due to landslides.
Rainfall variability
single biggest cause
of landslides, particularly in the Himalayas and the Western Ghats.
Approximately
12.6% of India’s geographical land area
, excluding snow-covered areas, is prone to landslides.
Regional Distribution
North-western Himalayas
: 66.5% of landslides.
North-eastern Himalayas
: 18.8% of landslides.
: 14.7% of landslides.
Despite fewer events, landslides in the Western Ghats, especially in Kerala, significantly increase the vulnerability of inhabitants to fatalities.
Key Policy Initiative: National Landslide Susceptibility Map
National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) under ISRO
released the Landslide Atlas of India in
2023
This detailed guide identifies
landslide hotspots across
the country with a

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Scientists from the “
CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology”
have developed an enhanced genome-editing system using
that can modify DNA more precisely
and more efficiently than existing CRISPR-based technologies.
CRISPR occurs naturally in some bacteria, as a part of their immune system that limits infections by recognizing and destroying viral DNA.
What is FnCas9?
FnCas9 is a
variant of the Cas9
enzyme derived from the bacterium
Francisella novicida.
It is
used in genome editing technologies
, particularly within the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) system, to make precise modifications to DNA sequences.
What is CRISPR-Cas9 System?
CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary
genome-editing tool
adapted from a
natural bacterial defense mechanism against viruses.
Bacteria use CRISPR sequences to store segments of viral DNA
, which helps them recognize and combat viruses in subsequent infections.
The most
commonly used
Cas9 enzyme
is derived from
Streptococcus pyogenes
Mechanism:
Guide RNA (gRNA)
: A specifically designed RNA molecule that matches the target DNA sequence.
: Acts as molecular scissors that cut DNA at a location specified by the gRNA.
Proto-spacer Adjacent Motif (PAM)
: A short DNA sequence adjacent to the target site that Cas9 must recognize and bind to in order to cut the DNA.
DNA Repair
: Once the DNA is cut, the cell’s natural repair mechanisms either repair the break or introduce desired genetic changes.
Applications:
Agriculture
: Enhancing crop yield and nutritional value.
Healthcare
: Diagnosing and treating genetic disorders.
Research
: Studying gene functions and interactions.
Challenges with Traditional Cas9:
SpCas9 can sometimes cut DNA at unintended sites, leading to potential unintended genetic modifications.
How FnCas9 overpowers traditional Cas9 (SpCas9)?
FnCas9 is known for its
higher specificity
in targeting DNA sequences
compared to SpCas9, resulting in fewer off-target effects.
More accurate targeting
reduces unintended genetic modifications
It ensures
more reliable and safer
genome editing.
Achievements by Indian Scientists
Scientists at the CSIR-IGIB in New Delhi have modified FnCas9 to enhance its efficiency without compromising specificity.
Key Modifications include:
Amino Acid Tinkering
: Researchers modified amino acids in FnCas9 that interact with the PAM sequence to increase binding affinity.
Improved Binding
: Enhanced binding affinity allows FnCas9 to sit more securely on the DNA, improving gene-editing effectiveness.
Flexibility
: The enhanced FnCas9 can access and edit hard-to-reach regions of the genome.
Experimental Results:
Enhanced FnCas9 cuts target DNA at a higher rate than the unmodified version.
improved ability to detect single-nucleotide changes
in the genome, broadening its diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
