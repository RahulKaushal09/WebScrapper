India - China Relations
Why in News?
Speaking at a think tank in New York, foreign minister S Jaishankar described India-China ties as "significantly disturbed".
This comes after his recent statement claiming that the two neighbours have resolved 75% of "disengagement problems" along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.

Efforts to Break the Deadlock in the India - China Relations and Way Ahead
Evolution of the India - China Relations:
During the course of the 1990s and until 2013
Sharing the goal of avoiding another border war akin to that of 1962, India and China agreed to set aside their differences on the border and focus on their economic development.
Each involved the other on secondary issues such as terrorism or Afghanistan.
National interests began to diverge after 2013:
Coinciding with lower economic growth prospects, President Xi Jinping pursued an
assertive foreign-policy and security agenda
by -
Focusing on promoting global technology champions and its Belt and Road Initiative (
BRI
),
Acquiring advanced dual-use technologies and securitising its economy at home.
This created insecurity for India.
India has concurrently considered itself
a rising global economic force
able to leverage its strategic partnerships in Asia and beyond.
Since the end of the coronavirus pandemic, India has gained confidence from its status as the
world’s fastest growing major economy.
India’s ambitions evolved from seeking to be the ‘plus-one’ of multinationals’ China-focused strategies to being a
preferred, trusted middle-weight supplier in global supply chains
‘Make in India’
policy epitomises its ambitions to grow its services and industry, using foreign capital to eventually boost exports.
Current State of India - China Relations:
India - China ties are troubled by -
An unsettled border, an unequal trade relationship, China’s strategic ties to Pakistan
, and
A broadening political-strategic disagreement over each other’s perceived
rightful place in Asia and beyond.
The relationship has suffered from a
lack of strategic trust
since a June 2020 border clash (in the Galwan valley).
This unmined the letter and spirit of the border-management regime that had been patiently negotiated, designed and agreed to over a generation.
The war in Ukraine has brought China closer to Russia
, India’s historic defence partner.
The decline in relations is evident
by the Chinese President declining to attend the 2023 G-20 summit in New Delhi and the Indian PM’s lack of attendance at the 2024 SCO summit in Kazakhstan.
Efforts to Break the Deadlock in the India - China Relations and Way Ahead:
Resolution of disengagement problems through strategic communication:
After a hiatus of over two years, their top national-security officials met in 2022, 2023 and July 2024.
As a result, the two neighbours have
Friction points such as
Galwan Valley, north and south banks of Pangong Tso and the Gogra-Hot Springs area
have been resolved to some extent with the creation of
buffer zones
along the LAC.
However,
legacy issues of Depsang Plains and Demchok
(pre-dating the current ongoing military standoff) remains.
As a result, troops deployed at the Depsang Plains were
blocked from accessing
their patrol points in an area called the
Y junction
Deployment of troops through intensified diplomatic and military talks:
The delegation for the
31st
Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (
WMCC
) discussed the issue of deployment of troops along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.
The 22nd round of military talks
between India and China at the
Corps Commanders’ level
may set the time frame of the deployment of troops from either side based on the mutual agreement reached.
This might help the Indian troops
regain access to some of the patrolling points along the LAC
Irrespective of any deployment change, the border infrastructure development along the entire LAC will continue as per plans.
As the India - China relationship is
key to Asia's future
and will influence not just the continent but the entire world, there is the avoid any further tensions which could distract them from their peaceful rise.
One possible route is to establish new confidence-building measures.

**********Project Cheetah
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Project Cheetah (Objective, Features, etc.)
Status of Project Cheetah (Progress, Positives, Negatives, Challenges, Suggestions, etc.)
About Project Cheetah:
Project Cheetah, launched to reintroduce the African sub-species of cheetahs in India, completed two years on September 17.
The project has two primary objectives:
To establish a stable, breeding population of cheetahs in central India and
To use cheetahs as an
umbrella species
to restore open ecosystems such as scrubs, savannahs, grasslands, and degraded forests.
This was the
world’s first inter-continental large wild carnivore translocation project
The cheetah was declared extinct in India in 1952, making it the only large wild mammalian species to go extinct since India’s independence.
Funding
: Funded by
Project Tiger
and the
Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management & Planning Authority
(CAMPA)
While the project has seen marginal successes, significant challenges remain, raising questions about its long-term outlook.
Status of Cheetah Reintroduction:
The project began with the translocation of African cheetahs from
Namibia
South Africa
Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh
, in two batches of eight and twelve cheetahs.
Initially, the cheetahs were kept in soft-release enclosures called bomas, where they adapted to the local environment and hunted live prey. Mating within this cohort led to the birth of 17 cubs.
However, the
survival rate has been a concern
Of the 20 translocated cheetahs, eight (40%) have died due to various reasons, including injuries during mating and infections caused by tick infestations under their radio collars.
Of the 17 cubs born, five (29%) have also perished.
Currently, 24 cheetahs (12 adults and 12 cubs) survive
, with the next batch of 6-8 cheetahs expected to be translocated
to Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary
in Madhya Pradesh.
Challenges in Releasing Cheetahs into the Wild:
Despite initial successes in breeding and adapting to a new environment, the project faces significant hurdles in fully releasing the cheetahs into the wild.
Although two cheetahs, Pawan and Veera, were released into the wild,
Pawan’s recent death, ostensibly due to drowning, has raised concerns about their ability to establish habitats independently
Following Pawan’s death, all surviving cheetahs have been confined to enclosures, sparking criticism from conservation scientists about the delay in releasing them into the wild and a lack of transparency.
Wildlife biologists have pointed out that Namibia’s policy advises against keeping large wild carnivores in captivity for more than three months.
If not released within this timeframe, the animals should either be euthanized or held in permanent captivity.
prolonged enclosure of cheetahs, contrary to the Cheetah Action Plan, which stipulated a 4–5-week quarantine followed by a brief acclimatization period, has drawn scrutiny
Prey Scarcity:
One of the major challenges for Project Cheetah is the inadequate prey base.
The latest report indicates that the
density of chital, the primary prey for both cheetahs and leopards, has declined from 23.43 animals per square kilometer in 2021 to 17.5 in 2024
, resulting in a significant prey deficit.
The current population of approximately 6,700 chital is insufficient to sustain the 91 leopards and 12 adult cheetahs in Kuno National Park, which would require around 23,600 prey animals annually for leopards and 3,120 for cheetahs.
This prey shortage necessitates immediate intervention, including prey augmentation at Kuno and Gandhi Sagar, the next intended site for cheetah translocation.
Experts argue that the
rapid decline in prey density reflects poor project management
, especially given that Kuno was chosen specifically for its rich prey base.
Way Forward / Suggestions:
Free-ranging cheetahs have often ventured far beyond the boundaries of Kuno, crossing state lines and even entering human habitats.
Analysis of their movements using radio collars shows significant travel, with Veera moving an average of 5.82 km per day and often entering territorial forests outside the national park.
These insights underscore the
need for a comprehensive interstate landscape conservation plan
future of Project Cheetah hinges on the conservation of the interstate Kuno-Gandhi Sagar landscape
, which spans protected areas, territorial forests, and several districts in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
Achieving a stable population of 60-70 cheetahs in this region will require significant efforts in prey management, establishing interstate coordination mechanisms, and ensuring the protection of open ecosystems.
Conclusion:
Project Cheetah has made some progress in reintroducing cheetahs to India, but it faces numerous challenges, including prey scarcity, delayed releases, and the need for large-scale landscape conservation.
Moving forward, effective management, transparency, and enhanced conservation efforts will be crucial in ensuring the long-term success of the project and the sustainable revival of cheetah populations in India.

**********India joins US-led Mineral Security Network
Why in news?
India has formally joined the Minerals Security Finance Network (MSFN), a US-led initiative focused on enhancing cooperation among members to secure supply chains for critical minerals. The announcement, made by the US State Department on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, involves a pact signed by 14 countries and the European Union.
The MSFN is an extension of the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), launched by the US in 2022.
India had already joined the MSP in June 2023
What’s in today’s article?
China's strategy of restricting access to critical minerals
China blocking the access to critical minerals
On August 15, 2023, China announced restrictions on antimony exports, a critical mineral for military and defense equipment, citing "national security."
The move, effective from September 15, was part of a broader pattern of counteractions in response to global efforts to reduce reliance on Chinese minerals.
China is using its dominant position
China dominates the global supply chains for critical minerals, controlling 60% of rare earth and critical minerals production and 80% of their processing, making other nations, such as the U.S., EU, India, and Japan, strategically vulnerable.
Past instances where China weaponized its dominant position
China has previously weaponized its mineral dominance, as seen in 2010 when it halted rare earth exports to Japan after a maritime dispute.
In 2023, China imposed further export restrictions on minerals like gallium, germanium, and graphite, in retaliation against U.S. export controls on advanced technology.
These actions signal China's willingness to leverage its control over critical minerals to counter U.S.-led efforts to diversify supply chains and reduce dependency on Chinese resources.
China's actions aim to undermine Western efforts to decouple from its supply chains and hinder development in areas like submarines and fighter jets, which require large amounts of rare earth elements.
This shift marks a
departure from cooperation to coercion in China's foreign relations
, signaling that mineral export controls will intensify as tensions with the West grow.
About
In August 2022, US and 10 other nations agreed for this alliance known as MSP.
MSP is an international alliance that aims to ensure a stable supply of critical minerals for a clean energy transition.
It focuses on minerals and metals that are essential for clean energy technologies, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, graphite, rare earth elements, and copper.
Goals
Sustainable supply chains
: The MSP works to create diverse, sustainable, and responsible supply chains for critical minerals.
Economic development
: The MSP aims to ensure that the production, processing, and recycling of critical minerals supports economic development.
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards
: The MSP's members commit to high ESG standards.
Shared prosperity
: The MSP's members work to promote shared prosperity.
Members
Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Republic of Korea, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union.
Background: need for MSFN
The creation of the MSFN reflects a growing need to reduce dependence on countries like China for critical resources, particularly rare earth minerals.
Signatory nations emphasized that meeting the global demand for these minerals to support the clean energy transition requires collaboration between the public and private sectors.
MSFN is a new initiative that originates from the MSP, a framework established by the US in 2022.
The network aims to bring together institutions from the Indo-Pacific region and Europe, promoting cooperation, information exchange, and co-financing.
Under this, development finance institutions (DFIs) and export credit agencies (ECAs) from member nations will work together to enhance production capacity and resilience in mineral supply chains.
Countries that are part of this initiative
The partnership includes 14 countries and the European Commission.
These are the USA, Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the EU.
India’s participation
India’s participation in this initiative is aimed at diversifying and securing its supply of critical minerals from nations like Argentina, Chile, Australia, and select African countries.
Kazakhstan, in Central Asia, is also being explored as a potential source for India’s mineral requirements.
China dominates rare earth production, controlling about 70% of global output
, while
India seeks to establish itself in the lithium value chain
New Delhi is heavily dependent on the imports of critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and copper, which resulted in an
import cost of around ₹34,000 crore in FY23
It is estimated that India’s hunger for minerals will only grow, and so will the import cost, further increasing India’s vulnerability.
This partnership with the US-led network marks a critical step forward for India in its quest to reduce reliance on China for these minerals and build a robust, self-sustaining supply chain for its green energy initiatives.

**********How global warming affect forecasting?
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of Climate change;
Why in the News?
The record warming of 2023-2024 is offering a clearer view of the impacts of global warming. The range of extreme events experienced globally has spanned from deadly heatwaves to devastating cyclones and floods, as well as droughts and wildfires.
Impact of Warming on Predictability:
Increased Variability:
The record warming of 2023-2024 highlights the unpredictability of climate systems under
, complicating forecasts for natural phenomena like
El Niño, monsoons,
hurricanes
Natural Variability:
Warming may extend the timescale of
natural decadal variability
, making it harder to distinguish between short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in climate behaviour.
Model Limitations:
Despite advances, climate models are imperfect in capturing changes in dominant climate modes due to warming, leading to inconsistencies in predicting events like monsoon trends.
Types of Climate Models to forecast the weather:
General Circulation Models (GCMs):
These models simulate the physics of the climate system by representing the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice. They divide the Earth into a three-dimensional grid and calculate climate variables like temperature and humidity in each grid cell.
Earth System Models (ESMs):
An advanced subset of GCMs that includes biogeochemical cycles, allowing them to simulate interactions between climate and ecological processes, such as carbon and nitrogen cycles.
Regional Climate Models (RCMs):
These focus on smaller geographic areas to provide more detailed climate projections by using outputs from GCMs as inputs for localized simulations.
Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs):
These combine climate science with socioeconomic factors to analyze how human activities influence climate change and to project future emissions scenarios.
Challenges in Forecasting Extreme Weather:
Inconsistent Predictions:
Predictions for
extreme weather events in 2023
, such as the monsoon and hurricane seasons, were less accurate, revealing the limitations of current models and observational networks.
Unforeseen Factors:
Unanticipated contributions, like the impact of the
Hunga Tonga volcano or wildfire-induced CO2 emissions,
exacerbated warming in ways models failed to predict, illustrating the unpredictability of new factors.
Censorship Concerns:
The rapid response required from social media platforms to act on content flagged as misleading within
36 hours
created concerns about censorship and freedom of expression.
Future of Weather Prediction Models:
Need for Model Improvements:
There is ongoing work to refine models and incorporate the latest technologies,
including AI and machine learning
, to improve weather prediction accuracy at hyperlocal scales.
Natural Modes and Uncertainty:
The predictability of natural modes
(El Niño, La Niña, IOD)
may decrease with relentless warming, making future climate forecasts increasingly uncertain.
Short-Term Focus:
A shift toward short-term
predictions (up to a decade or two)
may offer more reliable projections due to the inherent difficulty in predicting long-term scenarios under continuous global warming.
Way forward:
Enhanced Climate Models:
Invest in improving climate models with cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning, and advanced sensors to increase the accuracy of short-term forecasts and better capture the impact of natural variability under warming.
Localized Early Warning Systems:
Develop robust, hyperlocal early warning systems to better prepare for extreme weather events, focusing on disaster management and reducing vulnerabilities in high-risk communities.
**********Taking stock of global nuclear disarmament
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to Nuclear bombs;
Why in the News?
September 26 is recognized on the United Nations calendar as the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.
What is the current state of global nuclear disarmament efforts?
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)
: The TPNW, in force since 2021, is the
first legally binding international agreement
that comprehensively bans nuclear weapons. As of July 2024, it has
70 states parties and 27 signatories yet to ratify,
covering nearly 50% of the world’s states.
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
: The NPT, in effect since 1970, remains the foundational treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and promoting eventual disarmament. However, it has been criticized for its limited focus on actual disarmament.
Persistent Objectors
: Nuclear-armed states (such as the
U.S., Russia, China, India, and Pakistan
) and their allies have consistently opposed the TPNW, refusing to be bound by its provisions.
What are the key obstacles hindering further nuclear disarmament?
Nuclear Deterrence Doctrine
: The belief in nuclear deterrence — the idea that possessing nuclear weapons prevents attacks — is a central justification for continued nuclear armament.
Nuclear-Weapon States’ Resistance
: The nuclear-armed states, including the U.S., Russia, China, India, and others, continue to view nuclear weapons as essential to their security strategies, despite claims of disarmament commitments under the NPT.
Geopolitical Conflicts
: Ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s rising military power, North Korea’s nuclear tests, and Iran’s uranium enrichment, have exacerbated the global nuclear threat, further impeding disarmament efforts.
Lack of Enforcement Mechanisms
: The TPNW, while normatively important, lacks robust enforcement mechanisms. It depends on the voluntary commitment of states, and nuclear possessors do not face direct penalties for non-compliance.
What steps can be taken to reinvigorate the nuclear disarmament agenda? (Way forward)
Strengthening International Advocacy
: Civil society, former political leaders (including NATO officials), and international organizations should continue advocating for disarmament and urging nuclear-armed states and their allies to reconsider their stance. Public pressure could create the political will for further disarmament steps.
Engagement of Non-Nuclear States
: States that are non-nuclear but support the TPNW should work to expand the treaty’s footprint, encouraging more countries to ratify and actively participate in its framework. This could help isolate nuclear possessors diplomatically and morally.
Building Confidence through Arms Control Treaties
: Reviving arms control agreements, such as the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
the New START treaty,
would be important milestones in reducing nuclear risks.
About CTBT:
Complete Ban on Nuclear Testing
: The CTBT prohibits
all forms of nuclear explosions
—whether for military or civilian purposes—across all environments, including
underground, atmospheric
underwater.
Robust Verification Mechanism
: The treaty includes an
International Monitoring System (IMS)
of over 300 monitoring stations worldwide, capable of detecting nuclear tests, as well as provisions for on-site inspections to ensure compliance with the treaty’s terms.
India is
not a signatory
to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).
Diplomatic Pressure and Dialogue
: Encouraging diplomatic dialogue, especially among the major nuclear powers, could help mitigate tensions and create pathways to gradual disarmament. Leaders must
explore confidence-building measures,
transparency, and mutual reductions in nuclear arsenals.
**********Why the ‘fact-checking’ unit was invalidated?
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Fundamental Rights and its implication;
Why in the News?
On September 20, the Bombay High Court declared the amended IT Rules, 2021, unconstitutional for empowering the Centre’s Fact Check Unit to flag “fake or misleading” content about the government, citing vagueness.
Justice Atul Sharachchandra Chandurkar delivered the decisive ruling as the tie-breaker judge, following a split verdict by a division bench of Justices G.S. Patel and Neela Gokhale in January 2024.
Why did the Bombay High Court strike down IT Rules, 2021?
Violation of Constitutional Rights:
Justice Atul Chandurkar ruled that the amended rules violated
Articles 14 (right to equality)
19 (freedom of speech and expression)
of the Constitution. He characterized the terms
“fake, false, or misleading”
as vague and overbroad, which could lead to arbitrary enforcement by the government.
Censorship Concerns:
The court emphasized that the rules amounted to censorship and lacked necessary procedural safeguards. Justice Patel’s earlier opinion highlighted that they effectively made the government a
“judge in its own cause,”
undermining free speech.
Chilling Effect on Intermediaries:
The requirement for social media intermediaries to act on flagged content
within 36 hours
to retain their legal protections was seen as creating a chilling effect, discouraging platforms from hosting diverse opinions and criticisms of the government.
About Fact Check Unit:
The Fact Check Unit (FCU) under the Press Information Bureau (PIB) of the Government of India was established to combat misinformation and fake news related to government policies and initiatives.
The PIB’s FCU was established in November 2019 and was formally notified as the central government’s fact-checking body under the amended Information Technology (IT) Rules, 2021.
What did the amended rules ask of social media intermediaries?
The amended
Rule 3(1)(b)(v)
mandated that social media intermediaries must:
Make
“reasonable efforts”
to prevent users from uploading content flagged by the FCU as misinformation.
Remove such flagged content
if they wish to maintain their
“safe harbour”
protection against liability for third-party content.
Supreme Court’s Intervention
Appointing Justice Chandurkar as a tie-breaker judge to provide a final ruling on the matter after petitions were filed challenging the amended rules.
Initially dismissing applications for an interim stay on the FCU’s establishment but later staying its operation until a final decision was reached regarding the constitutional validity of the rules.
Way forward:
Strengthen Procedural Safeguards
: Any fact-checking mechanism should include clear, objective guidelines, and an independent review process to avoid arbitrariness and protect free speech rights under the Constitution.
Promote Transparency and Oversight
: Establish a transparent, multi-stakeholder oversight body that includes civil society, legal experts, and technology professionals to ensure fair implementation and avoid misuse of content regulation powers.
