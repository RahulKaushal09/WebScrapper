Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Context:
For the first time in many years, enrolment of students in schools, as per a UDISE+ report, has declined by over a crore in 2022-23 and 2023-24 compared to an average of about 26 crore every year over the previous four years.
Background: –
For the first time, enrolment figures fell to 25.17 crore in 2022-23 and further declined to 24.8 crore in 2023-24. This represents a drop of about 1.55 crore students (nearly 6 per cent) from the 2018-19 to 2021-22 period, when enrolment averaged 26.36 crore.
About UDISE +
The Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) Plus is a data aggregation platform maintained by the education ministry to collate school education data from across the country.
UDISE+ has a mandate of collecting information from all recognized schools imparting formal education from Pre-primary to XII.
The Schools which get onboarded successfully on the platform are provided a UDISE Code, which acts as a national level unique identifier. UDISE+ has the school as the unit of data collection and district as the unit of data distribution.
UDISE+, collects information through an online Data Collection Form (DCF) on parameters ranging from school, Infrastructure, teachers, enrolments, examination results etc. spread across 11 sections.
UDISE serves as a crucial tool for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education.
Drop in numbers
Ministry officials acknowledged the drop in enrolment but said it stemmed from revised data collection methods implemented in 2022-23.
Under the new system, schools must now provide student-specific information rather than just school-level numbers. This requires detailed records for each student, including their name, parent’s name, address, and Aadhaar number, instead of simply reporting total class numbers.

INDIAN COFFEE EXPORTS CROSS $1 BILLION FIRST TIME
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
Traditionally a tea exporter, India is making significant inroads into the global coffee market with total exports during the current financial year up to November crossing the $1-billion mark for the first time, according to data from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).
Notably, India’s exports of tea saw little change despite expectations of gaining new markets following the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, one of the largest tea exporters in the world.
Key takeaways
India is the only country that grows all of its coffee under shade.
India is the seventh-largest producer of coffee globally.
Types of Coffee Grown in India
Arabica (Coffea arabica):
Grown at higher altitudes (900–1,800 meters).
Arabica has a higher market value than Robusta coffee due to its mild aromatic flavour.
Requires a cool climate and less rainfall compared to Robusta.
Robusta (Coffea canephora):
Grown at lower altitudes (500–1,000 meters).
Higher yield and more resistant to diseases.
Preferred for instant coffee production due to its strong flavor.
Major Coffee-Producing States
Karnataka: Largest producer, accounting for about 70% of India’s coffee output.
Key regions: Kodagu (Kodagu district alone produces 33% of India’s coffee) , Chikmagalur, Hassan.
Kerala: Second-largest producer.
Key regions: Wayanad, Idukki, and Palakkad.
Tamil Nadu: Known for its coffee estates in the Nilgiri Hills.
Important regions: Pulneys, Nilgiris, and Shevaroys.
Non-traditional Areas: Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and the northeastern states (especially Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland) are emerging coffee-growing regions.
Climatic Requirements for Coffee
Temperature: 15°C–28°C.
Rainfall: 1,500–2,500 mm annually, well-distributed.
Soil: Well-drained, rich in organic matter.
Reasons for hike in export value
The sharp growth is partly attributed to a surge in Robusta coffee prices and partly due to stocking ahead of the European Union’s new deforestation regulation that could raise the cost of coffee as well as several other agricultural exports to the EU.
The European Union’s Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), aimed at preventing products sold in the EU from being sourced from deforested land, was scheduled for implementation in December. However, the European Parliament recently decided to extend the regulation’s timeline by another year.
According to the think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the EUDR is expected to impact India’s agricultural exports to the EU, valued at $1.3 billion, more severely than exports from competing countries due to India’s higher deforestation rate.

FOUR UN ENVIRONMENTAL SUMMITS FELL SHORT IN 2024
Mains – GS 3
The United Nations’ efforts to address critical environmental challenges hit roadblocks, with four key summits in 2024 — in Colombia on biodiversity, Azerbaijan on climate, Saudi Arabia on land degradation, and South Korea on plastics — failing to deliver meaningful outcomes.
This setback may lead to delayed action on critical issues such as climate finance, drought mitigation, and plastic pollution, with the most vulnerable countries suffering the greatest impact.
Reasons for the setbacks in summits
At the heart of the talks’ breakdown lies a stark and growing divergence in national priorities.
Developing nations, grappling with developmental challenges, economic constraints, and the impacts of climate change, have repeatedly demanded more technology transfer and financial support from developed countries. But developed nations are reluctant to commit resources citing domestic political pressures and economic challenges.
For Example
Colombia Biodiversity Talks: Failure to agree on financing mechanisms for sustainable land-use practices.
Azerbaijan Climate Summit:
Developing nations sought $1.3 trillion annually; developed nations loosely agreed to lesser funds from diverse sources, including private investments.
Disagreement over transitioning from fossil fuels hindered progress.
South Korea Plastic Pollution Talks:
Lack of consensus on a legally binding treaty.
Economies dependent on plastics opposed strict measures, advocating for better usage and recycling practices instead.
Several talks stumbled on disagreements over the frameworks needed to monitor and enforce environmental goals.
In Azerbaijan, discussions on implementing the global stocktake under the Paris Agreement saw divisions over the accountability mechanisms for emission reductions, particularly for high-emission nations.
Global crises including the COVID, economic instability, and geopolitical conflicts have diverted attention and resources away from pressing environmental priorities as governments grapple with urgent domestic concerns such as public health, economic recovery, and social stability.
The setbacks in negotiations complicate the task of addressing environmental challenges:
Delayed action: The failure to agree on frameworks and commit to actions postpone measures required to fight global issues. This delay increases the likelihood of pushing global systems closer to irreversible tipping points.
Incoherent, fragmented efforts: As multilateral processes falter, there is a growing risk of countries turning to unilateral actions. While these initiatives are well-meaning and can make progress, they would lack the global coherence necessary to address issues comprehensively and equitably, and could trigger new problems.
Erosion of trust: Repeated failures in negotiations risk undermining confidence among nations, making future cooperation even more difficult.
Pressure on future summits: The failure of negotiations further forces upcoming meetings to deliver meaningful outcomes.
To advance global environmental goals, several key strategies must be prioritised:
Wealthier nations must honour commitments to provide financial and technological support. This would create an equitable foundation for negotiations and help bridge trust gaps.
Equally critical is the need to enhance transparency and accountability by establishing robust mechanisms to track progress and hold nations accountable for their commitments. This would play a vital role in restoring confidence in processes.
Inclusive diplomacy is also essential to tensions and ensure all voices, particularly those of vulnerable nations, are heard in negotiations. By promoting equitable participation, global cooperation can become more effective and resilient.
Further, there must be a strong focus on implementation — shifting the emphasis from pledges to action. This approach ensures progress even in the face of disagreements.
Finally, it is crucial to acknowledge and address interconnections between biodiversity loss, land degradation, plastic pollution, and climate change. Global talks must prioritise the interconnections and foster integrated strategies.

H-1B VISA
Weeks before he returns as US President, Donald Trump’s supporters are locked in a public row about skilled immigration and H-1B visas.
The infighting was triggered by the appointment of Sriram Krishnan as Trump’s AI adviser, after which an earlier post by Krishnan on X, which had called for “unlock[ing] skilled immigration”, went viral — inviting the ire of Trump’s anti-immigration base. The outrage of the MAGA crowd — the vocal supporters of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan — was directed towards the H-1B visa.
The H-1B visa program allows American employers to hire immigrant workers in occupations that require “a high level of skill” and “at least a bachelor’s degree”, according to the US Department of Labour.
The visa is employer-sponsored, meaning a U.S. employer must file the petition on behalf of the foreign worker
The program was started in 1990, with the intention of helping employers who cannot otherwise obtain needed skills and abilities from the US workforce by authorising the temporary employment of qualified individuals who are not otherwise authorised to work in the U S.
An H-1B visa can be issued for a maximum of six years at a stretch, after which the visa holder has to either leave the US for a period of at least 12 months before returning, or apply for and receive permanent residence (Green Card).
People born in India are the largest beneficiaries of the H-1B program.
Data from the US government show that Indians account for more than 70% of all H-1B petitions approved each year since 2015. People born in China come a distant second, hovering at the 12-13% mark since 2018.

**********Tackling Delimitation by Reversing Population Control
Context
In recent years,
the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have voiced concerns over the implications of the proposed delimitation
exercise and the potential loss of parliamentary seats for southern states.
This development, driven by the south’s advanced fertility transition, highlights a complex intersection of demography
, politics, and regional equity.
The
debate sheds light on the challenges of balancing population trends with political representation
, alongside broader questions about fertility policies and their socio-economic impact.
Fertility Transition and Political Representation
The southern states of India,
including Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu,
have excelled in achieving lower fertility rates,
reflecting successful family planning initiatives.
However,
this demographic success inadvertently poses a political disadvantage.
The delimitation exercise
, which adjusts parliamentary representation based on population,
could reduce the number of seats for states with declining populations
, thereby diminishing their political influence.
This issue underscores a fundamental tension in India’s federal structure
: the ideal of "one person, one vote" clashes with the reality of demographic disparities.
The Debate on Political Representation
As Mr. Naidu and Mr. Stalin have pointed out, this dynamic can create perverse incentives
, encouraging policies that promote higher fertility to preserve political representation.
While Mr. Naidu suggested revisiting policies that incentivise larger families
, Mr. Stalin humorously proposed aiming for significantly more children.
These remarks highlight the absurdity and complexity of addressing regional imbalances
in political representation through demographic measures.
Lessons from Global Experiences
International examples
, such as China’s one-child policy,
offer critical insights into the unintended consequences of fertility regulation.
While China successfully curbed population growth
, the policy led to significant challenges, including a skewed sex ratio,
a rising dependency burden, and an irreversible decline in fertility rates.
Similarly, countries like Japan and South Korea
, despite implementing pro-natalist policies,
have struggled to reverse declining fertility trends.
cases demonstrate that fertility transitions, once achieved, are rarely reversible
through state intervention.
India must tread cautiously to avoid repeating such mistakes.
Quick-fix regulatory measures aimed at increasing fertility could disrupt the natural demographic transition
, creating long-term socio-economic and cultural challenges.
The Debate on Demographic Disparity: Challenges and Implications
The North-South Demographic Divide
, including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka,
have undergone significant demographic transitions over the past decades.
These states have achieved lower fertility rates, higher literacy levels, better healthcare outcomes, and robust economic growth.
largely due to sustained investments in education, family planning, and infrastructure,
alongside proactive governance.
In contrast,
many northern states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, continue to grapple with higher fertility rates
, lower literacy levels, and slower socio-economic progress.
This demographic divide has led to an uneven population growth trajectory
, with northern states accounting for a larger share of India’s overall population.
Increasing Debate on Political Representation
When parliamentary representation is determined solely by population size,
the southern states stand to lose seats due to their slower population growth,
while the northern states gain political clout.
This imbalance creates a paradox where states that have achieved population stabilisation and socio-economic development are penalised
, while those with higher population growth are rewarded.
Implications for Federal Equity
demographic disparity poses significant challenges to the principles of federal equity
Southern states
, which contribute disproportionately to India’s GDP and have lower dependency burdens,
may feel marginalised if their political representation diminishes
This could lead to a sense of alienation and undermine the cooperative spirit
necessary for India’s federal system to function effectively.
At its core, the issue raises a critical question: should population size alone determine political representation,
or should other factors, such as a state’s developmental achievements and contributions to national growth, also be considered?
Gendered Implications
Encouraging higher fertility rates raises critical questions
about the role of women in society and women bear the brunt of reproduction, often at significant personal and professional costs.
Policies aimed at reversing fertility decline must prioritize comprehensive social support systems
, including childcare, healthcare, and compensation for women’s reproductive labour.
Potential Solutions for Equity
Weighted Representation
One potential solution is to introduce weighted representation,
where factors such as literacy rates, healthcare outcomes, and economic contributions are considered alongside population size.
This would ensure that states are rewarded for their developmental achievements
rather than penalised for lower population growth.
Revisiting Delimitation Criteria
The delimitation exercise could be restructured to include demographic and socio-economic indicators
as additional criteria for seat allocation.
For instance,
states that have achieved population stabilization could receive a baseline level of representation,
preventing significant reductions in their parliamentary seats.
Inter-Regional Redistribution
To address the immediate demographic divide,
policies could promote greater inter-regional migration.
Encouraging labour mobility between northern and southern states could help balance population densities
and foster economic integration, thereby reducing the regional divide over time.
Fiscal Incentives for Development
Beyond representation,
fiscal policies could incentivize lagging states to invest in family planning, education, and healthcare.
By addressing the root causes of high population growth,
these policies would help reduce the demographic divide in the long term.
Way Forward: Balancing Unity and Diversity and Evolution of the Role of Federalism
The issue of regional disparities in political representation is not merely a technical challenge
but a test of India’s commitment to federal unity and equity.
Southern states have legitimate concerns about being underrepresented despite their developmental contributions
, while northern states argue that their larger populations warrant greater representation.
Striking a balance between these perspectives requires innovative and inclusive policymaking.
India’s federal system must evolve to accommodate its demographic realities
while preserving the principles of unity and equity.
Recognising regional disparities and addressing them proactively will strengthen trust among states and ensure that all regions feel equally valued
in the national decision-making process.
By doing so
, India can uphold the spirit of cooperative federalism and create a more balanced and inclusive framework for governance
Conclusion
The debate over fertility and representation reflects broader challenges
in managing India’s demographic transition.
Balancing political representation with demographic realities requires innovative solutions
that prioritise equity, sustainability, and gender justice.
Ultimately,
the focus must shift from reversing fertility trends to creating a fair and inclusive framework for governance that respects the diversity and achievements of India’s states.

**********What is Belly Landing?
Recently, as many as 179 people were killed when Jeju Air flight 7C2216 made a belly-landing in South Korea.
About
Belly Landing:
Also known as
gear-up landing
, it is an
emergency landing technique
that involves an aeroplane landing
without extending its landing gear.
It is a
last resort for pilots
who are unable to deploy their landing gear owing to a technical or mechanical malfunction.
Belly-landings are risky and carried out only in an emergency. It results in considerable damage to the plane, its engines and wings as the aircraft skids to a stop and can leave those onboard injured.
The friction generated by the aircraft skidding on the runway can also create sparks or result in a fire.
A cockpit crew decides to land an aircraft on its
belly in the following situations:
Landing gear fails to deploy.
A stricken aircraft cannot make it to an airport and landing is done in a field. The pilot considers skidding the aircraft to a stop safer than touching down on wheels.
Ditching:
when an aircraft makes an emergency landing on water.
Any other situation a pilot considers a belly-landing safer than landing on wheels.
Other aviation terminology:
Landing long and fast:
It is an aviation term that means an aircraft touches down far beyond the designated touchdown zone on the runway, leaving the crew with less runway length to stop the aircraft, and at a speed far exceeding the recommended landing speed.

**********What is Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP)?
The Union Cabinet recently approved the extension of the One-time Special Package for Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) beyond the existing Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) scheme.
About Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP):
It is one of the most
widely used fertilizers globally
,
providing
essential nutrients —
nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P
)—for plant growth.
It is the
second most commonly used fertilizer in India after urea.
high in phosphorus (P)
that stimulates
root establishment and development
-without which plants cannot grow to their normal size or will take too long to mature.
It’s
highly soluble
and thus
dissolves quickly in soil
to release plant-available phosphate and ammonium.
DAP has
additional uses, including:
As a
fire retardant
. For example, a mixture of DAP and other ingredients can be spread in advance of a fire to prevent a forest from burning.
In various industrial processes, such as
metal finishing
An
addition to wine to sustain yeast fermentation
An addition to milk to produce cheese cultures.

**********Government Extends DAP Subsidy to Control Fertilizer Prices
Why in News?
Cabinet approves extension of One-time Special Package on Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) beyond the NBS subsidy for the period from 01.01.2025 till further orders to ensure sustainable availability of DAP at affordable prices to the farmers.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Key Decision of the Union Cabinet
Fertilizer Price Dynamics
Challenges for the Fertilizer Industry
Government’s Strategy
Future Outlook
Key Decision of the Union Cabinet:
Extension of subsidy:
The Centre has extended the Rs 3,500 per tonne special subsidy on di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) for one more year, effective from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025.
Objective:
The decision aims to stabilize farmgate prices and shield farmers from price volatility caused by the rupee's depreciation against the US dollar.
Fertilizer Price Dynamics:
MRP caps on fertilizers:
The government has informally frozen the maximum retail price (MRP) of non-urea fertilizers despite their decontrolled status.
Current MRPs:
DAP:
Rs 1,350 per 50-kg bag
Complex fertilizers:
Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,600 per bag, depending on the composition.
The government’s subsidy on DAP is Rs 21,911 per tonne, along with the Rs 3,500 special concession.
Impact of currency depreciation:
The rupee’s fall against the dollar has raised the cost of imported fertilizers.
Current import costs:
Landed price of DAP:
Rs 54,160 per tonne, up from Rs 52,960 three months ago.
Total cost after additional expenses (e.g., customs, handling, and dealer margins): Rs 65,000 per tonne.
Challenges for the Fertilizer Industry:
Viability concerns:
Fertilizer companies face unviable import economics unless:
The government increases subsidies.
Companies are allowed to revise MRPs upward.
Even with the extended subsidy, companies estimate a shortfall of Rs 1,500 per tonne due to currency depreciation.
Stock levels:
Current stocks of DAP (9.2 lakh tonnes) and complex fertilizers (23.7 lakh tonnes) are below last year’s levels.
Insufficient imports may lead to supply challenges for the next kharif season (June-July 2025).
Government’s Strategy:
Compensation for imports:
On September 20, 2024, the government approved compensation for DAP imports above a benchmark landed price of $559.71 per tonne.
However, these calculations were based on an exchange rate of Rs 83.23 per dollar, which has since fallen below Rs 85.7.
Fiscal implications:
The extended subsidy will cost the government an additional Rs 6,475 crore.
Any MRP hike is expected to have minimal political implications, given that major agriculture states are not going to polls soon and the current DAP consumption season is over.
Future Outlook:
Immediate priority:
Ensuring adequate fertilizer availability for the kharif season by securing imports of both finished fertilizers and raw materials.
The government’s ability to balance fiscal constraints, industry viability, and farmer affordability will be critical in the coming months.

**********Russian gas exports to Europe via Ukraine halted as transit deal expires
Why in news?
On New Year’s Day, Russian natural gas exports to Europe via Soviet-era pipelines through Ukraine were stopped as the transit deal expired, with no agreement reached between Moscow and Kyiv. This marks the end of Russia’s oldest gas route to Europe.
The Ukrainian government justified its decision as necessary for national security amid the military conflict.
What’s in today’s article?
Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod Pipeline Overview
Volume of gas supplied through Ukraine
Possible impact
Options available to the buyers
The pipeline transports gas from Siberia through Sudzha, located in Russia's Kursk region, now under Ukrainian military control.
It flows through Ukraine to Slovakia, branching into the Czech Republic and Austria.
Transdniestria, bordering Ukraine, receives Russian gas via Ukraine.
Decline in Russia's Gas Exports to Europe
Russia's gas supply to Europe has drastically reduced since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Moscow's share of the European gas market, once 35%, has dropped to 8%.
Diminished Gas Transit via Ukraine
By December 2024,
the EU received less than 14 bcm of gas via Ukraine
, a sharp decline from 65 bcm/year in 2020.
Ukraine earns $800 million to $1 billion annually in transit fees, while Russia could earn approximately $5 billion from sales via Ukraine in 2024.
Europe's Energy Diversification
The European Union has offset the loss of Russian gas with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and non-Russian pipeline imports.
Competitors like Norway, the United States, and Qatar have gained market share at Russia's expense.
Possible Impact
Impact on Russia and Gazprom
Economic Losses
: Ukraine faces a loss of $800 million annually in transit fees, while Gazprom loses nearly $5 billion in gas sales.
Decline in Gas Exports
: Russian gas transit through Ukraine fell from 65 bcm in 2020 to about 15 bcm in 2023.
Collapse of European Market Share
: At its peak, Russia controlled 35% of Europe’s gas market, but the war has significantly eroded this dominance.
Impact on EU
Countries affected
The Ukraine route serves Austria and Slovakia. Austria received most of its gas via Ukraine, while Slovakia takes around 3 bcm from Gazprom per year, about two-thirds of its needs.
Slovakia has said the loss of Russian supply would not hit its consumption and that it has diversified supply contracts.
Ukraine’s gas supply remains unaffected as it no longer relies on Russian transit gas.
Market Impact
EU gas prices reached record highs in 2022 but are unlikely to repeat due to the small remaining volumes of Russian gas and reduced dependency.
Shutting Down Other Pipelines
Yamal-Europe Pipeline
: Closed via Belarus.
Nord Stream Pipeline
: Severely damaged in 2022.
Alternative Routes and Adjustments
TurkStream Pipeline
: Russia continues to export gas via TurkStream, supplying Turkey, Hungary, and Serbia.
European Union’s Shift
: EU countries have diversified their energy sources to reduce dependency on Russian gas since 2022.
Slovakia:
Diversifies gas supply from Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland.
Austria:
Secured alternative supplies and prepared for the transition.
Czech Republic:
Tapping into German pipelines, exempt from German gas levies, and supporting Slovakia with transit and storage capacities.
Moldova’s Challenges
: Moldova, severely affected, plans to cut gas usage by a third.
Russia supplies Moldova with about 2 bcm of gas per year. It is piped via Ukraine to the breakaway region of Transdniestria where it is used to generate cheap power that is sold to government-controlled parts of Moldova.
Moldova has diversified its sources and will reduce gas consumption by a third starting January 1.

**********Crop insurance scheme gets Rs 69,515 crore boost
Why in news?
The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the continuation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and the Restructured Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme until 2025-26.
The schemes have been allocated an enhanced outlay of ₹69,515.71 crore for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26.
What’s in today’s article?
Key features of the PMFBY
About:
A scheme of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, PMFBY is an insurance service for farmers for their yields, launched in 2016.
The new Crop Insurance Scheme is in line with the One Nation One Scheme theme.
The PMFBY replaced the previous two schemes: the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) and the Modified NAIS.
It has incorporated the best features of all previous schemes while eliminating all previous shortcomings.
Objectives:
To provide insurance coverage and financial support to the farmers in the event of failure of any of the notified crops as a result of natural calamities, pests and diseases.
To stabilise the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming.
To encourage farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices.
To ensure flow of credit to the agriculture sector.
Premium rates
There will be a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all Kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops (winter sown).
In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%.
Area based approach
The Scheme will be implemented on an
'Area Approach basis
,' i.e., Defined Areas for each notified crop for widespread calamities,
The unit of insurance shall be Village/Village Panchayat level for major crops and for other crops it may be a unit of size above the level of Village/Village Panchayat.
It is assumed that all insured farmers in a unit of insurance, to be defined as a "Notified Area" for a crop, face similar risk exposures.
No upper limit to subsidy
There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. This means, even if the balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the Government.
Use of technology
Smartphones will be used to capture and upload data of crop cutting to reduce the delays in claim payment to farmers.
Remote sensing will be used to reduce the number of crops cutting experiments.
The use of technology will be encouraged to a great extent. For example,
Beneficiaries to be covered
Earlier, the enrolment was compulsory for farmers who possess a Crop Loan account or Kisan Credit Card (KCC) account, etc).
All farmers growing notified crops in a notified area during the season who have insurable interest in the crop are eligible.
To address the demand of farmers, the scheme has been made voluntary for all farmers from Kharif 2020.
Restructured Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS)
RWBCIS was introduced by the Government of India in 2016 to safeguard farmers against
financial losses caused by unfavourable weather conditions
These conditions encompass factors such as rainfall, temperature, wind, and humidity.
The scheme offers coverage for a range of crops, including food crops, oilseeds, and commercial or horticultural crops.
Its primary objective is to provide comprehensive insurance protection for various perils like drought, flood, cyclone, and hailstorm, thereby mitigating the impact of crop damage on farmers.
Eligibility
- All farmers, including sharecroppers and tenant farmers, growing notified crops in notified areas.
Continuation of PMFBY and RWBCIS till 2025-26
The Union Cabinet approved the continuation of the PMFBY and the RWBCIS until 2025-26.
Risk Coverage and Technology Infusio
The schemes aim to provide risk coverage for crops against non-preventable natural calamities.
To increase transparency and efficiency in claim calculation and settlement, the Cabinet approved the creation of the
Fund for Innovation and Technology (FIAT)
with a corpus of ₹824.77 crore.
Technological Initiatives under FIAT
Yield Estimation System using Technology (YES-TECH)
Utilizes Remote Sensing Technology for yield estimation, with at least 30% weightage to technology-based estimates.
Currently implemented in 9 states, with efforts to onboard others.
Madhya Pradesh has adopted 100% technology-based yield estimation, eliminating the need for Crop Cutting Experiments.
Weather Information and Network Data Systems (WINDS)
Plans to establish
Automatic Weather Stations (AWS)
at the block level and
Automatic Rain Gauges (ARGs)
at the Panchayat level.
Aims to increase network density fivefold for hyper-local weather data.
WINDS implementation starts in 2024-25, with states like Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh participating.
Special Provisions for Northeastern States
The Centre will share 90% of the premium subsidy for Northeastern states.
Flexibility is provided to reallocate funds to other development projects if required due to low gross cropped area or voluntary participation.
Key Benefits
Enhanced risk coverage for farmers across India.
Transition to technology-based systems for increased accuracy and transparency.
Support for Northeastern farmers with higher subsidy sharing.

**********Amendments to Prison Rules to Eliminate Caste-Based Discrimination and Address Habitual Offenders
Why in News?
The Union Home Ministry has introduced significant amendments to the
Model Prison Manual, 2016
, and the
Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023
.
The Amendments are aimed at addressing caste-based discrimination and refining the definition and treatment of habitual offenders in Indian prisons.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Amendments to Prison Rules (Caste-based Discrimination, Habitual Offenders, Significance, etc.)
Background:
The Supreme Court, in its October 3, 2024 ruling, highlighted the persistence of caste-based discrimination and inconsistencies in defining habitual offenders across states.
It directed governments to update their legal frameworks and ensure equality and fairness in prison administration.
This judgment forms the basis for the Home Ministry’s comprehensive overhaul of prison rules.
Addressing Caste-Based Discrimination in Prisons:
To eradicate caste-based discrimination within prisons, the following changes have been implemented:
Prohibition of Discrimination
Prison authorities are now mandated to ensure there is no
discrimination, classification, or segregation
of prisoners based on their caste.
Duties and work assignments within prisons must be allocated without prejudice, promoting equal treatment for all inmates.
Legal Provisions in Prison Rules
A new section,
55(A)
, titled ‘Prohibition of caste-based discrimination in Prisons and Correctional Institutions,’ has been added under the Miscellaneous category of the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023.
This ensures a codified framework to eliminate caste-based practices.
Implementation of Manual Scavenging Prohibition
The provisions of the
Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
, have been extended to prisons and correctional institutions.
Manual scavenging and hazardous cleaning of sewers or septic tanks
within prisons are explicitly prohibited, safeguarding inmates from degrading practices.
Redefining Habitual Offenders:
The amendments also address the treatment and classification of habitual offenders, following Supreme Court directives to standardize definitions and ensure adherence to constitutional principles:
Unified Definition
is now defined as an individual who, during any continuous period of five years, has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment on more than two occasions for offences committed on different occasions (not part of the same transaction), provided these sentences are not overturned on appeal or review.
Time spent in jail under sentence or detention will not be included in the five-year period.
Legislative Consistency
In states lacking specific
Habitual Offenders Acts
, the Union and state governments are required to align their prison manuals and rules with the Supreme Court’s judgment within three months.
The amendments aim to create consistency across jurisdictions by replacing varied state definitions of habitual offenders with a standard model.
Significance of the Amendments:
Ensuring Equality
The amendments aim to uphold the constitutional right to equality and dignity for all prisoners, irrespective of their caste or background.
Eliminating Degrading Practices
By prohibiting manual scavenging and hazardous cleaning, the rules reinforce humane treatment within prisons.
Standardized Framework
The unified definition of habitual offenders ensures consistent treatment of repeat offenders across states, avoiding arbitrary classifications.
Conclusion:
These amendments mark a significant step toward ensuring a fair and non-discriminatory prison environment.
By addressing caste-based discrimination and aligning the treatment of habitual offenders with constitutional principles, the Union Home Ministry aims to create a more just and equitable correctional system.
These changes reflect India's commitment to human rights and the rule of law, setting a progressive precedent for prison reforms nationwide.

**********The nature of dissent in the Indian judiciary
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Accountability of Judiciary;
Why in the News?
In the U.S. Supreme Court, dissenting opinions often reflect the political views of judges, as they are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. In contrast, dissenting opinions in the Indian judiciary cover a wider range, including political, social, and purely intellectual disagreements
What is the significance of dissenting opinions?
Preservation of Judicial Independence:
Dissenting opinions serve as a safeguard for judicial independence, allowing judges to express their disagreements with majority decisions without fear of repercussions. This fosters a culture of open debate within the judiciary, which is essential for a healthy democracy.
Shaping Legal Precedents:
Dissent can influence future legal interpretations and decisions. Over time, dissenting views may gain traction and become part of the evolving legal landscape, as seen in cases like
ADM Jabalpur
P.V. Narasimha Rao
, where dissents later informed subsequent rulings.
Encouraging Public Discourse:
Dissenting opinions can stimulate public discussion and debate about important legal and constitutional issues. They often highlight alternative perspectives that may resonate with societal values or concerns, thereby enriching democratic dialogue.
How does dissent in the Indian judiciary compare to that in the U.S.?
Political Influences:
In the U.S., dissent often reflects the political affiliations of justices, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. For example, Justice Samuel Alito’s dissents align with conservative viewpoints on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage.
In contrast, Indian judges are selected through a collegium system, which aims to reduce political influence on judicial decisions, resulting in dissents that may not necessarily align with current political sentiments.
Nature of Dissents:
U.S. Supreme Court dissents frequently stem from ideological divides among justices, whereas Indian judicial dissents encompass a broader spectrum, including political, social, and intellectual disagreements.
For instance, Justices Khehar and Nazeer in
Shayara Bano
focused on the social implications of personal law rather than political affiliations.
Impact on Law:
While both systems recognise the importance of dissent in shaping jurisprudence, Indian dissents have historically led to significant legal changes post-ruling, as seen in cases like
Sita Soren
where earlier dissents influenced the court’s later position on parliamentary immunity.
What challenges and criticisms surround judicial dissent in India?
Risk of Retaliation:
Judges who dissent against majority opinions may face professional backlash or career repercussions. Notable cases include Justice H.R. Khanna, who was superseded as Chief Justice after his dissent in
, highlighting potential risks for dissenters within the judiciary.
Infrequent Dissent:
Despite its importance, dissent is relatively rare in the Indian Supreme Court compared to its potential significance. The Chief Justice often avoids dissenting opinions in constitutional bench cases, which raises concerns about conformity over independent judicial reasoning.
Public Perception:
Judicial dissent can sometimes be viewed negatively by the public or political entities as undermining judicial authority or coherence. This perception can discourage judges from expressing their dissent openly.
Way forward:
Institutional Support for Dissent:
Establish mechanisms to safeguard dissenting judges from career repercussions, such as transparent evaluation criteria and protections for judicial independence, ensuring open debate within the judiciary.
Promote Judicial Dialogue:
Encourage a culture of constructive dissent by incorporating dissenting opinions into judicial training and fostering recognition of their long-term contributions to legal evolution.
Mains PYQ:
Critically examine the Supreme Court’s judgement on ‘National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014’ with reference to appointment of judges of higher judiciary in India.
(UPSC IAS/2017)
**********Tackling delimitation by reversing population control
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related to Delimitation;
Why in the News?
Recently, the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, N. Chandrababu Naidu and M.K. Stalin, expressed their frustration over the proposed
delimitation exercise
, which might lead to their states losing parliamentary seats.
How Does Population Control Influence Delimitation?
Population as the Basis for Representation:
Delimitation exercises are based on the population count, which determines the number of seats allocated to states in Parliament.
Southern States’ Success in Population Control:
Southern states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, which have achieved lower fertility rates, face the risk of reduced parliamentary representation.
Demographic Divide:
States with higher population growth (mainly in northern India) may gain more seats, leading to an imbalance in political representation.
What are the implications of current demographic trends on political representation?
Seat Redistribution:
The impending delimitation exercise, scheduled for 2026, may lead to a significant redistribution of Lok Sabha seats.
Estimates suggest that states like Uttar Pradesh could gain up to 14 additional seats, while Tamil Nadu might lose several, decreasing its representation from 39 to potentially 30 seats.
Federal Structure Concerns:
The southern states argue that using population counts for political representation undermines the federal structure of India. They contend that it is unjust to penalize regions that have successfully managed population growth while rewarding those with higher growth rates.
What are the arguments for and against reversing population control measures during delimitation?
Reversing population
refers to attempts to increase fertility rates through incentives, aiming to counteract declining population growth trends.
Argument in favour of Reversal:
Political Strategy:
South political leaders advocate for incentivizing larger families as a means to maintain or increase political representation in light of the delimitation concerns.
Cultural Context:
There is a push to celebrate larger families as a cultural norm, with comments from leaders suggesting an exaggerated approach to family size as a humorous response to the delimitation threat.
Argument against Reversal:
Long-term Consequences:
Experts argue that reversing fertility rates through incentives may not be effective or sustainable. Historical examples, such as China’s one-child policy, illustrate the challenges and unintended consequences of aggressive population control measures.
Social Support Necessity:
Encouraging higher birth rates without adequate social support for families could place additional burdens on women and society at large. Effective policies should focus on providing necessary support rather than merely increasing birth rates.
What reforms are necessary for a fair delimitation process? (Way forward)
Equitable Representation Criteria:
Reforms should consider not only population counts but also socio-economic characteristics, ensuring that regions with successful population management are not unfairly penalized in political representation.
Stakeholder Consultations:
Increased dialogue among stakeholders is essential to address concerns regarding the delimitation process. This could involve re-evaluating how political representation is determined based on demographic trends and regional development successes.
Migration Policies:
To address regional population imbalances, promoting migration could serve as a viable solution alongside revising how political representation is allocated based on demographic characteristics rather than sheer numbers alone.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the main objectives of Population Education and point out the measures to achieve them in India in detail.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Willow Quantum Processor
Why in the News?
Google has unveiled its latest
quantum processor
, ‘
, which has sparked excitement about the potential of quantum computers to solve practical problems.
About Willow
Quantum Processor:
Google’s team of researchers developed Willow and shared their results in the scientific journal
Nature
Willow has
105 qubits
, which are the basic units of information in quantum computers.
Some qubits perform the actual calculations (called
data qubits
).
Others check for mistakes and fix them (called
measurement qubits
It operates at an extremely low temperature—
almost absolute zero (-273.15°C)
—to keep its qubits stable.
How fast is It?
Willow solved a tough problem in just a few minutes. The same task would take the world’s best regular computer
10 septillion years
(that’s 1 followed by 24 zeros!).
Each qubit can stay stable for
100 microseconds
(a tiny fraction of a second), which is a big improvement for quantum computers.
Features and Significance
Smarter Error Handling:
Quantum computers are extremely sensitive, and even the tiniest disturbance can cause errors.
Willow uses a system where some qubits (called
) are dedicated to
spotting and fixing errors
without disturbing the main qubits (called
) that are doing the calculations.
Bigger, Better Performance:
: about half for computations and the rest for error correction.
Most quantum computers become less reliable as more qubits are added. Willow is different—it actually
