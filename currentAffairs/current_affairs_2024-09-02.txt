Syllabus
Prelims: CURRENT EVENT
Context
: Prime Minister flags off 3 Vande Bharat trains.
Background: –
The trains flagged off by PM through video conferencing connect Meerut with Lucknow, Madurai with Bengaluru, and Chennai with Nagercoil, taking the number of Vande Bharat trains above 100.
Key takeaways
The Vande Bharat Express, also known as Train 18, is a significant project by Indian Railways aimed at modernizing and speeding up rail travel in India.
Launch: The first Vande Bharat Express was launched in 2019.
Purpose: It is designed to provide a high-speed, comfortable, and efficient travel experience.
Features
Speed: The train can reach speeds up to 180 km/h, although it typically operates at around 130 km/h due to track conditions.
Design: It features a sleek, aerodynamic design with fully air-conditioned chair car coaches. Vande Bharat sleeper coaches will be available soon.
The Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai, designs and manufactures the Vande Bharat Express trainsets. The ICF is the largest rail coach manufacturer in the world and is owned and operated by the Indian Railways.
Comfort: The train offers modern amenities such as onboard Wi-Fi, GPS-based passenger information systems, and bio-vacuum toilets.
Self-Propelled: Unlike traditional trains, the Vande Bharat Express is self-propelled, meaning it doesn’t require a separate locomotive. This is called a distributed traction power system. Distributed power gives the train higher acceleration and deceleration compared to loco-hauled trains, which take a much longer time to reach top speed or to gradually come to a halt.
Energy Efficiency: It is equipped with regenerative braking systems that save energy by converting kinetic energy into electrical energy during braking.

CENSOR BOARD YET TO CLEAR KANGANA’S FILM
Prelims : Polity
Context:
The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has not yet given certification to the film Emergency, starring actor and Lok Sabha member Kangana Ranaut. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) stated that the Board will consider the feelings of all communities, including the Sikh community, when making its decision.
ASG represented the Union Government and the CBFC before the Punjab and Haryana High Court, during a hearing on a petition filed by Mohali residents challenging the certification of the film. The ASG informed the court that the certification process is still ongoing and that anyone with concerns can submit their views to the Board.
About Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC)
The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), commonly known as the Censor Board, is a statutory body under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in India. It was established under the Cinematograph Act of 19521.
Key Functions and Responsibilities:
Film Certification: The CBFC certifies films, trailers, documentaries, and advertisements for public exhibition. Films can only be publicly exhibited in India after receiving certification from the CBFC.
Categories of Certification:
U (Universal): Suitable for all age groups.
UA (Parental Guidance): Suitable for children above 12, but parental guidance is advised for those under 12.
A (Adult): Restricted to adult audiences (18 years and above).
S (Special): Restricted to specialized audiences, such as doctors or scientists.
Legal Framework:
The CBFC operates under the Cinematograph Act, 1952, which outlines the guidelines for film certification.
The Act allows for reasonable restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression in films, in the interests of sovereignty, integrity, security of the state, public order, decency, or morality.
Certification process
When a filmmaker applies for certification, the Regional Officer appoints an Examining Committee. For short films, the committee includes an advisory panel member and an examining officer, with at least one being a woman. For other films, the committee has four members from the advisory panel and an examiningofficer, with at least two women.
The Regional Officer decides the film’s certification—U, U/A, A, or S—based on the Examining Committee’s unanimous or majority report. If the committee is divided, the chairperson makes the final decision.
If a filmmaker is dissatisfied with the certification, they can request a second viewing by a Revising Committee. This committee must exclude members from the initial review and must include at least one Board member, whose involvement is mandatory only at this stage. A Board member can participate in the initial review, but their presence is required only during the revising stage.
Recent Initiatives:
Accessibility Standards: The CBFC has introduced guidelines to make films accessible to persons with hearing and visual impairments.
Digital Transformation: The CBFC has launched a revamped website and a mobile app (e-cine app) to streamline the certification process.

2G BIO-ETHANOL
Prelims & Mains: CURRENT EVENT
The Indian government is planning to set up dedicated enzyme manufacturing facilities to boost ethanol production.
The first plant is expected to be established in Manesar, Haryana. This facility will likely supply enzymes to proposed 2G bio-ethanol plants in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and an existing plant in Haryana. This initiative is part of the BioE3 policy, which aims to enhance biotechnology-driven manufacturing in India.
About 2G (second-generation) bio-ethanol
2G (second-generation) bio-ethanol is produced from non-food biomass, such as agricultural residues, wood chips, and other lignocellulosic materials.
Unlike first-generation bio-ethanol, which is made from food crops like corn and sugarcane, 2G bio-ethanol uses feedstocks that are not part of the human food chain. This makes it a more sustainable and environmentally friendly option.
The process involves breaking down the complex carbohydrates in the biomass into simple sugars, which are then fermented to produce ethanol. This typically requires specialized enzymes to convert the lignocellulosic materials into fermentable sugars.
Key benefits of 2G bio-ethanol:
Reduces waste: Utilizes agricultural residues that would otherwise be discarded or burned.
Lower greenhouse gas emissions: Produces fewer emissions compared to fossil fuels and first-generation bio-ethanol.
Energy security: Reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels by providing a renewable energy source.
Ethanol
Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is a clear, colourless liquid that is flammable and has a characteristic odour.
It is produced through the fermentation of sugars by yeast or through chemical processes like the hydration of ethylene.
Ethanol can be derived from both biological and chemical sources, while bioethanol is exclusively produced from biological sources.
Uses of Ethanol
Beverages: Ethanol is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, and spirits.
Fuel: It is used as a biofuel and is often blended with gasoline to produce ethanol-blended fuels. This helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.
Industrial Solvent: Due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of substances, ethanol is used as a solvent in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, perfumes, and other products.
Medical and Laboratory Uses: Ethanol is used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and preservative in medical and laboratory settings.
Chemical Feedstock: It serves as a feedstock for the production of various chemicals.

ANTI-DUMPING DUTY
Prelims : ECONOMY
Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has recommended imposing an anti-dumping duty on aluminium foils imported from China.
This recommendation follows a complaint by domestic producers, who argued that the influx of cheap Chinese aluminium foils was harming the local industry. The proposed duty ranges between $619 and $873 per tonne.
About Anti-dumping duty
Anti-dumping duty is a protectionist tariff that a domestic government imposes on foreign imports believed to be priced below fair market value.
This practice, known as “dumping,” can harm domestic industries by undercutting local businesses and distorting market competition.
The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, is responsible for investigating and recommending the imposition of anti-dumping duties in India.
Decision-Making Process:
Investigation: The DGTR conducts an investigation to determine if dumping has occurred and its impact on the domestic industry.
Recommendation: Based on the findings, the DGTR makes a recommendation to the Ministry of Finance.
Imposition: The Ministry of Finance makes the final decision to impose the anti-dumping duty.
Purpose of imposing anti-dumping duties in India are to:
Protecting Domestic Industries: Anti-dumping duties shield domestic industries from unfair competition by preventing foreign companies from flooding the market with underpriced goods.
Preserving Job: By safeguarding domestic industries from the adverse effects of dumping, anti-dumping duties help prevent job losses that may occur if local companies are unable to compete with cheaper imports.
Maintaining Fair Competition: Anti-dumping duties promote fair competition by ensuring that imported goods are priced at levels comparable to their fair market value. This prevents foreign companies from gaining an unfair advantage.
Supporting Fair Trade Practices: Imposing anti-dumping duties discourages unethical trade practices such as predatory pricing and dumping. By penalizing such practices, anti-dumping measures encourage adherence to fair trade principles and discourage market manipulation.
Protecting Intellectual Property: Anti-dumping duties can also help protect intellectual property rights by discouraging the importation of counterfeit or infringing goods. By deterring the influx of low-priced counterfeit products, these duties help safeguard the interests of innovators and creators.
Stimulating Domestic Production: Anti-dumping duties incentivize domestic production by reducing the competitive disadvantage faced by local manufacturers.
Promoting Economic Stability: By safeguarding domestic industries and preserving jobs, anti-dumping duties contribute to economic stability and resilience. By preventing disruptions caused by unfair trade practices, these measures support sustainable growth and development in the long term.

LA NINA
Prelims & Mains : GEOGRAPHY
India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted a rainy September for several parts of north India due to the expected La Nina conditions.
La Niña has several notable effects on India, primarily due to its influence on the monsoon season and overall weather patterns.
<img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-197037 size-full" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="334" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/el-i.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/el-i.png 501w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/el-i-300x200.png 300w" width="501"/>
About La Niña
La Niña is a climate pattern characterized by the cooling of sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.
This phenomenon is part of the larger El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, which also includes El Niño (the warming phase) and a neutral phase.
Key features of La Niña:
Cooler Ocean Temperatures: The central and eastern Pacific Ocean experiences cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures.
Weather Impacts: La Niña typically brings wetter-than-normal conditions to Southeast Asia, Australia, and parts of India, while causing drier conditions in the southwestern United States and parts of South America.
Monsoon Influence: In India, La Niña is often associated with stronger monsoon seasons, leading to above-average rainfall.
Global Effects: It can influence global weather patterns, including increased hurricane activity in the Atlantic and cooler, wetter winters in the northern United States.
Effects of La Niña on India
Enhanced Monsoon Rains: La Niña typically brings above-average rainfall during the monsoon season (June to September). This can be beneficial for agriculture, as it improves water availability.
Flooding Risks: While increased rainfall can be beneficial, it also raises the risk of flooding, particularly in low-lying areas and regions with poor drainage systems.
Agricultural Productivity: The increased rainfall can lead to better crop yields for rain-fed crops like rice, sugarcane, and pulses. However, excessive rain can also damage crops and lead to waterlogging.
Water Resources: La Niña can improve the water levels in reservoirs, rivers, and groundwater, which is crucial for irrigation and drinking water supplies.
Temperature Variations: La Niña can lead to cooler-than-normal temperatures in some parts of India, especially during the winter months.
Pest and Disease Outbreaks: The wetter conditions can create a favourable environment for pests and diseases, which can harm crops and reduce yields.

**********Rights of the accused in PMLA cases and recent SC Verdicts
Why in news?
The Supreme Court in
Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India (2022)
upheld several provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), affirming the broad powers of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in investigating and arresting individuals accused of money laundering. In this judgement, the apex court supported stringent bail conditions under the PMLA, reinforcing the Act's robust framework to tackle money laundering.
However, despite this ruling, the Supreme Court has also made
smaller interventions that have gradually moderated some of these stringent provisions
. These interventions aim to balance the need for stringent anti-money laundering measures with the protection of individual rights, particularly concerning arrest and bail.
This reflects the Court's ongoing efforts to ensure that the enforcement of the PMLA does not infringe on the fundamental rights of the accused.
What’s in today’s article?
Various relaxations extended by the Supreme Court to the PMLA Accused
On grounds of arrest
Section 19 of the PMLA gives the ED the power of arrest if the material it possesses gives it reason to believe an individual is guilty of money laundering.
The accused must be informed of the grounds of arrest “as soon as may be”.
Supreme Court ruled that the ED is not required to provide a copy of the Enforcement Case Information Report (similar to an FIR) to the accused, but only needs to inform them of the reasons for their arrest
However, in
Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India (2023)
, the Supreme Court emphasized that the
accused have a fundamental right under Article 20 of the Constitution to be informed of the grounds of their arrest
The Court observed that, in practice, the grounds were sometimes provided orally and sometimes in writing.
It clarified that the grounds of arrest must always be given in writing, without exception. Failure to provide written grounds would render the arrest illegal and invalid.
This verdict underscores the
importance of protecting the rights of the accused while ensuring the enforcement of the law
On bail for undertrials
436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)
allowed for the release on bail of individuals detained for up to half the maximum period of imprisonment for an offense while their trial or investigation was ongoing.
In Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India (2022), the Supreme Court extended this provision to apply to cases under the PMLA.
This interpretation was reaffirmed by the Court in May 2024 in Ajay Ajit Peter Kerkar v. Directorate of Enforcement.
However, Section 436A has been replaced by
Section 479 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita
, which may impact PMLA cases.
A key change is a new explanation that excludes the application of the bail provision if multiple offenses or cases are pending against the accused—a scenario common in money laundering cases.
amendment potentially limits the benefit of bail under the PMLA, making it more challenging for accused individuals to secure release under the revised legal framework
However, in August 2024, while delivering a verdict, SC reiterated that the legal principle “
bail is the rule and jail is the exception
” will apply even in cases registered under the PMLA.
On ‘need and necessity to arrest’
In July 2024, the SC granted interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi excise policy case, where the ED had arrested him under Section 19 of the PMLA.
Kejriwal challenged the legality of his arrest, arguing that there was no "necessity" for it.
He claimed that the material on which the ED based his arrest was available in July 2023, but he was only arrested in March 2024.
Section 19(1) of the PMLA requires the ED to have reason to believe that the accused is guilty, which the
court noted must meet a high threshold
, implying that
these reasons should be based on "evidence admissible in court
The Supreme Court also referred the question of whether the "need and necessity to arrest" can be a valid ground for challenging an arrest under the PMLA to a five-judge bench for further consideration.
This referral indicates the court's intention to scrutinize the conditions under which arrests are made under the PMLA, potentially influencing future interpretations of the law.
On relaxing twin conditions
In August 2024, the SC granted bail to former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in the Delhi excise policy case.
Under Section 45 of the PMLA, the
"twin conditions" for bail
are stringent:
the accused must prove that they did not commit an offense under the PMLA and are unlikely to commit any offense while on bail
This effectively reverses the standard burden of proof in criminal cases.
However, the bench ruled that these conditions could be relaxed in cases where the accused has been incarcerated for a long period without trial proceedings commencing.
In Sisodia's case, he had been imprisoned for approximately 17 months without the trial starting.
This decision underscores
the Court's recognition of prolonged pre-trial detention as a factor warranting the relaxation of otherwise stringent bail conditions under the PMLA
On bail exception for women
In August 2024, the apex Court granted bail to BRS leader K Kavitha in the Delhi excise policy case, citing the exception in Section 45 of the PMLA, which allows for the release on bail of women if the Special Court so directs.
The Supreme Court overturned the Delhi High Court's earlier decision to deny Kavitha bail
, where the High Court had argued that because she was "well educated," she did not qualify as a "vulnerable woman" under the exception
The ruling reaffirms that the exception in Section 45 is applicable to women regardless of their educational background, ensuring that the provision is interpreted in a manner consistent with its intent.
On confession to ED officer
Section 50 of the PMLA
empowers the ED to summon individuals and require them to make statements during investigations.
In Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India (2022), the SC ruled that
this provision does not violate the right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution
However, under Section 25 of the Evidence Act, 1872 (now
Section 23 of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023
confessions made to police officers are inadmissible as evidence during a trial
In Prem Prakash v. Union of India (2024), a case was presented where the accused admitted guilt while in judicial custody.
In this case, the SC said that
a person in custody cannot be considered as operating with a free mind, suggesting that such an individual might be under duress or coercion
In past judgments, the apex court held that evidence obtained through compelled testimony or coercive methods violates the right against self-incrimination.
This reasoning emphasizes that confessions or admissions made while in custody, especially if they are compelled or coerced, cannot be considered voluntary.
Hence, they are inadmissible as evidence, reinforcing the protection against self-incrimination.

**********Rule 170 of Drugs Act
Why in news?
In the ongoing Supreme Court case against Patanjali Ayurved, Justices Hima Kohli and Sandeep Mehta criticized and stayed the AYUSH ministry for its July 1 notification. The notification directed state licensing authorities not to take any action under Rule 170 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.
Rule 170, introduced in 2018, aims to prevent misleading advertisements of AYUSH products.
What’s in today’s article?
Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940
Challenges in regulating AYUSH drugs
Background of the case
About
It oversees the import, production, and distribution of drugs in India.
Its main objective is to ensure that the drugs and cosmetics marketed in India are reliable, efficient, and in compliance with the national standards.
The associated Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 were formulated in association with the 1940 Act.
The rules provide provisions for classifying medications into schedules and instructions for the storage, sale, presentation, and prescription of each schedule.
Key provisions
Licensing
: The Act mandates that all drug and cosmetic manufacturers and sellers must obtain licenses from the drug control authorities.
Standards and Testing
: It sets standards for the quality of drugs and cosmetics and requires rigorous testing to ensure compliance.
Approval Process
: The Act outlines the approval process for new drugs, including clinical trials and safety evaluations.
Regulation of Advertisements
: It regulates the advertisement of drugs and cosmetics to prevent misleading claims and ensure truthful information is provided to consumers.
Penalties:
The Act prescribes penalties for violations, including manufacturing or selling substandard or misbranded drugs and cosmetics.
Background – why rule 170 was introduced
Rule 170 was introduced in response to a parliamentary standing committee's concerns about misleading claims in AYUSH product advertisements and the need for stricter oversight by the AYUSH ministry.
Key features
In 2018, the Indian government introduced Rule 170 under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act to regulate the manufacture, storage, and sale of Ayurvedic, Siddha, and Unani medicines, with a focus on controlling misleading advertisements.
This rule
prohibits AYUSH drug manufacturers from advertising their products without prior approval
issuance of a unique identification number
by the state licensing authority.
Manufacturers must submit detailed information, including textual references, rationale, safety, effectiveness, and quality of the drugs.
The rule mandates rejection of applications if:
contact details are missing,
the advertisement is obscene or vulgar,
it promotes sexual enhancement,
it features celebrities or government officials,
it references government organizations, or makes false or exaggerated claims.
Challenges to regulate AYUSH drugs
Under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, manufacturers of AYUSH drugs, like those of allopathic medicines, must obtain a license from the drug controller.
However, unlike allopathic drugs, which require extensive phase I, II, and III trials or equivalence studies before approval,
most AYUSH drugs can be approved based on the rationale provided in authoritative texts of their respective streams
Safety trials are only required for formulations containing around 60 specific ingredients listed in the act, such as snake venom, heavy metals like arsenic and mercury, and compounds like copper sulphate.
For drugs containing these ingredients or traditional drugs being used for new indications, proof of effectiveness is also required.
Notification issued by the AYUSH Ministry
In a contempt case against Patanjali Ayurved Limited, the SC (in May 2024) directed that advertisers should submit self-declarations that they are not misrepresenting or making false claims about products before promoting them in the media.
However, the Ministry of AYUSH (on July 1, 2024) notified that
Rule 170 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 was no longer operational
Why did AYUSH ministry direct licensing authorities to ignore the rule?
In May 2023, the Ayurvedic, Siddha, and Unani Drugs Technical Advisory Board (ASUDTAB) suggested that Rule 170 could be omitted.
ASUDTAB is an expert body that recommends actions relating to regulation of AYUSH drugs.
This is because amendments were being made to the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, 1954 which also regulates misleading advertisements of AYUSH drugs.
In this context, AYUSH ministry recommended ignoring Rule 170, since the other legislative changes would address similar issues.

**********Why are More Undocumented Indian Immigrants Entering the US on Foot
Why in News?
According to new data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an unprecedented number of undocumented Indian immigrants are crossing U.S. borders on foot.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Data on Undocumented Indian Immigration to US
Factors Responsible for the Undocumented Indian Immigration to US
Why has there been an Unprecedented Growth of Undocumented Indians Crossing US Borders in Recent Years?
Data on Undocumented Indian Immigration to US:
In the fiscal year 2022-23
, 96,917 Indians entered the US without papers. It marks
a fivefold increase
from FY 2019-20, when just 19,883 Indians entered the US without papers.
Out of the nearly 97,000 encounters in FY 2022-23, 30,010 were at the Canadian border and 41,770 at the Southern border.
Factors Responsible for the Undocumented Indian Immigration to US:
Overall growth in global migration since the pandemic:
The number of undocumented Indians in the US has been climbing since borders opened post-Covid, with 30,662 encountered in the FY 2021 and 63,927 in the FY 2022.
Unregulated travel agencies in India:
With social media-savvy groups mushrooming as travel agencies, hopeful migrants often pay their life savings to make the journey.
Smugglers using increasingly sophisticated routes:
From the Middle East to Europe to Africa/ South America to the south of Mexico to the northern cities of Mexico, and then finally to the U.S.
Extreme visa backlogs:
Why would one wait for a visitor visa in Delhi if s/he can make it faster to the Southern border of the US?
Unguarded Canadian border:
Canada offers the ideal combination of an accessible visa and a soft border.
It’s a much safer option than taking one of those ‘dunki’ (illegal) routes via West Asia, Africa or the Caribbean, to join the crowd waiting to cross the heavily guarded Mexico border
Push factors:
Oppression of minority communities in India.
The recent spike might have something to do with worsening conditions for minorities like Muslims, Sikhs and Christians in India.
Farmers’ protests:
The scale of the protests that followed a series of laws deregulating India’s agricultural sector in 2020, resulted in a spike in asylum claims.
Pull factors:
The general success of Indian Americans in the US or of previous migrants who have taken the same journey are some of the factors that pull people in.
Decades-long visa backlogs have
made it difficult for would-be immigrants to join their families in the US
, leaving many with little recourse.

**********Is the Administration of Lie-Detector Tests Legally Valid?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
About DDTs (Meaning, Types, Effectiveness, Judicial Intervention, Concerns, Conclusion)
Background:
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recently conducted a second round of polygraph tests on several individuals linked to the rape and murder of a doctor at R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata.
These tests were administered after one of the suspects provided inconsistent answers during questioning.
What are Deception Detection Tests (DDTs)?
Deception Detection Tests are scientific methods used during interrogations to detect lies. These include:
Polygraph Tests:
These measure physiological responses like blood pressure, pulse rate, and skin conductivity to determine if a person is lying.
Narco-Analysis:
A drug-induced state where the subject is believed to be less capable of lying.
A drug called sodium pentothal is injected into the accused.
Brain Mapping:
This method measures brain activity to detect recognition of familiar stimuli, which can indicate deception.
Effectiveness of DDTs:
The effectiveness of these tests is widely debated in the medical community.
In a 2010 paper published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, it was highlighted that lie-detection techniques have been heavily criticized and their
ability to uncover "concealed knowledge in real-world settings" remains uncertain
Similarly, a 2019 study in the United States pointed out high false positive rates and noted that
people can be trained to manipulate the results of a polygraph
Judicial Precedents on Lie-Detector Tests:
Before 2010, Indian courts were supportive of using DDTs in investigations, often not requiring the consent of the accused.
However, in a landmark ruling in
Selvi v. State of Karnataka
(2010), the Supreme Court held that these tests could only be conducted with the consent of the accused, citing the right against self-incrimination under
Article 20(3) of the Constitution
Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India states that
no person accused of an offense can be forced to give evidence or testimony that could incriminate themselves
This is a fundamental right that protects people from being compelled to testify against themselves.
The Court further mandated that
individuals volunteering for such tests must have access to a lawyer
and be apprised of the physical, emotional, and legal implications of undergoing the test.
Additionally, it required that the
subject’s consent be formally recorded before a judicial magistrate
and that the guidelines set out by the National Human Rights Commission in 2000 for administering these tests be strictly adhered to.
Existing Concerns:
Despite the Supreme Court's guidelines, the use of DDTs continues in India, especially in high-profile cases.
There are significant concerns about the coercive nature of these tests and the potential for their misuse, such as extracting false confessions under duress.
Additionally, there is criticism that these tests are not scientifically reliable and that the refusal to undergo such tests is often used unfairly to imply guilt.
Conclusion:
The administration of lie-detector tests in India remains a contentious issue, balancing between the need for effective investigations and the protection of individual rights.
While the Supreme Court has set strict guidelines for their use, the ethical and scientific validity of these tests continues to be debated.
