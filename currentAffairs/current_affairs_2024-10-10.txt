**********What is Rice Fortification?
The Union Cabinet extended the universal supply of fortified rice in all central government schemes providing free food grain under the National Food Security Act, 2021, in its present form, until December 2028.
About
Rice Fortification:
Fortification is the process of
adding Fortified Rice Kernels
(FRK), containing FSSAI-prescribed micronutrients (Iron, Folic Acid, Vitamin B12) to normal Rice in a ratio of 1:100 (Mixing 1 Kg of FRK with 100 Kg custom milled rice).
Fortified rice is
nearly identical to traditional rice
in aroma, taste, and texture. This process is done in the rice mills at the time of milling of rice.
It is a
cost-effective, culturally appropriate strategy
to address micronutrient deficiency in countries with high per capita rice consumption.
Rice Fortification is a 2-step process – (1) Production of Fortified Rice Kernels (FRK)  (2) Blending of rice with FRK
Processes used for rice is fortification
Various technologies, such as
coating, dusting, and ‘extrusion’
, are available to add
micronutrients to regular rice
Adding micronutrient technology involves the production of
Fortified Rice Kernels (FRKs)
from a mixture using an ‘extruder’ machine. It is considered to be the best technology in India.
Dry rice flour is mixed with a
premix of micronutrients
and water is added to this mixture, which is then passed through a twin-screw extruder with heating zones.
Kernels similar in shape and size to rice are produced, which must “resemble the normal milled rice as closely as possible”.
The kernels are dried, cooled, and packaged. FRK has a
shelf life of at least 12 months.
The kernels are blended with regular rice to produce fortified rice. Under the Ministry’s guidelines, 10 g of FRK must be blended with 1 kg of regular rice.
According to FSSAI norms, 1 kg of fortified rice will contain the following: iron (28 mg-42.5 mg), folic acid (75-125 micrograms), and vitamin B-12 (0.75-1.25 microgram).

**********Nobel Prize in Chemistry for Decoding Protein Design and Structures
Why in News?
The 2024 Nobel Prize for chemistry will be shared by (American scientist)
David Baker
“
for computational protein design
” along with (Briton scientist)
Demis Hassabis and
John Jumper “for protein structure prediction.”
Last year the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was jointly awarded to Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Alexei I. Ekimov for the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Why is Work on Protein Important?
What the 2024 Chemistry Nobel was Awarded For?
What Makes the 2024 Chemistry Nobel Significant?
Some Interesting Facts About the 2024 Chemistry Nobel
The role played by proteins:
Proteins are
vital for life
and participate in nearly all biological processes.
For example:
Haemoglobin transports oxygen and Insulin aids in glucose absorption.
Hence, any disruption in protein production can impact human health.
Significance of protein structure:
Made of long chains of 20 different amino acids,
their unique sequences determine their structure and function.
Understanding a protein's shape is key to knowing how it works.
Challenges in determining
Historically, determining protein structures has been slow, often taking months or years using x-ray crystallography.
For creating innovative tool - AlphaFold:
AlphaFold is an
AI tool
created by Hassabis and Jumper that accurately predicts protein structures in a fraction of the time.
It utilises known amino acid sequences to make fast and reliable predictions.
For designing new proteins:
Baker created
Rosetta software
to predict protein structures.
He used Rosetta to reverse-engineer protein design, allowing the creation of new proteins by entering desired structures.
David Baker developed
synthetic proteins
that do not exist in nature.
As his methods are more efficient, it allowed for
quicker development of proteins for specific tasks
, like breaking down plastics.
Simplifies understanding of proteins:
Enhanced visualisation of protein structures helps understand biological functions and disease mechanisms, including antibiotic resistance and microbial degradation of plastics.
Key to understanding critical areas:
The ability to design proteins with novel functions opens doors to:
nanomaterials, targeted pharmaceuticals, rapid vaccine development and environmental solutions
Curing diseases:
These innovations have far-reaching implications for developing new treatments and addressing protein-related diseases.
Recognition to AI:
The Nobel Prize emphasises the transformative role of AI in biological research.
Interesting facts about the 2024 Chemistry Nobel:
Winners:
Baker works at the University of Washington in Seattle and Hassabis and Jumper work at Google DeepMind in London.
Comes relatively quicker:
The Nobel Prize for Hassabis and Jumper comes relatively quickly after the corresponding work (of around 4 to 6 years).
There is usually a gap of a few decades
between the work and the prize because the former doesn’t immediately prove to be of greatest benefit to humankind, which is a criterion for winning.
, John Goodenough shared the 2019 chemistry prize for his work on lithium-ion batteries in the late 1970s.
Given to non-chemists:
The Chemistry Nobel this year also continues a relatively new tradition in this category of the prize going to non-chemists.
In 1981, chemistry laureate Roald Hoffmann interpreted this to be a mark of
chemistry’s far and influential reach
, especially in biochemistry and molecular biology.

**********EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism
Why in the News?
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman called out the European Union’s initiatives such as the
(CBAM) and
Deforestation Rules
as ‘
unilateral
’ and ‘
arbitrary
’ measures.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About CBAM (Meaning, Features, Objective, Scope, Working, etc.)
About Deforestation Rules of EU (Reasons for it being Discriminatory)
News Summary
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism:
The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is a policy initiative by the
(EU) aimed at reducing carbon emissions by imposing a carbon price on imports from countries with less stringent climate policies.
It ensures that imported products face the same carbon costs as those produced within the EU, promoting fair competition and encouraging global decarbonization efforts.
Key Features of CBAM:
Objective:
CBAM aims to
prevent carbon leakage
, where companies shift production to countries with looser carbon regulations to avoid stricter EU climate policies.
It aligns with the EU’s climate goals, particularly its
European Green Deal
, targeting
net-zero emissions by 2050
Scope:
Initially, CBAM covers sectors with high carbon emissions, including
cement, steel, aluminium, fertilizers, electricity
, and
hydrogen
The mechanism calculates the embedded carbon emissions in imported products and imposes an equivalent carbon price.
Implementation Timeline:
2023-2025
: Transition phase where importers report the carbon emissions of their goods without paying the adjustment.
2026
onwards: Full implementation where importers will be required to purchase
CBAM certificates
corresponding to the embedded carbon emissions of their imports.
Working Mechanism of CBAM:
CBAM Certificates:
Importers must buy CBAM certificates to cover the carbon emissions of their imported goods, matching the EU’s
Emissions Trading System
(ETS) price.
The price of CBAM certificates will reflect the EU’s internal carbon price, ensuring a level playing field for domestic and foreign producers.
Calculation of Carbon Emissions:
The carbon footprint of imported goods is calculated based on direct emissions during their production.
If a country already imposes a carbon price, this can be deducted from the CBAM obligation, avoiding double taxation.
Why Developing Countries Like India Find EU’s Deforestation Rules Discriminatory?
The European Union's Deforestation Rules, aimed at preventing the import of
commodities linked to deforestation, have faced criticism from many developing countries.
These countries argue that the rules are discriminatory for several reasons, which largely revolve around issues of fairness, trade barriers, and the economic burden of compliance.
Increased Compliance Costs:
The EU rules require exporters to provide
geolocation data
and prove that commodities like
soy, palm oil, coffee, and cocoa
are not sourced from recently deforested areas.
Small-scale farmers
and producers in developing countries often lack the resources, technology, and expertise to meet these stringent requirements, making compliance
costly
administratively burdensome
These additional costs can make exports from developing countries less competitive in the EU market.
Disadvantage to Agricultural Exports:
Many developing countries are
export-dependent
on agricultural commodities that the EU has identified as high-risk for deforestation, such as
from Indonesia and Malaysia or
from African and Latin American nations.
The rules can act as a
non-tariff barrier
, potentially reducing market access for these countries in the EU.
Limited Recognition of National Efforts:
Many developing countries feel that the EU's rules do not sufficiently recognize their
national efforts
to combat deforestation and implement
sustainable land-use practices
Countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, and Ghana have pointed out that they have
domestic policies
reforestation efforts
in place, yet the EU’s rules impose a one-size-fits-all standard that may not account for these efforts.
This perceived lack of acknowledgment undermines the sovereignty of these countries in managing their own resources.
Unequal Responsibility for Climate Change:
Developing countries argue that the EU’s deforestation rules place
disproportionate responsibility
on them for addressing global environmental issues like deforestation and climate change.
Historically, developed nations have contributed more to
global carbon emissions
and deforestation through industrialization. Yet, developing countries, which often rely on agriculture for economic growth, are being pressured to adhere to stringent standards that may hinder their development.
They view this as a form of
environmental double standards

**********Universal supply of fortified rice till December 2028
Why in news?
The Union cabinet, chaired by PM Modi, approved the continuation of the universal supply of fortified rice under all Union government schemes, including the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), from July 2024 until December 2028.
The rice fortification initiative will continue as a central sector initiative with 100% funding by the Centre as part of PMGKAY (Food Subsidy), thus providing a unified institutional mechanism for implementation.
What’s in today’s article?
Rice fortification
National Food Security Act (NFSA)
About/definition
The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) defines fortification as the deliberate addition of essential micronutrients to food to improve nutritional quality and provide public health benefits, with minimal health risks.
Need for fortification of rice
Malnutrition in India
India faces high levels of malnutrition, especially among women and children.
According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), anaemia affects a significant portion of the population,
with every second woman being anaemic and every third child stunted
Deficiencies in iron, Vitamin B12, and folic acid are widespread, affecting health and productivity.
Fortification of Rice as a Solution
Rice, a staple food for two-thirds of India’s population
, is considered an ideal candidate for fortification to address malnutrition.
Per capita rice consumption in India is 6.8 kg per month, and fortifying it with micronutrients can help supplement the diet of the poor.
Fortification Process
Fortification technologies include coating, dusting, and extrusion, with extrusion being the most suitable for India.
In extrusion, dry rice flour is mixed with micronutrients and water, then passed through an extruder to create fortified rice kernels (FRKs), which resemble regular rice.
These kernels are blended with regular rice in a 10g FRK to 1 kg rice ratio to produce fortified rice.
Nutrient Content in Fortified Rice
According to FSSAI standards, 1 kg of fortified rice contains:
Iron: 28 mg-42.5 mg
Folic acid: 75-125 micrograms
Vitamin B12: 0.75-1.25 micrograms
It may also be fortified with other micronutrients like zinc, vitamin A, and various B vitamins.
Cooking and Consumption of Fortified Rice
Fortified rice is cooked and eaten just like regular rice, and it retains its micronutrient levels after cooking.
Packaging is marked with a logo (‘+F’) and labeled as “Fortified with Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12.”
Progress of the Rice Fortification Initiative
In 2015, PM Modi announced that rice distributed under government schemes, such as the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Mid-Day Meal Scheme, would be fortified by 2024.
The Centre implemented the initiative in phases:
Phase 1
: Integrated Child Development Services and PM POSHAN by March 2022.
Phase 2
: PDS and welfare schemes in 112 Aspirational Districts by March 2023.
Phase 3:
Full nationwide coverage by March 2024.
Cost and Scale of the Initiative
The annual cost of
rice fortification is about ₹2,700 crore, less than 2% of India’s food subsidy bill
From 2019 to March 2024, 406 lakh metric tonnes of fortified rice have been distributed through the PDS.
There are 925 fortified rice manufacturers with a capacity of 111 lakh metric tonnes per annum, and rice mills have a capacity of 223 lakh metric tonnes for blending.
The government has invested ₹11,000 crore in developing the fortified rice supply chain.
Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY)
PM-GKAY is a food security welfare scheme announced by the Central Government in March 2020, during the
Covid-19 pandemic
It is a part of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) to help the poor fight the battle against Covid-19.
Objective
To feed the poorest citizens of India by providing grain through the Public Distribution System, to all the
priority households
(ration card holders and those identified by the Antyodaya Anna Yojana scheme).
Launched in 2000,
is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme to provide highly subsidised food to millions of the poorest families.
Entitlement
The eligible ration cardholders under NFSA 2013 were entitled to 5 kg free wheat/rice per person per month.
This was in addition to the 5 kg food grains already provided to the beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, 2013.
Implementing Agency
Department of Food and Public Distribution, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.
Merger of PM-GKAY and NFSA
In December 2022, the
Government amalgamated PMGKAY with NFSA
After the merger, the entire quantity of 5 kg and 35 kg under the NFSA was made available free of cost.
With this, India has a Central food security legislation which gives the poor a ‘right’ to receive 5 kg foodgrains free of cost.
Earlier, beneficiaries paid a small price of Rs 3 per kg for rice and Rs 2 per kg for wheat.
Extension of PM-GKAY
The scheme was extended for five years, starting January 1, 2024.
It was previously extended until December 31, 2023
The NFSA, 2013 was notified to provide for food and nutritional security, by ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices to people to live a life with dignity.
It provides
a legal right
to persons belonging to “eligible households” to receive food grains at subsidised price
central issue prices under the under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS).
State governments are tasked with identifying Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY - poorest of the poor) and priority households (PHH) beneficiaries within the TPDS-covered population.
Every person in the PHH category receives 5 kg of food grains per month at -
rice at Rs 3/kg, wheat at Rs 2/kg and coarse grain at Re 1/kg.
Each Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) h
ousehold gets Rs 35 kg of food grains per month
The Act covers up to 75% of the rural population and up to 50% of the urban population for receiving subsidised food grains (overall
67
% of the total population).

**********Monetary Policy Committee Meeting 2024
Why in news?
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced its fourth bi-monthly monetary policy for FY25 on October 9, 2024.
The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5%, marking the
tenth consecutive time the rate
has remained steady. Five out of six MPC members voted in favour of maintaining the current rate.
What’s in today’s article?
Current domestic and global situation
Key highlights of the MPC meeting
The Committee
Under Section 45ZB of the amended RBI Act, 1934, the central government is empowered to
constitute a six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).
MPC will determine the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target. The first such MPC was constituted in September 2016.
Members of MPC
As per the amended RBI act, the MPC shall consist of
the RBI Governor as its ex officio chairperson,
the Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy,
an officer of the Bank to be nominated by the Central Board, and
three persons to be appointed by the central government.
Functions of MPC
Setting Policy Interest Rates
: The primary function of the MPC is to determine the policy interest rates, specifically the repo rate.
Inflation Targeting
: The current inflation target set by the government is a Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation target of 4% with a tolerance band of +/- 2%.
Economic Analysis and Forecasting
: The MPC conducts thorough analysis and forecasting of various economic indicators, including inflation, GDP growth, employment, fiscal conditions, and global economic developments.
Decision-Making
: The MPC meets at least four times a year to review the monetary policy stance.
Current domestic and global situation against which the MPC meeting was held
Domestic growth has continued its strong momentum, and the global economy has shown resilience since the last meeting.
However, risks remain due to geopolitical conflicts, financial market instability, and high public debt.
On the bright side, world trade is showing signs of recovery.
Key Policy rates remain unchanged
Repo Rate
- The repo rate now stands at 6.50 per cent.
Repo rate is the rate at which the Reserve Bank of India lends money to commercial banks in the event of any shortfall of funds.
The standing deposit facility (SDF)
- This rate stands at 6.25%.
The SDF is a liquidity window through which the RBI will give banks an option to park excess liquidity with it.
It is different from the reverse repo facility in that it does not require banks to provide collateral while parking funds.
The idea of an SDF was first mooted in the
Urjit Patel Monetary Policy
Committee report
in 2014.
It later received the government’s nod following an amendment to the RBI Act in 2018, vide the Finance Bill.
The marginal standing facility (MSF) rate
– It stands at 6.75%.
MSF is a window for banks to borrow from the central bank in an emergency situation when inter-bank liquidity dries up completely.
The Bank Rate
- It is now 6.75%.
Bank rate is the rate charged by the central bank for lending funds to commercial banks.
There is a slight difference between Bank Rate and Repo Rate. In Repo Rate, RBI lends money to the banks against securities for the short term only.
Policy stance changed
The RBI has changed its policy stance changed to ‘
Neutral
from ‘Withdrawal of Accommodation
’.
Withdrawal of accommodation
- It means reducing the money supply in the system to control inflation. It rules out the option of cutting rates.
Neutral stance -
This means that the central bank is open to either increasing or decreasing interest rates, depending on data related to inflation and economic growth
GDP projection
India’s real GDP grew by 6.7 per cent in Q1.
For FY25, the RBI kept its gross domestic product (GDP) projection unchanged at 7.2 per cent.
Inflation projection
The MPC projected inflation at
5 per cent for FY25
, the same as previously forecast.
The RBI reported that headline inflation dropped significantly to 3.6% in July and 3.7% in August from 5.1% in June.
However, the RBI warned that September inflation could rise due to adverse base effects and higher food prices, though food inflation is expected to ease by Q4 FY25 with better kharif and rabi harvests.
Core inflation is likely to remain contained
, influencing the RBI’s shift to a 'Neutral' policy stance.
Despite efforts to control inflation, risks such as unfavorable weather, geopolitical tensions, and rising food and metal prices could push inflation higher in the coming months.
Reserve Bank Climate Risk Information System (RB-CRIS)
The RBI proposed to create a climate risk data repository, the RB-CRIS, to address gaps in climate-related data.
It will have two parts: a publicly accessible web-based directory of data sources like meteorological and geospatial information, and a data portal with
standardized datasets available only to regulated entities in phases
Enhancement of transaction and wallet limits
for UPI
UPI Lite Wallet Limit Increased
The RBI has increased the UPI Lite wallet limit from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 and per-transaction limit for the same from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000.
UPI Lite operates without using real-time core banking systems, while ensuring risk mitigation.
UPI Lite is a simplified version of UPI that lets users make small transactions without a UPI PIN.
UPI123 Pay Transaction Limit Enhanced
The per-transaction limit for UPI123 Pay has been increased to ₹10,000 from ₹5,000. This feature is now available in 12 languages, broadening accessibility.
UPI 123PAY is a payment system mainly for non-smart phone/feature phone user by which they can make payment using UPI without Internet in a safe and secure manner.
Beneficiary Account Name Look-up Facility
The RBI proposed a new ‘beneficiary account name look-up facility’ for RTGS and NEFT transactions.
This feature allows remitters to verify the beneficiary’s name by entering the account number and branch IFSC code, reducing the chances of incorrect transfers and fraud.
Foreclosure Charges on MSE Loans Removed
To promote transparency and customer-centric lending, the RBI has banned foreclosure charges and pre-payment penalties on loans to micro and small enterprises (MSEs).
Foreclosure refers to the complete repayment of the outstanding loan amount before the end of the loan tenure.
E.g., If one takes a home loan for 10 years but decides to repay the entire loan in 5 years, the lender might charge a fee for doing so.
Pre-payment is when a borrower pays off a part of the loan early (in addition to regular monthly payments).
E.g., If you pay an extra ₹1 lakh towards your home loan principal, in addition to your regular EMI, the lender may impose a penalty for reducing the loan balance early.
Additionally, banks and NBFCs are prohibited from levying such charges on floating rate term loans to individuals for non-business purposes.

**********What is the Samsung worker’s strike in Chennai about?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Wage issues in India;
Why in the News?
Approximately two-thirds of workers at Samsung’s flagship factory in Chennai have been on strike for a month, demanding higher wages, an eight-hour workday, improved conditions, and union recognition.
What are the main demands of the striking workers?
Higher Wages
: Workers are demanding increased salaries to improve their financial conditions.
Eight-Hour Work Day
: The employees seek the implementation of an eight-hour workday to ensure better work-life balance.
Better Working Conditions
: Strikers are advocating for improved health and safety standards in the workplace.
Recognition of Labour Union
: The workers want formal acknowledgment of their recently formed union, the Samsung India Workers Union (SIWU).
What is Samsung’s union policy?
Historically, Samsung has maintained a strict no-union policy for over 80 years, resisting any collective bargaining efforts by employees.
In July 2021, the company began to recognize unions after successful negotiations at Samsung Display and Samsung Electronics, allowing for some degree of collective bargaining.
Samsung now has various unions representing its workforce globally, with significant representation in South Korea.
Why was SIWU unrecognised?
Registration Challenges
: SIWU’s registration has been opposed by Samsung management, citing trademark violations due to the use of the name “Samsung” in the union’s title.
Legal Precedents
: SIWU argues that trademark issues should not apply, as their activities do not involve commercial undertakings that could infringe on the trademark.
Pending Legal Review
: The case regarding SIWU’s registration is pending further court hearings, with the government examining objections raised by the management.
What has been the govt.’s response?
Indifferent Stance
: SIWU and the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) have accused the Tamil Nadu government of being indifferent and supportive of Samsung management, which the government denies.
Support for Workers’ Rights
: The government claims it considers the registration application in light of Samsung’s objections and aims to ensure fair treatment of both workers and management.
CITU’s Position
: Union leaders assert that government intervention in favor of management undermines the rights of workers and can deter unionization efforts, despite evidence showing that unions can benefit both employees and companies.
Present Legislation in India:
Notice Period and Conditions for Strikes:
Under the
Industrial Relations Code, 2020,
workers must provide a 14-day notice before striking, which cannot exceed a maximum of 60 days.
Strike definition:
The definition of a strike now includes “mass casual leave,” where over 50% of employees taking leave can be classified as a strike.
Increased Flexibility for Employers:
The code has increased the threshold for layoffs from 100 to 300 workers, allowing companies to lay off employees without government approval.
This change aims to give employers greater flexibility in managing their workforce, which has
raised concerns
among labor unions about job security and workers’ rights.
Way forward:
Facilitate Dialogue and Mediation
: Establish a formal dialogue between the workers, Samsung management, and government representatives to address grievances, negotiate demands, and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
Strengthen Legal Framework for Union Recognition
: Amend or clarify existing labor laws to ensure timely and transparent registration processes for unions, protecting their rights and enabling effective collective bargaining.
**********Fairwork India report highlights the absence of local living wage for gig workers, aggregators turning their back to collectivization
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to gig workers;
Why in the News?
The ‘Fairwork India Ratings 2024’ highlights that platform aggregators in India fail to ensure local living wages and resist recognizing the collective rights of workers.
Who are the Gig Workers?
Gig workers are individuals who take up
short-term, flexible work assignments,
typically managed via digital platforms. In the Indian context, gig workers operate in various sectors such as
food delivery, ride-hailing, logistics, and personal/domestic care services.
These workers are
not considered employees
in the traditional sense and often lack the benefits associated with full-time employment, such as job security, healthcare, and social protection.
Examples of platforms using gig workers include Swiggy, Zomato (food delivery) Uber, Ola (transportation), etc.
Key highlights as per the report:
No Platform Scored Perfectly
: No digital labor platform scored more than 6 out of 10 points, and none met all criteria across the five principles — Fair Pay, Fair Conditions, Fair Contracts, Fair Management, and Fair Representation.
: Only BigBasket and Urban Company ensured a minimum wage, but no platform met the criteria for guaranteeing a living wage after work-related costs.
: Several platforms (e.g., Amazon Flex, Swiggy, Zepto) provided safety equipment and training, but only a few offered comprehensive accident insurance and income loss compensation.
: BigBasket, Swiggy, and others made contracts accessible and comprehensible, and provided data protection for workers.
: Platforms like BluSmart and Zomato implemented processes for addressing grievances and preventing discrimination.
Present Status of Gig Economy  in India:
Growth of the Gig Economy
: India is witnessing rapid growth in the gig economy, with millions of workers depending on digital platforms for their livelihoods.
The rise of app-based platforms such as
Uber, Zomato,
has driven the expansion of gig work across
urban areas.
Government Focus
: Recent years have seen increasing political and legislative attention to gig worker welfare. Karnataka and Jharkhand are examples of states that have proposed new legislation to regulate platform work and protect gig workers’ rights.
Worker Conditions
: Despite the expansion of gig work, platforms in India still lag in ensuring fair pay, safety, and management of gig workers.
reveal that no platform scored above
6 out of 10,
signaling considerable gaps in adhering to key labor standards.
Challenges faced by the Gig Economy
Low Wages and Unstable Earnings
: Many platforms fail to ensure a local living wage for workers after accounting for work-related costs. Only a few platforms like
Bigbasket
guarantee the local minimum wage, but none meet the standard of ensuring a living wage.
Lack of Social Security and Benefits
: Most gig workers lack access to benefits such as healthcare, insurance, and paid leave. While a few platforms provide accident insurance, broader social security protections remain elusive.
Poor Working Conditions
: Platforms often do not ensure adequate safety training or measures. While some like
offer basic safety equipment and training, broader protections, especially in terms of income loss and sick leave, are limited.
Inflexible Contracts
: Contracts on platforms are frequently unclear, lengthy, and not always comprehensible for workers, making it difficult for them to fully understand their rights and obligations.
Management Issues and Bias
: Workers face arbitrary decisions and discipline without proper recourse. Though some platforms have mechanisms for workers to appeal decisions, few have adopted policies to ensure fairness in work allocation.
Collectivization Challenges
: Platforms resist recognizing gig workers’ right to form unions or collective bodies. Despite the growing movement for gig worker collectivization, no platform showed evidence of supporting or acknowledging these efforts.
Way forward:
Strengthen Legal Protections and Social Security
: Introduce comprehensive legislation ensuring gig workers receive fair wages, social security benefits like healthcare and insurance, and clear, comprehensible contracts.
Promote Worker Representation and Fair Management
: Encourage platforms to recognize collective bodies of gig workers, ensuring their right to unionize. Implement transparent and bias-free management practices, along with grievance redressal mechanisms, to improve working conditions and fairness.
**********What is fortified rice? Why did the Centre extend the initiative for its distribution of schemes
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Significance of food fortification;
Why in the News?
On October 9, 2024, the Union Cabinet approved extending the free fortified rice supply under welfare programs until December 2028.
Why Rice Fortification is needed?
Widespread Micronutrient Deficiency:
India faces a significant public health challenge with micronutrient deficiencies, particularly
iron, Vitamin B12, and folic acid. Anaemia
, caused by iron deficiency, is a persistent issue affecting large segments of the population, including children, women, and men.
Rice as a Staple Food:
Given that
65% of India’s population
consumes rice as a staple, it is an ideal vehicle to deliver essential micronutrients to combat these deficiencies, helping improve overall health, productivity, and cognitive development.
Process of Rice Fortification:
Fortified Rice Kernels (FRK):
The process involves producing fortified rice kernels that are enriched with essential micronutrients such as
Iron, Folic Acid
Blending with Regular Rice:
These fortified kernels are then blended with regular rice at a ratio prescribed by
FSSAI
(Food Safety and Standards Authority of India).
Typically, fortified kernels make up 1-2% of the total rice, ensuring consistent delivery of micronutrients without altering the taste or cooking properties of the rice.
How the Fortification Initiative has fared so far?
The rice fortification scheme was implemented in three phases between 2022 and March 2024, with the target of achieving universal coverage in all government schemes by March 2024 successfully met.
Fortified rice is now supplied under major welfare programs like the
Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), Integrated Child Development Service (ICDS),
PM POSHAN
in all states and Union Territories.
The initiative is fully funded by the
central government
, highlighting its commitment to tackling malnutrition and ensuring inclusive nutritional security across the country.
How can food fortification help reduce malnutrition in India?
Combats Micronutrient Deficiencies
: Fortifying staple foods with essential nutrients like iron and vitamins helps reduce widespread deficiencies that cause anemia and poor health.
Wide Reach
: Through existing public programs (PDS, ICDS), fortified food reaches vulnerable populations, ensuring consistent nutrient intake for large segments of society.
Cost-Effective
: It offers a scalable, affordable solution to malnutrition, improving health outcomes without significant changes in diets or eating habits.
Way forward:
Strengthen Monitoring and Quality Control:
Implement robust monitoring mechanisms to ensure the consistent quality of fortified rice and its proper distribution across welfare programs to maximize nutritional benefits.
Raise Awareness and Promote Consumption:
Conduct awareness campaigns to educate the public on the health benefits of fortified rice, ensuring higher acceptance and consistent consumption to address widespread micronutrient deficiencies.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Trachoma; Its causes and treatment
Why in the News?
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that India has
successfully eliminated Trachoma
as a public health problem.
This makes
third country
in the Southeast Asia Region
to achieve this milestone
WHO has classified
neglected tropical disease
(NTD).
WHO estimates that around
150 million people
worldwide are affected by Trachoma, and
6 million of them are either blind or at risk
of severe visual problems.
Trachoma is
commonly found in underprivileged communities
living in poor conditions.
What is Trachoma?
Trachoma is a
bacterial infection
that affects the
eyes
It is caused by the
bacterium Chlamydia Trachomatis
contagious
, spreading through
contact with the eyes
eyelids
or secretions
from the nose or throat of an infected person.
If untreated, Trachoma can lead to irreversible blindness.
Trachoma in India: A Historical Perspective
In the 1950s and 1960s, Trachoma was one of the leading causes of blindness in India.
To tackle this, India launched the
National Trachoma Control Program in 1963
Later, these efforts were integrated into India’s
National Program for Control of Blindness (NPCB)
In 1971, the rate of blindness due to trachoma was 5% in the country.
Due to various interventions under the
National Programme for Control of Blindness & Visual Impairment (NPCBVI)
, the rate has now dropped to less than 1%.
What are the key measures taken to eliminate Trachoma?
India implemented the WHO SAFE strategy across the country. This strategy includes:
Surgery
Antibiotics
Facial hygiene
Environmental cleanliness
Although by 2017, India was declared free from infective Trachoma, it continued surveillance of Trachoma cases from 2019 to 2024.
