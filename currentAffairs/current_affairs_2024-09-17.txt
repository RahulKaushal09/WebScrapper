Article 324 of the Indian Constitution
Under
of the Constitution, the
Election Commission of India (ECI)
is granted the authority to oversee and manage elections.
The ECI ensures that the election process is completed before the five-year term of the Assembly ends.
The Representation of the People Act, 1951
According to
Section 15(2) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951
, elections cannot be announced less than
six months
before the Assembly's term ends, unless the Assembly is dissolved earlier.
Things the ECI looks at before deciding the election schedule
The new Assembly (or Lok Sabha) must be constituted before the end of the current Assembly’s term, meaning the election process, including all formalities, must be completed beforehand.
The ECI works backward from the end date, considering factors like weather, security availability, festivals, training of officers, and procurement of EVMs.
Before finalizing the election schedule, the ECI consults local administration and police and attempts to align voting in states where elections are due around the same time.
Article 174(2)(b)
of the Constitution allows the Governor to dissolve the Legislative Assembly, and the Council of Ministers can recommend early dissolution.
Once dissolved, the Election Commission must conduct elections within six months.
In 2018, Telangana's Assembly was dissolved early on the Cabinet's recommendation, and elections were held before the term ended.
Delhi is not a full state
is governed by the
Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991
, under which the
Lieutenant Governor (LG)
can dissolve the Assembly, but the final decision lies with the Centre.
Section 6(2)(b) of the Act says the Lieutenant Governor may from time to time dissolve the Assembly, even if a Chief Minister of Delhi recommends the dissolution of the Assembly, the final say is the Centre’s (through the LG).
Despite the current Delhi CM’s intention to resign and call for early elections, he has not recommended dissolving the Assembly.
His successor might be decided after a meeting of AAP MLAs.
The current state of preparedness for elections in Delhi
The ECI is currently focused on conducting elections for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, with voting in three phases from September 18 to October 1.
Following this, elections in Haryana will be held on October 5, and counting for both Haryana and J&K will take place on October 8.
The next Assembly elections will be in Maharashtra and Jharkhand, whose terms end in November 2024 and January 2025, respectively.
A special summary revision of the electoral rolls is conducted a few months before elections.
The electoral rolls for J&K, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand were published in August,
while Delhi’s updated rolls will be published on January 6, 2025, as part of the annual revision
Hence it can be said that Delhi is not preoccupying the ECI currently.

What’s in today’s article?
Precision farming
Precision farming (PF) in India
Proposal to launch scheme to boost precision farming
About
Precision farming, also known as precision agriculture, is a modern agricultural practice that uses advanced technology like GPS, sensors, data analytics, drones, and remote sensing to monitor and manage crop production with high accuracy.
The goal is to
optimize inputs (like water, fertilizers, and pesticides) based on site-specific conditions to maximize yield, minimize waste, and reduce environmental impact
Benefits
Increased Productivity:
By monitoring field variability, farmers can tailor inputs to meet the specific needs of crops, leading to improved yield and efficiency.
Resource Optimization:
Precision farming ensures judicious use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides, reducing waste and lowering production costs.
Environmental Benefits:
Reducing the use of chemicals minimizes soil and water contamination, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
Risk Management:
Through real-time data collection and analysis, farmers can make informed decisions, reducing risks related to unpredictable weather and crop diseases.
Challenges
High Initial Cost:
Implementing precision farming technologies requires significant investment in tools and infrastructure, which can be a barrier for small farmers.
Technical Expertise:
Farmers need to be trained to use precision tools, interpret data, and implement the findings in their agricultural practices.
Digital Divide:
Access to reliable internet connectivity, especially in rural areas, limits the adoption of precision farming in many regions.
Data Management:
Processing and interpreting large amounts of data requires specialized software and skills, which are not always available to small-scale farmers.
Context
As a modern approach to farming, precision agriculture focuses on all aspects of resources (soil, water, nutrients) required for farming.
However
, in India, the practice is so far developed for nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) and water-use efficiency (WUE).
PF in the Indian landscape is yet to become an integral part of mainstream farming systems.
Steps taken
National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)
, which focus on water-use efficiency and soil health monitoring.
The government has also promoted the use of
drones, soil health cards, and satellite-based monitoring
The government has also announced a
Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)
for agriculture that will provide farmers with access to technology and information.
PF technology is being developed and disseminated through the
22 Precision Farming Development Centres
in the country.
Agriculture Infrastructure Fund
(AIF), launched during Covid-19, has provisions for financing infrastructure projects for smart and precision agriculture.
Also, funds are released to states/UTs for projects involving use of AI and machine learning, under schemes like the
National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture
Area Under Precision Farming
Precision farming in India is still at a nascent stage, with a limited area under coverage, mostly in states like Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh.
The technology has been mainly adopted in large commercial farms and regions with advanced irrigation facilities.
Challenges in India
Fragmented Land Holdings
: The small size of farms in India poses a challenge for the large-scale implementation of precision farming technologies.
Cost and Awareness
: Small farmers often lack awareness and resources to invest in high-tech solutions.
Infrastructure Gaps
: Lack of robust digital infrastructure in rural India limits the reach of precision farming tools.
Scheme to promote precision farming
The Indian government is planning to allocate Rs 6,000 crore to promote precision farming.
It will utilize smart technologies like IoT, AI, drones, and data analytics to enhance productivity and resource efficiency while reducing environmental impacts.
is working on launching a
Coverage
The scheme will cover 15,000 acres of land in five years from 2024-25 to 2028-29 and is expected to benefit about 60,000 farmers.
Role of Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) in promoting precision farming
Currently, the AIF has provisions for financing infrastructure projects for smart and precision agriculture.
Under AIF, individual farmers as well as farmers’ communities such as Farmer Producer Organization, Primary Agricultural Credit Societies and SHGs are eligible for loans with
interest subvention of 3% for using technological solutions in farm practices
These practices include:
farm/ harvest automation;
purchase of drones, putting up specialised sensors on field;
use of blockchain and AI in agriculture;
remote sensing and Internet of Things (IoT).
Collaboration with other countries to promote precision farming in India
The government is also collaborating with countries like the
Netherlands
Israel
for advanced farming solutions, with a plan to establish
100 Centres of Excellence (CoEs)
in five years.
Already,
32 Indo-Israel CoEs
have been set up in 14 states.

**********How do Emergency Provisions Impact Centre-State Relations?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Emergency Provisions (Articles 355 & 356, Historical Context, Judicial Interpretations, Recommendations from Commissions, Case of Manipur, etc.)
Introduction:
The recent surge in violence in Manipur has reignited discussions on the Centre-State relations in India, particularly regarding the use of emergency provisions.
These provisions allow the central government to intervene in the affairs of state governments under specific circumstances.
India's Federal Structure:
India operates under a federal system, where governance is shared between the Centre and the States.
The Constitution, through its
Seventh Schedule
, divides powers between the two levels of government.
Law and order are primarily the responsibility of the State governments.
However, in cases where there is a breakdown of governance, the Centre has the authority to intervene under certain emergency provisions.
Understanding Emergency Provisions:
The emergency provisions are encapsulated in
Part XVIII of the Constitution
, specifically
Article 355 mandates the Centre to protect states from external aggression and internal disturbances, while ensuring that state governments function according to the Constitution.
Article 356 grants the Centre the power to impose President's Rule in a state if it fails to comply with constitutional norms.
These provisions are unique to India, as similar federal systems like the U.S. and Australia do not allow the central government to remove state governments.
Historical Context and Judicial Interpretation:
B.R. Ambedkar, while drafting these provisions, expressed hope that they would remain unused.
Article 356 has been misused on numerous occasions to remove state governments
, often for political reasons.
It was only after the landmark 1994 Supreme Court judgment in the
R. Bommai case
that limitations were imposed on the use of Article 356.
The court ruled that
it could only be invoked in cases of a constitutional breakdown
, not merely for a law-and-order issue.
Additionally, the
court emphasized that the imposition of President's Rule would be subject to judicial review
On the other hand, the scope of Article 355 has expanded through various court rulings.
Initially interpreted narrowly, cases like
Naga People's Movement of Human Rights vs Union of India
(1998) have broadened its application, allowing the Centre to take a wider range of actions to fulfil its duty of protecting states.
Recommendations from Various Commissions:
Several commissions have examined the use of emergency provisions in Centre-State relations.
Sarkaria Commission (1987)
National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (2002)
, and the
Punchhi Commission (2010)
all concur that Article 355 places a duty on the Union government, but any actions under Article 356 should be used as a last resort.
They emphasize that it should only be invoked in extreme situations.
The Case of Manipur:
The violence in Manipur has brought the issue of emergency provisions to the forefront once again.
The situation in the state, marked by widespread violence, looting of police ammunition, and targeted attacks, goes beyond a simple law-and-order breakdown.
Yet, despite the severity of the crisis, Article 356 has not been invoked.
This is likely due to political considerations, as the same party holds power both at the Centre and the State.
However, Article 355 is being utilized, and the Centre is taking steps to restore normalcy through various instructions and actions.
Conclusion:
While India's federal structure emphasizes state autonomy, emergency provisions like Articles 355 and 356 give the Centre considerable power to intervene when necessary.
However, these provisions must be used judiciously to maintain the delicate balance between the Centre and the States.
The situation in Manipur highlights the complexities of this relationship, where political, constitutional, and legal factors all play a role in determining the extent of the Centre’s involvement.
