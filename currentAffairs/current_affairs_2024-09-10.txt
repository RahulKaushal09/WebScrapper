The role of district Agro- Meteorology offices in supporting farmer
Why in news?
According to media reports, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is planning to revive District Agro-Meteorology Units (DAMUs) under the Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) scheme.
The IMD initially established 199 DAMUs in 2018 in collaboration with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). These units were created to utilize weather data for generating and distributing sub-district-level agricultural advisories to help farmers make informed decisions.
However, in March, the IMD ordered the shutdown of DAMUs. The revival plan is now aimed at reinstating these units to support agricultural activities using weather-based insights.

About
The GKMS scheme is an initiative by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) aimed at providing weather-based agricultural advisories to farmers.
The primary goal is to enhance farmers' decision-making related to agricultural activities, thus helping them mitigate risks due to adverse weather conditions and improve crop productivity.
Features
Weather Forecasts
- The IMD generates medium-range weather forecasts for different agricultural regions at district and sub-district levels.
These forecasts typically cover 5-7 days and include parameters like rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction.
Agro-meteorological Advisory Services (AAS) -
The IMD provides weather-based bulletins to help farmers manage their crops and livestock. The advisories are available in local languages.
Dissemination
- The advisories are shared with farmers through multiple channels, including SMS, mobile apps, radio, television, and local government bodies.
- As part of the GKMS scheme, DAMUs were set up to decentralize weather data analysis and advisory dissemination to the sub-district level.
The DAMU project is a collaboration between the IMD and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).
The main activity of a DAMU is to support farm planners and farmers by providing advance weather information.
This is done through block-level agro-meteorological advisory bulletins, helping farmers with day-to-day agricultural operations, minimizing crop losses, and ensuring efficient use of land and natural resources.
Importance of DAMU
Around 80% of Indian farmers are small and marginal, relying heavily on rain-fed agriculture, which is increasingly impacted by climate change.
Experts have highlighted the importance of providing farmers with weather information due to shifting monsoon patterns, extended dry spells, and heavy rainfall.
DAMUs, located within Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), play a key role by using weather data from the IMD to prepare agricultural advisories.
These advisories, related to activities like sowing, irrigation, and early warnings for extreme weather, are sent to millions of farmers free of cost, in local languages, twice a week.
Disseminated through text messages, WhatsApp, newspapers, and in-person communication, these advisories help farmers plan better and mitigate risks
A policy brief by the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS) highlighted the benefits of DAMUs in regions like Kalyana-Karnataka.
In this region, localized advisories improved farmers' ability to respond to climate variations, leading to higher yields and incomes.
Why were DAMUs shut down?
According to a report, NITI Aayog misrepresented the role of District Agro-Meteorology Units (DAMUs) and advocated for privatization.
NITI Aayog falsely claimed that
agro-met data was automated
, undermining the critical role of DAMU staff in preparing block-level agricultural advisories based on IMD weather data.
Additionally, NITI Aayog proposed monetizing agro-met services, which are currently provided free to all farmers.

**********Copper Production in India
Why in News?
Though copper demand is poised to surge over the next decade across geographies, the production of copper ore in India fell to 3.78 million tonnes (Mt) in FY24 from 4.13 Mt in FY19, according to the Ministry of Mines data.
As a result, copper concentrate imports have doubled to Rs 26,000 crore in FY24 from FY19, and Indian smelters and refiners are now increasingly looking to secure copper assets overseas.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Copper Metal and its Reserves in India
Copper Ore Production in India
Current Status of Copper Ore Production in India
Copper Metal and its Reserves in India:
About the metal:
Copper is a
soft, malleable, and ductile
metal with very
high thermal and electrical conductivity
Copper is one of the few metals that
occurs in nature
in directly usable metallic form (native metals).
It is an important
non-ferrous
base metal having
wide industrial applications
, ranging from defence, space programme, railways, power cables, mint, telecommunication cables, etc.
India has around 2% of the world reserve of copper.
Largest reserves/ resources of copper ore to the tune of 813 million tonnes/ Mt (53.81% of the total all India resources) are in the State of
Rajasthan
followed by Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh.
The Khetri Mine
, which is one of the largest copper mines in India, is located in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan.
Copper reserves/ resources are also found in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, etc.
Copper Ore Production in India:
India's copper production is about 2%
of the world's copper production and it is
not self-sufficient
in the production of copper ore.
The domestic demand for copper and its alloys is met through
domestic production, recycling of scrap and by imports.
In addition to domestic production of ore and concentrates, India imports copper concentrates for its smelters.
In the copper value chain
, copper concentrate is smelted into copper anode, which is then refined into copper cathode/ refined copper, which is essential for producing rods, sheets, wires, and other input goods.
Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL)
, a Public Sector Undertaking, is the only integrated Company in the country that is involved in mining and beneficiation of ore and is engaged in smelting, refining and casting of refined copper.
Hindalco Industries Ltd and Vedanta Limited
are the major copper producers in the Private Sector that mainly rely on imported copper concentrates.
These companies own copper mines in other countries.
Current Status of Copper Ore Production in India:
Exploration lags:
In India, copper ore reserves stand at an estimated 208 Mt, most of which are of low grade.
Copper resources (total 1.51 billion tonnes) require extensive exploration to convert resources into reserves that are viable for mining.
The National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET)
, under the Ministry of Mines, oversees mineral block exploration in India.
Insufficient exploration and a lack of private sector participation
over the last decade have hindered the development of new mines.
For example,
in FY24 and FY23, NMET approved only two copper exploration projects.
In 2023, the Ministry of Mines
modified rules
to encourage private exploration agencies to explore critical minerals like copper.
Increasing reliance on imports:
Copper has been designated as a critical mineral,
and its role in clean energy technologies - like wind turbines and EV batteries - has put India’s growing import reliance in the spotlight.
From developing new import sources in copper-rich countries like
Mongolia
to buying equity in
Zambian and Chilean
mines, major private players are collaborating with the Ministry of Mines in securing India’s copper supply chain.

**********Challenges to Road Safety in India
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Road Safety in India (Current State, Statistics, Challenges, Comparison, Way Forward, etc.)
Background:
Road safety remains a critical public health issue in India, with a high number of fatalities and injuries resulting from road accidents every year.
The "
India Status Report on Road Safety 2024
," prepared by the TRIP Centre at
IIT Delhi
, sheds light on the slow progress made in reducing road accident deaths and emphasizes the need for focused interventions.
This article delves into the key findings of the report, the current state of road safety in India, and potential strategies for improvement.
The Current State of Road Safety in India:
Disparities in Road Accident Death Rates:
The report highlights significant disparities in road accident death rates across different states in India.
Some states, such as Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Chhattisgarh, report high death rates of over
17 per 100,000 people
On the other hand, states like West Bengal and Bihar have much lower rates, around 5.9 per 100,000 people.
Despite improvements in other sectors, road traffic injuries continue to be a major cause of death and health loss in India.
In 2021, road injuries were the 13th leading cause of death and the 12th leading cause of health loss
, as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).
Alarmingly, in six states, including Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, road injuries ranked among the top ten causes of health loss.
Vulnerability of Motorcyclists and Pedestrians:
Motorcyclists, pedestrians, and cyclists are particularly vulnerable to road accidents in India.
The report reveals that two-wheeler riders, in particular, face high risks, with low helmet usage contributing significantly to fatalities.
Shockingly, in only seven states, more than half of two-wheeler riders wear helmets, despite the fact that helmets can drastically reduce the risk of death and serious injury.
Trucks are another major cause of accidents. They are often involved in fatal crashes, contributing to the high number of deaths on India’s roads.
Lack of Road Safety Measures:
Most Indian states are struggling to implement basic traffic safety measures. Traffic calming mechanisms, road markings, and signage are often lacking, especially in rural areas.
Furthermore, only a few states have conducted audits of their highways to assess road safety, leaving many stretches of road without adequate safety infrastructure.
Trauma Care and Response:
The inadequacy of trauma care facilities is another significant issue. In many parts of India, especially rural areas, access to timely medical care after a road accident is limited.
This lack of infrastructure contributes to higher fatality rates, as victims do not receive critical care quickly enough.
Importance of Crash Surveillance:
One of the major challenges in improving road safety is the lack of a robust national crash surveillance system.
Currently, road safety data in India is compiled from First Information Reports (FIRs) filed at police stations, which are then aggregated at district, state, and national levels.
However, this system only allows for basic analyses and often contains inaccurate information.
The report calls for the establishment of a comprehensive national database for fatal crashes
, which would allow for better analysis of road safety risks and more effective interventions.
Such a system would provide policymakers with the tools needed to identify specific risk factors and evaluate the success of road safety programs.
India’s Global Road Safety Standing:
When compared to developed countries, India's road safety performance is alarming.
In 1990, an Indian was 40% more likely to die in a road accident than someone in countries like Sweden. By 2021, this figure had risen to a staggering 600%.
While Scandinavian countries have excelled in road safety governance, India’s progress has been slow, leading to a sharp rise in road fatalities.
The report also questions whether simply equipping vehicles with advanced safety features is enough to solve India’s road safety problem.
Since two-wheeler riders, pedestrians, and cyclists account for the majority of fatalities, focusing on vulnerable road users is critical.
Way Forward - Strategies to Improve Road Safety:
Scale-Up of Road Safety Interventions:
The report emphasizes the need for both central and state governments to prioritize road safety interventions.
This includes scaling up efforts to implement road safety measures such as traffic calming, proper signage, and helmet enforcement, especially in rural areas where these measures are often neglected.
Establishment of a National Crash Database:
Creating a national database for road crashes, with public access, is essential for understanding the specific risks faced by different road users and the effectiveness of the interventions implemented by the states.
This would allow for more accurate data collection and enable policymakers to tailor interventions based on real-time information.
Improving Trauma Care Infrastructure:
Strengthening trauma care facilities and ensuring quicker medical responses after accidents is crucial for saving lives.
Investments in healthcare infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, can make a significant difference in reducing fatalities from road accidents.
Conclusion:
India’s road safety challenge is multifaceted and requires urgent attention.
The "India Status Report on Road Safety 2024" calls for a differentiated, state-specific approach to tackling these challenges.
By prioritizing road safety interventions, establishing a national crash database, and improving trauma care, India can make meaningful progress toward reducing road fatalities and ensuring safer roads for all.
