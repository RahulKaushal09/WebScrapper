the coronagraph in the 1930s.
The sun's
corona is normally visible only during solar eclipses
when the moon's shadow covers the bright central layers of our parent star and allows its dimmer corona to appear.
A coronagraph mimics this natural phenomenon with a
circular mask that sits inside a telescope
and selectively blocks the bulk of the sun's light.
The specialized coronagraphs act as
filters on the central star,
allowing the tiny fragments of planetary light to shine through.

**********Key Facts about Vitamin D
Scientists have made some notable discoveries about how Vitamin D deficiency early in life can trigger problems with the body's immune system.
About Vitamin D:
Vitamin D (also referred to as
calciferol
) is a
fat-soluble vitamin
that is
naturally present in a few foods
, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement.
It is also
produced endogenously when ultraviolet (UV) rays
from sunlight
strike the skin
and trigger vitamin D synthesis.
During periods of sunlight
, vitamin D is
stored in fat
and then released
when sunlight is not available.
Foods that naturally have vitamin D include
egg yolks, saltwater fish, and liver.
Why is vitamin D so important?
Vitamin D promotes
calcium absorption
and helps maintain adequate levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood, which is necessary for healthy bones and teeth.
Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen.
Vitamin D also plays a
role in your nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and immune system.
Vitamin D Deficiency:
A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone
diseases such as osteoporosis or rickets
. Osteoporosis is a disease in which your bones become weak and are likely to fracture (break).
With chronic and/or
severe vitamin D deficiency
, a decline in calcium and phosphorus absorption by your intestines
leads to hypocalcemia
low calcium levels
in your blood).
This leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands attempting to keep blood calcium levels normal).
Both hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism
, if severe, can cause symptoms, including muscle weakness and cramps, fatigue, and depression.

**********IL-35 Protein
Scientists at the Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST) in Guwahati, an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology, have discovered a specific protein IL-35 that can aid in new treatments for type I and autoimmune diabetes mellitus.
About
IL-35 Protein:
It is a specific protein of
IL-12α and IL-27β chains
It helps
protect against type 1
autoimmune diabetes.
It regulates macrophage activation, T-cell proteins and regulatory B cells.
It inhibited pancreatic beta cell-attacking immune cells. Additionally, IL-35 lowered particular immune cells that produce inflammatory chemicals,
reducing pancreatic cell infiltration
, a key contributor in type 1 diabetes and autoimmune diabetes mellitus.
What is autoimmune diabetes mellitus?
Autoimmune diabetes mellitus or T1DM is an
organ-specific autoimmune disease
It affects the
insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells
after an inflammatory process, leading to a chronic deficiency of insulin in genetically susceptible individuals.
It ultimately results in lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin.
complex multifactorial disease
in which both genetic susceptibility and
environmental factors promote
the autoimmune responses against beta cells.
Several environmental risk factors have been suggested as candidate triggers of islet autoimmunity, including certain viruses higher birthweight, infant weight gain, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and various dietary factors (e.g., vitamin D deficiency, omega-3 fatty acid deficiency, high milk consumption)

**********Proba-3 Mission
Recently, the Union Minister of Science and Technology said that India will launch the European Space Agency's Proba-3 mission early next month from the spaceport at Sriharikota.
About
Proba-3 Mission:
It is the
(ESA) first mission dedicated to
precision formation flying.
It is an innovative mission which will
demonstrate precision formation flying
between two satellites to create an artificial eclipse, revealing new views of the Sun’s faint corona.
The core objective of the mission is to
create an artificial eclipse
by precisely coordinating two independent satellites. This capability will enable scientists to observe the Sun's corona, a region typically obscured by the intense brightness of the Sun.
It consists of two small satellites — a
Coronagraph spacecraft
and a
solar-disc-shaped Occulter spacecraft.
Working
By flying in tight
formation about 150 metres apart
, the Occulter will precisely cast its shadow onto the Coronagraph’s telescope, blocking the Sun’s direct light.
This will allow the
Coronagraph to image
faint solar corona in visible, ultraviolet and polarised light
for many hours at a time.
It will provide new insights into
the origins of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) — eruptions of solar material that can disrupt satellites and power grids on Earth.

**********Gravity Energy Storage
Gravity energy storage is emerging as a viable solution to address a major challenge of solar and wind power.
About
Gravity Energy Storage:
It is a new technology that
stores energy using gravity.
How it works?
It involves lifting a heavy mass during
excess energy generation
and releasing it to produce electricity when demand rises or solar energy is unavailable.
The types of weights used are often water, concrete blocks or compressed earth blocks.
Unlike pumped-hydro energy storage, gravity energy storage offers more flexibility in site selection.
A typical setup involves a heavy piston within a
fluid-filled cylindrical container.
When solar energy production exceeds demand, surplus electricity lifts the piston, converting the surplus electrical energy into stored energy.
When demand surpasses supply, the piston descends, driving water through a turbine to generate electricity supply to meet demand.
Advantages
It can
last for decades with minimal maintenance
, unlike batteries that degrade over time.
It avoids
harmful chemical reactions,
reducing environmental impact and disposal issues, an important consideration in the move towards a greener planet.
It can also be
more cost-effective for large-scale applications
, with lower level costs of energy and storage.
It is particularly advantageous in areas with space constraints or environmental concerns that restrict the deployment of other storage systems.

**********How Dedicated Freight Corridors are adding to GDP, boosting Rail revenues
Why in news?
A recent study by the University of New South Wales highlights the economic impact of India’s Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) on the country's GDP and Indian Railways’ revenue.
The study found that
reduced freight costs and shorter travel times on DFCs have lowered commodity prices by up to 0.5%. Additionally, DFCs contributed to a 2.94% revenue increase for Indian Railways from FY 2018–19 to FY 2022–23
The analysis focused on the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC) for FY 2019–20, using a Computable General Equilibrium model developed by the central government.
What’s in today’s article?
About
DFCs are specialized freight routes that boost transport capacity through faster transit, double-stack container trains, and heavy-haul trains, enhancing supply chains for industries along economic centers and increasing export-import traffic.
The Ministry of Railways launched the DFC project in 2006, constructing two main corridors:
Eastern DFC (EDFC)
: Spanning 1,337 km from Sonnagar, Bihar, to Sahnewal, Punjab. This corridor is complete and operational, with feeder routes to coal mines and thermal plants.
Western DFC (WDFC)
: Extending 1,506 km from Mumbai’s Jawaharlal Nehru Port to Dadri, UP. Currently 93% operational, it serves major ports in Gujarat and is set for full completion by December 2025.
As of March 31, 2024, Rs 94,091 crore has been invested in the DFC project (excluding land costs).
Need
The need for Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) arose due to two main reasons:
Overuse of the Golden Quadrilateral
: This critical rail network, linking Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Howrah, along with its diagonals, makes up only 16% of routes but handles over 52% of passenger and 58% of freight traffic.
Declining Rail Freight Share
: To address the Railways' decreasing share in total freight traffic, the National Rail Plan set a goal to increase rail freight's share to 45% by 2030.
The DFC project was first announced in the Railway Budget for FY 2005-06. In 2006, then PM Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stones for the Eastern DFC in Ludhiana and the Western DFC in Mumbai.
In October 2006, Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) was established as a Special Purpose Vehicle for the corridors' construction, operation, and maintenance.
In March 2024, PM Modi inaugurated three new DFC sections: the 135-km Makarpura-Sachin segment on the WDFC, and the 179-km Sahnewal-Pilkhani and 222-km Pilkhani-Khurja sections on the EDFC.
Current Status and Future Expansion of India’s Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs)
As of now, approximately 325 freight trains operate daily on India’s DFCs, reflecting a 60% increase compared to the previous year.
These trains are faster, heavier, and safer. Since the inception of the DFCs, they have transported over 232 billion Gross Tonne Kilometres (GTKMs) and 122 billion Net Ton Kilometres (NTKMs) of payload.
Currently, DFCs handle more than 10% of Indian Railways’ freight traffic.
In addition to the existing DFCs, four more corridors are proposed:
East Coast Corridor
: Kharagpur to Vijayawada (1,115 km)
East-West Sub-Corridor-I
: Palghar to Dankuni (2,073 km)
East-West Sub-Corridor-II
: Rajkharsawan to Andal (195 km)
North-South Sub-Corridor
: Vijayawada to Itarsi (975 km)

**********UP Madarsa Education Act upheld by SC
Why in news?
The Supreme Court, in a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, upheld the Constitutional validity of the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004. This Act regulates madarsa education in Uttar Pradesh.
Previously, in March, the Allahabad High Court struck down the Act, citing a violation of secularism principles. However, the Supreme Court stayed this High Court ruling in April, allowing the Act to remain effective until the Supreme Court's final decision.
The recent verdict affirms the law’s legitimacy, emphasizing its compliance with Constitutional standards.
What’s in today’s article?
2004 UP Madarsa Act
Background of the case
Final verdict by the SC
Key highlights of the judgement
Impact of the Supreme Court Decision on the Madarsa Act
Background and Purpose of the Madarsa Act
The Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004, establishes a legal framework for madarsa education in Uttar Pradesh.
This Act enables madarsas to teach
both the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) curriculum and religious studies
Madarsa Board
It also set up the
, primarily comprising members from the Muslim community, to oversee and standardize madarsa education.
Roles and Functions of the Madarsa Board
Under Section 9 of the Act, the Board’s responsibilities include designing course material and conducting exams.
It provides standardized examinations for courses ranging from ‘Maulvi’ (equivalent to Class 10) to ‘Fazil’ (equivalent to a Master's degree).
Background of the present case
Legal Challenge to the Act
A lawyer filed a petition against the Madarsa Act, arguing that it violated several constitutional provisions:
Article 14
: Right to equality before the law
Article 15
: Prohibition of discrimination on religious grounds
Article 21-A
: Right to free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14
The petitioner claimed that the Act did not provide quality compulsory education up to Class 8 or universal access to quality education, as mandated by Article 21-A.
Matter reaches Allahabad HC
Key Issues Raised Before the Allahabad High Court
Secularism and the Madarsa Act
: Whether the provisions of the Madarsa Act align with secularism.
Religious Exclusivity in Board Membership
: The Act’s requirement for Board members to belong to a specific religion was questioned, with arguments for allowing members from diverse backgrounds with expertise in education, regardless of religion.
Administration Under the Minority Welfare Department
: Whether it was arbitrary to place the Board under the Minority Welfare Department instead of the Education Ministry.
Access to Educational Expertise and Policies
: Whether it was unfair to deny madarsa students access to educational experts and their policies, which could enhance the quality of education provided in madarsas.
Key highlights of the Judgement by Allahabad HC
Allahabad High Court declared Madarsa Act to be unconstitutional.
It directed the State to take steps forthwith for accommodating the Madarsa students in regular schools recognized under various education Boards.
Matter reached to SC
In April 2024, the Supreme Court stayed the Allahabad High Court's judgment, noting that while the state has a valid interest in ensuring quality education for students, the High Court erred in striking down the Madarsa Act.
The Apex Court observed that the Act was primarily regulatory and did not warrant complete invalidation.
Final Verdict by the SC
Arguments before SC
Religious Education vs. Religious Instruction
The Court explored whether madarsas impart “religious education” (learning about religions) or “religious instruction” (compulsory participation in worship).
Referring to
Aruna Roy vs Union of India (2002)
, the Court highlighted that while religious instruction is restricted in state-recognized institutions under Article 28, religious education aimed at promoting communal harmony is permissible.
Validity of Striking Down the Entire Act
The Court questioned whether the High Court was justified in invalidating the entire Madarsa Act, rather than targeting specific provisions.
CJI noted that discarding the entire Act would be extreme, suggesting that the state could enforce rules under the Act to promote a more secular curriculum.
Final verdict by SC
SC upheld the constitutional validity of the 'Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act 2004'.
It set aside the Allahabad High Court's judgement which had struck it down earlier.
Regulation of Education Standards
The Madarsa Act provides a regulatory framework to ensure educational standards in madarsas recognized by the Board.
Alignment with State Obligations
The Act aligns with the state’s obligation to enable students in recognized madarsas to acquire skills and competencies necessary for social participation and employment.
Balance with Minority Rights
The Act must be interpreted alongside Article 21A and the Right to Education Act, respecting religious and linguistic minorities' rights to manage their educational institutions.
With state approval, the Board may implement regulations that ensure secular education standards without compromising the institutions' minority character.
Legislative Competence and Limits
While the Madarsa Act falls within the State Legislature’s jurisdiction under Entry 25 of List 3, provisions regulating higher degrees (e.g., fazil and kamil) are unconstitutional as they conflict with the UGC Act, which is governed by Entry 66 of List 1.
The Supreme Court's decision will directly impact madarsa education in Uttar Pradesh, with broader implications for religious education nationwide.
This ruling could influence other religious institutions, such as gurukuls and convent schools, by shaping how secularism principles apply to religious education within state-regulated educational frameworks.

**********Supreme Court Sets Boundaries on State Acquisition of Private Resources for Public Benefit
Why in News?
The Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling, established limits on the government’s power to take over privately owned resources for public distribution.
This ruling, passed by an
8-1 majority
of a nine-judge Constitution bench,
clarified the scope of Article 39(b) of the Indian Constitution
, which concerns the State’s responsibility to manage resources for the common good.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Constitutional Provisions Touched Upon by the SC in its Judgement Limiting State Acquisition of Private Resources
Key Points of the SC Ruling Limiting State Acquisition of Private Resources
The SC on Constitutional Safeguards for Privately Owned Resources
Dissenting Views and Historical Context of Limiting State Acquisition of Private Resources
Broader Implications of the SC Ruling Limiting State Acquisition of Private Resources
Constitutional Provisions Touched Upon by the SC in its Judgement Limiting State Acquisition of Private Resources:
Article 14:
Guarantees the
right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws
to all individuals within India. It prevents discrimination and ensures fairness in laws.
Article 19:
Provides citizens with
certain fundamental freedoms
, including the freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession.
These rights, however, are subject to reasonable restrictions for the sake of public order, morality, and national interest.
Article 31C:
Protects laws aimed at implementing Article 39(b) and 39(c) from being challenged on the grounds of violating the rights under Articles 14 and 19.
This “safe harbour” provision shields such laws if they promote public welfare by ensuring
equitable distribution of resources
Article 39(b):
Directs the State to manage the distribution of material resources of the community in a way that best serves the common good.
It guides policies that aim to
reduce inequality and ensure resources benefit everyone.
Article 39(c):
Aims to prevent the concentration of wealth and means of production in a way that harms common welfare.
It encourages policies that reduce economic disparity and promotes fair distribution of wealth.
Key Points of the SC Ruling Limiting State Acquisition of Private Resources:
Defining "Material Resources of the Community":
The Court clarified that
only certain private resources
, meeting specific criteria, qualify as “material resources of the community” under Article 39(b) and can thus be subject to state acquisition.
Each case would depend on the resource’s nature
, scarcity, community impact, and whether public or private control serves community welfare better.
Balancing public welfare and private property rights:
The Chief Justice of India (CJI), writing for the majority, stated that
while public welfare is essential, it must be balanced against the rights of private property owners
The court overruled previous expansive interpretations, underscoring India’s commitment to
“economic democracy”
that avoids strictly socialist or capitalist models, instead advocating a balanced approach that respects both public and private interests.
Criteria for state acquisition:
The majority ruling outlined
two criteria for a resource to be considered a “material resource of the community”
It must be both significant (“material”) and
Hold a “community” element.
Examples
given included resources that are scarce or essential for the community’s well-being, which may more easily justify state intervention.
The SC on Constitutional Safeguards for Privately Owned Resources:
The ruling emphasised that
Article 39(b) must be read in conjunction with Article 300A
, which protects property rights under the Constitution.
warned against using Article 39(b) as a blanket licence
for acquiring private property, highlighting the
need to respect property rights
Article 31C and immunity for public welfare laws:
The Court reiterated that
Article 31C provides immunity to laws enacted for the common good
as per Article 39(b) and (c).
However, this immunity
applies only if such laws genuinely further public welfare objectives
, ensuring that legislative actions aligning with these constitutional goals are protected from challenges under -
Article 14 and
Article 19.
Dissenting Views and Historical Context of Limiting State Acquisition of Private Resources:
Historical context:
In 1977
, Justice
VR Krishna Iyer
interpreted that all private property could potentially qualify for redistribution as a community resource.
This approach was followed by the SC in the
1982 Sanjeev Coke case
, which had broadly interpreted state power over private resources.
The recent ruling, while rejecting this approach,
overturned the 1982 Sanjeev Coke case
and advocated a more balanced interpretation.
Dissenting views:
Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia’s dissent:
He
wrote the only dissenting judgement
, disagreeing with defining what qualifies as “material resources,” suggesting this responsibility should fall to the legislature rather than the Court.
Justice Nagarathna’s perspective:
She argued that past interpretations, especially those by Justice Iyer, should not be disregarded, as they reflected historical priorities toward public welfare post-Independence.
Broader Implications of the SC Ruling Limiting State Acquisition of Private Resources:
The recent ruling stemmed from a dispute involving
MHADA
(Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority), which acquired buildings for redevelopment.
Property owners challenged this acquisition, citing
This ruling marks a significant development in interpreting the
, limiting the State’s power to acquire private resources for public welfare.
By balancing public interest with private property rights, the Court has reinforced a framework that
respects both individual and collective interests
, establishing
constitutional clarity
for future cases.
The Court’s decision impacts similar cases
, requiring that each state acquisition of private resources align with Article 39(b) and ensure a genuine community benefit.

Why in the News?
On Tuesday, November 5, a 9-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that the government cannot acquire and redistribute all privately owned properties by labeling them as
“material resources of the community”
under Article 39(b) of the Constitution.
What criteria should be used to determine if a privately owned resource qualifies as a ‘material resource of the community’?
Purpose and Public Utility
: Privately owned resources may be classified as
if they are essential for societal welfare, addressing collective needs, or fulfilling significant public purposes, such as energy, water, or land critical for infrastructure.
Proportionality and Fairness
: The court emphasized that any state action must be proportional, balancing public benefit with the impact on private owners.
Economic Impact and Control
: Resources that have a substantial impact on the
national economy
or are crucial for maintaining societal equity (such as natural resources) may be considered community resources, but this does not apply to general private property.
How does this ruling impact the balance between individual property rights and the state’s ability to intervene for public welfare?
This ruling reinforces individual property rights, clarifying that
private property cannot be arbitrarily acquired
under the guise of benefiting society. The state must justify the acquisition based on substantial, verifiable public welfare needs.
Limitations on State Power
: By rejecting an expansive interpretation of
Article 39(b),
the court limits state power, ensuring that only properties directly tied to public interest and welfare fall under this category.
What are the potential economic implications of this ruling in India?
Investment Climate
: This ruling strengthens protections for private property, likely improving investor confidence by assuring that property rights are safeguarded from excessive state intervention.
Economic Development and Social Equity
: By narrowing the scope of Article 39(b), the ruling limits redistributive policies to sectors where public welfare is a clear priority, allowing economic resources to be distributed in a manner that considers social equity while respecting individual rights.
Real Estate and Industrial Sectors
: The ruling could positively affect sectors with high-value assets, such as real estate and industry, as businesses will have greater certainty regarding property ownership and security.
How might this decision influence future legal interpretations and legislative actions?
Refined Scope for Article 39(b) Applications
: Future legislation under Article 39(b) must specifically justify how resources qualify as “material resources of the community,” likely limiting nationalization or acquisition to specific, strategically important sectors.
Increased Judicial Scrutiny on Property Rights
: Courts are likely to more critically evaluate state actions that aim to redistribute private property, requiring robust evidence of public interest and alignment with constitutional principles.
Potential for Policy Revisions
: Laws that invoke Article 39(b) and related provisions may need to be reviewed to ensure they comply with this interpretation, leading to a more nuanced application of public welfare policies.
Way forward:
Establish Clear Guidelines for Public Interest Acquisition
: The government should define transparent criteria for categorizing “material resources of the community,” ensuring acquisitions serve substantial public welfare needs and align with societal priorities, especially in areas like infrastructure and essential services.
Strengthen Judicial and Legislative Safeguards
: Introduce legal safeguards to protect individual property rights, allowing courts to rigorously assess state actions on property acquisition, ensuring proportionality, fairness, and adherence to constitutional principles.

**********A law that enables vigilante violence
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to vigilantism;
Why in the News?
On July 30, Uttar Pradesh toughened its 2021 anti-conversion law, increasing the maximum sentence to life imprisonment, tightening bail conditions, and expanding “illegal conversion” to include promises of marriage and trafficking.
How do current laws facilitate vigilante actions under the guise of protecting societal values?
Expansion of Complainant Scope
: The amended law allows any individual, regardless of personal involvement or direct impact, to lodge complaints about alleged unlawful conversions.
Broad Interpretation of “Public Interest”
: By permitting police officers and unrelated third parties to file FIRs, the law can be exploited to initiate cases that target religious minorities or interfaith couples, framing these as societal threats.
Legal Ambiguity and Arbitrary Application
: The inconsistent interpretations of
“aggrieved person”
Section 4
by different courts have led to uncertainty.
This ambiguity has allowed authorities and vigilantes to target groups and individuals selectively, often with little or no evidence of wrongdoing, undermining personal freedoms and due process.
Reduced Threshold for Evidence
: By widening the scope of what constitutes “illegal conversion” to include vague terms like
“promise of marriage,”
the law can easily be manipulated.
This opens the door for complaints based on assumptions or suspicions, rather than clear, proven instances of forced conversion.
What measures can be implemented to ensure effective enforcement of laws against mob violence and vigilantism?
Strict Definitions and Limits on Complainants
: Restricting who can file complaints to genuinely aggrieved parties—directly affected individuals or close relatives—could help prevent misuse by third-party vigilante actors.
Accountability Mechanisms for Law Enforcement
: Police officers who file unfounded FIRs based on ideologically motivated complaints should face accountability measures.
Disciplinary action or judicial oversight in cases of misuse would help discourage officers from acting on non-substantial complaints.
Enhanced Legal Protections for Victims of Vigilantism
: Establishing a separate body to investigate and prosecute cases of mob violence and vigilante actions can protect targeted groups.
Promotion of Public Awareness and Legal Literacy
: Initiatives to raise awareness about individual rights and legal processes can empower citizens to resist unlawful actions by vigilantes.
What role do societal perception and political influence play in the rise of vigilantism?
Ideological Justifications for Vigilantism
: Laws like the anti-conversion amendment are often framed as measures to protect cultural or religious values, creating a narrative that justifies vigilante actions as morally and socially acceptable.
Political Endorsement and Implicit Encouragement
: When political entities endorse such laws or publicly support vigilante actions, they create a permissive environment for vigilantism.
Media Influence and Public Perception
: Coverage of interfaith relationships or religious conversions as “threats” to societal harmony often fuels public support for vigilante actions.
Sensationalist media narratives contribute to a heightened perception of certain groups as “others,” justifying vigilantism as a form of social correction.
Inadequate Legal Deterrence
: Weak penalties for mob violence or leniency in prosecuting vigilantes reinforce the perception that vigilantism will be tolerated, especially if aligned with popular or politically endorsed views.
Way forward:
Enact Clearer Legal Boundaries and Protections:
Define strict limits on who can file complaints under anti-conversion laws, ensuring only directly affected individuals or close family members can do so.
Strengthen Public Awareness and Judicial Oversight:
Promote legal literacy campaigns to educate citizens on their rights and the dangers of vigilante actions, and establish judicial oversight for cases involving mob violence and vigilantism to ensure accountability and protection for targeted groups.
Mains PYQ:
Mob violence is emerging as a serious law and order problem in India. By giving suitable examples, analyze the causes and consequences of such violence.

**********Aadhaar biometric data access will aid forensics
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Significance of Aadhaar biometric data;
Why in the News?
The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) enforces strict regulations on data disclosure to safeguard individuals’ privacy and prevent misuse of personal information. Under normal circumstances, the police cannot access the demographic or biometric details stored in the Aadhaar database.
What are the legal limitations of using Aadhaar biometric data for forensic purposes?
Stringent Privacy Protections
: The Aadhaar Act mandates strict protection of personal data, especially biometrics.
Sections 29(1) and 33(1)
prevent sharing of core biometric data (fingerprints and iris scans) with third parties, even law enforcement, barring limited situations.
Court Order Requirement
Section 33(1)
allows disclosure of certain demographic data upon the order of a High Court or above, but core biometrics are strictly protected and cannot be shared, creating limitations for police investigations involving unidentified bodies.
Forensic Investigative Gaps
: Police databases are often limited to individuals with criminal records, restricting the ability to identify deceased persons through fingerprints.
Without access to a comprehensive Aadhaar database, identification processes for unknown deceased individuals become more challenging and time-consuming.
How can the balance between privacy rights and forensic needs be achieved?
Right to Privacy vs. Right to Dignity
: Balancing the fundamental right to privacy with the right to a dignified life and death is essential, especially in cases where access to biometric data can help identify unknown bodies.
Controlled Access Mechanisms
: Limited, case-specific access, such as requiring a judicial magistrate’s order
(rather than a High Court order)
, can allow law enforcement to use Aadhaar biometrics in cases involving unidentified bodies, reducing the burden on higher courts while preserving privacy safeguards.
Transparent Oversight
: Any mechanism permitting Aadhaar data usage for forensics should include robust oversight, including logging access and stringent penalties for misuse, ensuring that access is restricted to genuinely necessary cases.
What technological and procedural changes are necessary to facilitate the use of Aadhaar data in forensics?
Advanced Identification Algorithms
: Introducing algorithms similar to the U.S.
Deceased Persons Identification (DPI) system
would enable more accurate and efficient matching of deceased persons’ fingerprints with larger databases.
Digitization of Police Records
: Digitizing state-level fingerprint databases would allow faster cross-referencing and aid forensic investigations, creating a more accessible identification system even without Aadhaar.
Secure Data Access Channels
: Secure and encrypted channels specifically for forensic use, with limited access, could protect the data while allowing controlled use.
Specific Legislative Frameworks
: There should be new amendments that could clarify circumstances under which biometric data can be accessed for deceased individuals, distinguishing these cases from broader data privacy concerns.
Way forward:
Amend Legal Framework for Controlled Access
: Need to introduce specific legislative amendments allowing limited, case-specific access to Aadhaar biometrics for forensic purposes in cases involving unidentified deceased individuals, with strict judicial oversight to maintain privacy protections.
Establish Secure Access Protocols and Oversight
: Need to implement secure, encrypted access channels and enforce strict oversight mechanisms, including access logging and penalties for misuse, ensuring biometric data is accessed only when absolutely necessary for forensic identification.
Mains PYQ:
Two parallel run schemes of the Government, viz the Adhar card and NPM, one of voluntary and the other as compulsory, have led to debates at national levels and also litigations.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Sun’s Rotation
Why in the News?
Indian astronomers at the
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KSO)
have achieved a groundbreaking feat by mapping, for the first time, the variation in the Sun’s rotation speed from its equator to its poles.
Sun’s Rotation: Key Facts
Unlike a solid body, the Sun exhibits
differential rotation
, meaning different parts of the Sun rotate at different speeds.
The
varies depending on latitude, with
faster rotation near the equator
and slower rotation toward the poles.
This variation is primarily
due to the Sun’s composition
of gaseous plasma rather than solid material.
Rotation Period Variation by Latitude
Equatorial Regions
: The rotation period at the equator is the fastest, around
24.47 days
(sidereal rotation).
Sunspot Zones (about 16 degrees latitude)
: Rotation slows slightly, with a period of about
27.3 days
Higher Latitudes (up to 75 degrees)
: Rotation slows significantly; for example, at
75 degrees latitude
, the rotation period is about
33.4 days
Poles
: The slowest rotation occurs at the poles, with a period around
31.1 days
Sidereal vs. Synodic Rotation Periods
Sidereal Rotation Period
: The time taken for the Sun to complete one full rotation relative to distant stars. It varies by latitude, from
24.47 days at the equator
to around
33.4 days at higher latitudes
: This is the time for a fixed feature on the Sun to appear in the same position when observed from Earth. It is longer than the sidereal period due to Earth’s own movement around the Sun, averaging around
26.24 days
Why Differential Rotation Occur?
Gaseous Plasma Composition
: The Sun is composed of plasma—a hot, ionized state of matter—which allows its different regions to rotate at different speeds.
Convective Zone Dynamics
: The outer convective layer of the Sun contributes to differential rotation. Plasma circulates, rising and sinking, which influences the rotational speed at different latitudes.
Scientific Implications
Solar Dynamo Theory
: The differential rotation of the Sun is central to theories about the
solar dynamo
—the process that generates the Sun’s magnetic field.
Mystery of Differential Rotation
: Despite extensive research, the exact mechanism behind the Sun’s differential rotation remains an active area of investigation in
solar physics
