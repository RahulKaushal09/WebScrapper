NINE YEARS OF PARIS AGREEMENT
Syllabus:
Mains – GS 2 & GS 3
Context:
The Paris Agreement was supposed to save the world from the worst impacts of climate change. But nine years after it was finalised — on December 12, 2015 — it is perhaps more fragile than ever, appearing increasingly ineffective and helpless  in containing worsening climate situation.
Background: –
The main goal of the Paris Agreement — holding global annual average temperatures within 1.5 degree Celsius of pre-industrial averages, two degrees Celsius in the worst case scenario — seems more distant than ever.
Key takeaways
In the nine years, annual global emissions have grown 8% from about 49 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent to 53 billion tonnes. Average annual global temperatures have increased from 1.1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial average to 1.45 degree Celsius above that level.
Erosion of Trust Among Developing Nations
Unmet Financial Obligations:
Developed countries failed to meet the $100 billion annual climate finance goal by 2020.
A finance deal in Baku only proposed increasing this to $300 billion by 2035, which is grossly inadequate given the trillions needed annually by developing nations.
Equity Concerns:
The Paris Agreement replaced the Kyoto Protocol, which held developed countries primarily accountable for emissions reductions.
The Kyoto Protocol had assigned specific emissions reduction targets on developed countries, but placed virtually no responsibilities on the rest of the world. The Paris Agreement mandated everyone to take climate actions, but only in a “nationally-determined” manner, essentially freeing developed countries of their assigned responsibilities.
Geopolitical Dimensions
Role of Developed Nations:
Developed nations have consistently resisted stringent climate obligations, fearing economic repercussions.
The United States’ potential withdrawal under Donald Trump’s presidency could further weaken global climate action.
Emerging Economies: The growing economic power of countries like China has shifted the climate narrative, with developed nations demanding greater contributions from such nations while ignoring their historical emissions.
Alternative Strategies by Developing Nations
Vanuatu’s Initiative: The resolution passed by the UN General Assembly to seek the ICJ’s advice on defining countries’ climate obligations is a significant step by vulnerable nations.
Small island nations aim to establish clearer legal consequences for failing to meet climate commitments.

SOCIAL DIALOGUE REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION (ILO)
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
The Social Dialogue Report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), released recently, has recommended the governments to uphold fundamental principles and rights at work, especially freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.
Report found that countries’ compliance with freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining had deteriorated by 7% between 2015 and 2022.
What is Social Dialogue?
Definition: Social dialogue refers to discussions, consultations, negotiations, and other interactions between governments, employers, and workers on issues related to economic and social policy.
Purpose: To promote consensus-building, resolve workplace conflicts, and ensure equitable economic and social development.
The International Labour Organisation (ILO), a United Nations agency, champions social dialogue as one of its four strategic objectives under the Decent Work Agenda.
The Social Dialogue Report provides a global perspective on:
The effectiveness of social dialogue in different countries.
The role of tripartite structures (governments, employers, and workers) in promoting decent work.
Best practices and challenges in achieving workplace harmony.
Highlights of the Latest Social Dialogue Report:
The report has highlighted the experience of Rajasthan that brought in the Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Bill to provide for the establishment of the Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers Welfare Board.
The report argues that social dialogue can enable countries to pursue economic development alongside social progress, while ensuring fair and inclusive low-carbon and digital transitions.
The ILO has also recommended the national social dialogue institutions (NSDIs) of various countries to expand their outreach to under-represented groups.

PORT OF LATAKIA
Prelims – GEOGRAPHY
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has attacked Syria’s naval fleet at the ports of Al-Bayda and Latakia.
Attacks are part of Israel’s effort to neutralise military assets in the country after the fall of the Assad regime.

JAL JEEVAN MISSION
The Prime Minister recently emphasised that Jal Jeevan Mission was furthering women empowerment, especially in rural areas.
PM Modi pointed out that women, who previously had to travel long distances to fetch clean water, can now access it right at their doorstep. This shift, he said, allows women to focus more on skill development and self-reliance.
Jal Jeevan Mission, is envisioned to provide safe and adequate drinking water through individual household tap connections by 2024 to all households in rural India.
The mission was launched on August 15, 2019.
Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) is a centrally sponsored scheme
As of October 2024, the mission has extended tap water connections to 15.20 crore rural households, covering over 78% of all rural households in India.
Community Approach: The mission emphasizes a community approach to water management, including extensive Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities.
Source Sustainability: Measures such as recharge and reuse through grey water management, water conservation, and rainwater harvesting are mandatory components.
Water Supply: Supply 55 liters of water per person per day (lpcd) in every rural household.
Focus on Quality: Ensure safe and adequate water that meets Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) norms.
Additional Information
A recent report by the State Bank of India highlighted the broader impact of the initiative.
Rural households across India have seen an 8.3 percentage point reduction in the need to fetch water from outside their premises. This has led to a 7.4 percentage point rise in women’s participation in agriculture and other productive activities.
The report also noted significant progress in states like Bihar and Assam, where female workforce participation has surged by over 28 percentage points.
WHO projects that ensuring safely managed drinking water for all households in India could prevent nearly 400,000 deaths from diarrheal diseases, saving approximately 14 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).
The Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO), estimates that JJM will generate 59.9 lakh person-years of direct and 2.2 crore person-years of indirect employment during its capital expenditure phase. Additionally, the operation and maintenance phase could generate 13.3 lakh person-years of direct employment.

**********Manganese
Recently, a team of scientists has claimed that Manganese (Mn) contamination of water is causing cancer in the Gangetic plains of Bihar.
About Manganese:
Manganese is the fifth-most abundant metal on earth that exists in the form of oxides, carbonates and silicates.
It is present in water, soil and rock as a naturally occurring component.
Properties
It is too brittle to be of much use as a pure metal. It is mainly used in alloys, such as steel.
Its minerals are widely distributed, with pyrolusite (manganese dioxide) and rhodochrosite (manganese carbonate) being the most common.
It somewhat resembles iron in general chemical activity.
It oxidizes superficially in air and rusts in moist air.
It is obtained by reducing the oxide with sodium, magnesium or aluminium, or by the electrolysis of manganese sulfate.
Its ores are primarily found in Australia, South Africa, China, Gabon and Brazil.
It is essential for the growth of plants and is also involved in the assimilation of nitrates in plants and algae.
Biological role:
It is an ‘essential trace element’ which plays a vital role in maintaining body homeostasis but can cause severe toxicity if consumed in excess.
It is an essential element in all known living organisms. Many types of enzymes contain manganese.

**********One Nation One Election Proposal Is Not Representative, It Is Insincere
Context
On December 12, the Union Cabinet approved a proposal to implement simultaneous elections
across India, encompassing the Lok Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, and local bodies.
This
decision stems from the recommendations of a high-level committee chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind,
which submitted its
report on the One Nation, One Election plan in September 2024.
While the idea of simultaneous elections has been
championed for its potential benefits, such as cost reduction and administrative efficiency, it has ignited significant debate
over its feasibility and implications for India's democratic framework.
The Genesis and Scope of the Proposal
Historical Context of Simultaneous Elections
The idea of simultaneous elections, often referred to as
One Nation, One Election, has been periodically debated in India’s political discourse.
Its
origins can be traced back to the early years of the Republic
when elections to
the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies were held simultaneously until 1967.
practice was disrupted due to early dissolutions of certain assemblies
and the Lok Sabha itself, resulting in a staggered election schedule that persists today.
present proposal to revive simultaneous elections gained renewed momentum after Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocated for it in 2013
, citing the high costs, administrative burden, and policy disruptions caused by frequent elections.
Mandate and Scope of the Kovind Committee
The high-level committee
was tasked with examining the feasibility of implementing this concept.
Constituted on September 2, 2023, the committee dedicated 191 days to prepare a comprehensive 18,626-page report
, which it submitted on March 14, 2024.
Unlike previous committees,
this one was not asked to weigh the pros and cons of simultaneous elections but was specifically directed to suggest legislative and administrative measures
to implement the concept.
limitation in scope has been a significant point of contention among critics
, who argue that a holistic analysis of the proposal’s broader implications was necessary before moving toward implementation.
Concerns, Criticism and Challenges Surrounding the ONOE Proposal
Public Consultations and their Limitations
The report invited public feedback,
receiving over 21,000 responses, with 80% reportedly supporting the proposal.
However,
the methodology of soliciting suggestions, restricted to Hindi and English, has drawn criticism
for potentially excluding a significant portion of India's multilingual and diverse population.
Consequently, the responses may not adequately represent the views of all regions or communities
, particularly those where regional parties dominate the political landscape.
Political Divisions over the Proposal
Among the 47 political parties
that responded to the committee,
a stark divide emerged.
Thirty-two parties, all aligned with the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), endorsed the proposal,
emphasising its potential to streamline governance and reduce election-related expenditures.
On the other hand,
15 opposition parties vehemently opposed it
, deeming the proposal anti-democratic and a threat to federalism.
Critics argued that simultaneous elections could centralise power, marginalise regional parties, and shift India’s parliamentary system toward a quasi-presidential model
, where national narratives overshadow local and state-specific issues.
Phased Implementation and Constitutional Amendments
The scope of the proposal extends beyond merely aligning election dates.
It envisions the synchronisation of Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections,
while local body elections are to follow within 100 days of general elections.
phased approach, while attempting to address logistical complexities, raises questions about its alignment
with the very definition of simultaneous elections.
report also outlined constitutional amendments, including the introduction of a new Article 82A
mandates that all legislative assemblies elected after a specific date complete their full terms alongside the Lok Sabha.
Dilution of Local and State Level Issues
A primary concern is that simultaneous elections
could dilute the focus on local and state-specific issues.
National narratives might overshadow regional matters
, undermining the federal structure of governance.
States could lose the flexibility to dissolve assemblies based on political needs
, potentially affecting the outcomes of state elections.
report's proposal to align state elections with the Lok Sabha's tenure in case of early dissolutions raises questions
about the practicality and fairness of truncated terms for elected representatives.
Logistical Challenges
The proposal requires conducting municipal and panchayat elections within 100 days of general elections, effectively demanding two separate election phases.
Mobilising 15 million election staff twice in such a short span
, while ensuring voter participation,
could prove impossible.
Wage workers and employees might face difficulties in returning to polling stations,
potentially disenfranchising millions.
Furthermore,
the financial burden of acquiring and maintaining three times the current number of electronic voting machines (EVMs)
and voter-verifiable paper audit trails (VVPATs)
contradicts the purported goal of cost reduction.
Some Other Criticisms of ONOE Proposal
Little Contemplation on Alternative Approaches
report did not explore alternative methods
to address election-related costs and disruptions.
Reducing the duration of elections from 10 weeks to four weeks
, coupled with a cap on political party expenditures,
could significantly lower costs without overhauling the electoral framework.
These measures, however, were beyond the committee’s mandate
, raising questions about the narrow scope of its recommendations.
Questions on the Sincerity of the Proposal
The credibility of the simultaneous election proposal has been
undermined by its inconsistent implementation over the years.
For instance,
Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat elections, traditionally held simultaneously, were separated in recent years.
Similarly,
elections due within six months have not been clubbed, contradicting the proposal's stated rationale.
Critics argue that these inconsistencies reveal a lack of genuine commitment to the idea and suggest a political motive behind its sudden resurgence.
Constitutional and Legislative Implications
Implementing simultaneous elections
would necessitate significant constitutional amendments and legislative changes.
A proposed Article 82A seeks to standardise the tenure of state assemblies
with the Lok Sabha.
the proposal does not eliminate the possibility of midterm elections,
which could undermine the very principle of simultaneity.
Additionally, transitioning to a single electoral roll for all three tiers of elections
, as recommended,
would place an onerous responsibility on the Election Commission of India (ECI).
It will
require seamless coordination with state election commissions which is a challenging task,
especially in opposition-ruled states.
Conclusion
concept of simultaneous elections has the potential to streamline India’s electoral processes,
reduce costs, and minimise disruptions to governance.
the current proposal is fraught with challenges
, ranging from logistical and financial constraints to constitutional and democratic concerns.
implementation without a broad consensus
risks undermining India’s federal structure
and democratic ethos.
Without genuine consensus
and transparent deliberation,
the One Nation, One Election plan risks becoming an exercise in centralisation rather than a tool for democratic empowerment.

**********Suspension of MFN Clause in India-Switzerland Tax Treaty
Why in News?
Switzerland has announced the suspension of the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) clause under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India, effective January 1, 2025.
This move could lead to higher tax burdens for Indian companies operating in Switzerland and Swiss investors in India, potentially impacting bilateral investments.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Most Favoured Nation (MFN)?
Background of the India-Switzerland Tax Treaty
Implications of the Suspension of the MFN Clause
Conclusion
Meaning:
An MFN clause mandates a country that provides a trade concession to one trading partner
to extend the same treatment to all trading partners.
It is a founding principle of the
World Trade Organisation
(WTO).
For example,
if a WTO member country reduces a tariff on a product for one trading partner, it must also extend that same tariff reduction to all other WTO members.
Purpose:
MFN aims to replace power-based policies with a rules-based framework, where trading rights are not dependent on a country's economic or political clout.
Pros and Cons of MFN:
Exemptions:
The WTO provides the following exemptions from MFN provisions -
When members strike
bilateral trade agreements
or when members offer
developing countries special access
to their markets.
Trade blocs
like the European Union (EU), are allowed to discriminate against imports from outside the bloc.
Trade barriers in response to unfair competition, etc.
WTO members can impose any trade measures they want on
countries that are not members of the WTO
(Iran, North Korea, Syria, Belarus, etc).
Removal of MFN status:
There is
no formal procedure
for suspending MFN treatment and it is unclear whether members must notify the WTO if they do so.
India revoked Pakistan's MFN status following the Pulwama attack in 2019. Pakistan has never granted India MFN status.
Background of the India-Switzerland Tax Treaty:
Original agreement:
The DTAA between India and Switzerland was signed in 1994 and amended in 2010 to prevent double taxation of income.
Supreme Court ruling:
In 2023, the Indian SC ruled that the DTAA’s provisions require explicit notification under the Income-Tax Act to be enforceable.
This overturned a Delhi High Court decision that protected entities from double taxation.
The court ruled that a country can claim DTAA benefits only from the treaty's date of enforcement,
not retroactively
Though companies like Nestlé and Concentrix argued for reduced withholding tax rates under OECD-member treaties,
the ruling rejected automatic applicability.
Reason for suspension of the MFN clause:
The Swiss government cited
a lack of reciprocity
as the basis for suspending the MFN clause.
Swiss authorities stated that
they could not apply reduced tax rates unilaterally without mutual agreement from India.
Implications of the Suspension of the MFN Clause:
Higher tax rates:
Dividends paid after January 1, 2025, will be taxed at
a higher rate of 10%
in the source state.
affects Swiss companies like Nestlé and challenges India's attractiveness as an investment destination.
On European Free Trade Association (EFTA):
Switzerland’s suspension poses risks to the $100 billion investment commitment under the EFTA-India trade pact, signed in March 2024.
is an intergovernmental grouping of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
On bilateral treaty dynamics:
The decision underscores evolving international tax frameworks and India’s stricter treaty interpretations.
Indian entities operating in Switzerland may face higher tax liabilities/ increased financial burdens, reflecting broader global taxation trends.
Conclusion:
Switzerland’s suspension of the MFN clause marks a significant shift in India-Switzerland tax treaty relations.
While aimed at addressing reciprocity concerns, the move could deter Swiss investments in India and complicate tax compliance for Indian entities.
The development emphasises the importance of mutual agreement and clarity in international tax treaties to ensure stability and fairness in cross-border trade and investment.

**********No Indian city meets WHO air quality standards
Why in news?
According to a study recently published in Lancet Planet Health, no one in India lives in areas where the yearly average pollution levels are below the levels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
What’s in today’s article?
WHO’s revised air quality guidelines 2021
India’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
Key highlights of the study
About
In September 2021, WHO updated its air quality guidelines (AQGs) to reflect the serious health impacts of air pollution:
PM2. 5
: The annual mean concentration should not exceed 5 µg/m3. This is half of the 2005 guideline of 10 µg/m3.
NO2
: The annual mean concentration should not exceed 10 µg/m3.
Ozone
: The peak season mean 8-hour concentration should not exceed 60 µg/m3.
PM10
: The annual mean concentration should not exceed 15 µg/m3, and the 24-hour mean should not exceed 45 µg/m3.
SO2
: The 24-hour mean concentration should not exceed 40 µg/m3.
CO
: The 24-hour mean concentration should not exceed 7 µg/m3.
Non-binding in nature
The WHO AQGs are not legally binding, but they are often used by countries and legislative bodies to set air quality policies.
The guidelines are based on scientific evidence from multiple countries and are intended to help reduce the health impacts of air pollution.
Ambient air quality refers to the condition or quality of air surrounding us in the outdoors.
Under the authority of the
Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981
, India’s Central Pollution Control Board sets national ambient air quality standards.
The current Standards include following 12 pollutants:
Widespread Air Pollution in India
No area in India meets the WHO's recommended PM2.5 pollution level of 5 µg/m³.
81.9% of the population lives in areas exceeding India's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 40 µg/m³.
Health Impact of Air Pollution
High levels of PM2.5 are linked to 1.5 million deaths annually in India.
Long-term exposure to air pollution increases risks of respiratory diseases, heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, and developmental delays in children.
Every 10 µg/m³ increase in PM2.5 levels raises the risk of death by 8.6%.
Regional Pollution Levels
Pollution levels ranged from 11.2 µg/m³ in Arunachal Pradesh’s Lower Subansiri district (2019) to 119 µg/m³ in Ghaziabad and Delhi (2016).
Potential for Improvement
Meeting NAAQS could prevent 0.3 million deaths annually; achieving WHO levels would save even more lives.
Identifying and addressing pollution sources, such as construction, vehicular emissions, and crop burning, is critical.

**********Arctic ice melting - First ice-free day in the Arctic could come by 2030
Why in news?
A new study published in Nature Communications suggests the Arctic Ocean could experience its first ice-free day—defined as less than one million square kilometers of sea ice—by 2030 or earlier, driven by unprecedented greenhouse gas emissions.
The analysis warns that while the scenario is unlikely, its plausibility is growing due to continued human-induced climate change.
Arctic sea ice has been shrinking at an alarming rate, with its extent decreasing by 12.6% per decade over the last 40 years—a rate unmatched in at least 1,500 years, according to the MIT Climate Portal's 2023 report.
What’s in today’s article?
Arctic Region
Key highlights of the study
What happens if the Arctic becomes ice-free?
Introduction
The Arctic region, or the Arctic, is a geographic region spreading around the North Pole.
It includes the northern parts of Canada, the United States, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Greenland.
The Arctic Ocean lies between these lands. An imaginary line, called the Arctic Circle, surrounds most of the area.
The Arctic Circle (66° 33'N) defines the Arctic based on solar radiation.
Geography and Climate
The Arctic consists mainly of flat, treeless tundras with some mountainous areas.
Much of the ground is permanently frozen, with only the top layer thawing in summer.
Greenland is largely covered by a permanent ice sheet.
Daylight:
The North Pole experiences six months of darkness followed by six months of constant daylight, while Arctic lands farther south have shorter periods of daylight in winter and brief darkness in summer.
Temperature:
Winters are extremely cold, with temperatures reaching −90°F (−68°C) inland, while summers are mild at around 50°F (10°C). Snowfall is heavier near the coasts.
Flora and Fauna
Plants:
Trees are scarce, growing only in southern regions. The tundras support lichens, mosses, grasses, and some flowering plants.
Animals:
The Arctic hosts polar bears, caribou, Arctic foxes, Arctic hares, gray wolves, seals, walruses, whales, and various fish. Birds like the snowy owl live year-round, while others migrate during summer.
Human Presence
Indigenous Peoples:
Indigenous groups like the Nenets, Sakha, Evenk, Chukchi, Sami, Inuit, and Aleuts traditionally inhabit the Arctic, living in small settlements.
Settlers:
In the 1900s, industries such as mining and oil drilling attracted settlers of European descent, who established larger towns and cities.
Key Findings
Near-Term Ice-Free Scenario
Nine simulations projected the first ice-free day could occur as early as September 2027 if conditions such as an unusually warm fall, winter, and spring, combined with stormy weather, align.
Extended Ice-Free Period
The simulations suggested the ice-free period could last between 11 and 53 days, potentially leading to the Arctic's first ice-free month.
Timing uncertain
While the exact timing of the first ice-free day is uncertain, scientists agree it is inevitable unless dramatic reductions in GHG emissions are achieved—a scenario deemed unlikely in the near future.
The occurrence of the first ice-free day may trigger more frequent events in subsequent years.
Driving Factors
Unprecedented GHG emissions are accelerating Arctic Sea ice decline.
Global surface concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide reached record highs in 2023, as reported by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
Impact on Climate Change
The loss of Arctic Sea ice accelerates climate change due to the
Albedo effect
, where the reflective ice is replaced by darker ocean water that absorbs more solar energy.
This leads to increased warming in the Arctic, triggering extreme weather events in mid-latitudes.
Rising Sea Levels
Global sea levels are already rising at an accelerated rate of 3.6 mm per year, 1.5 times faster than the 1990s.
If the Greenland ice sheet melts entirely, sea levels could rise by six meters, threatening coastal communities worldwide.
Ecosystem Disruption
Species like polar bears, walruses, Arctic foxes, snowy owls, and reindeer are at risk due to habitat loss and melting permafrost.
Marine animals are migrating further north for colder waters, disrupting food chains and dependent species.
Human and Infrastructure Impact
The Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average, endangering ecosystems, infrastructure, and livelihoods of Arctic communities.

**********Why Railways Amendment Bill 2024 was introduced?
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to Governance in Railawys;
Why in the News?
Amid intense debates between the government and the opposition, the Lok Sabha passed the Railways (Amendment) Bill, in 2024.
What were the significant key features of the bill?
Repeal of the Indian Railway Board Act, 1905:
The Bill repeals the 1905 Act, which governed the establishment and powers of the Railway Board. Provisions from the 1905 Act are now incorporated into the
Railways Act, of 1989
, for a unified legal framework.
It combines the provisions of the 1905 Act and the 1989 Act, reducing legislative redundancy and simplifying governance.
Constitution of the Railway Board:
It empowers the central government to determine:
The number of Railway Board members.
Qualifications, experience, and terms of service for the Chairman and members.
Method of appointment for these positions.
Streamlining Legal Provisions:
It consolidates provisions for easier administration and reduces the need for cross-referencing between multiple laws.
It enables the central government to prescribe updated qualifications and service terms for Railway Board members, potentially improving leadership quality.
Administrative Integration:
It maintains the Railway Board’s central authority while aiming for operational efficiency and uniformity in governance.
It aligns with recommendations for a modernized railway structure, paving the way for potential decentralization and private sector participation.
Development Goals
: The Bill is in line with India’s broader infrastructure and economic development objectives, which depend heavily on an efficient railway system.
Why did the Government Bring the Bill?
The government aims to repeal the
Indian Railway Board Act of 1905
and integrate its provisions into the
Railways Act of 1989,
simplifying the legal framework governing Indian Railways and reducing reliance on multiple laws.
The government argues that this integration will enhance the efficiency and development of railways, allowing for better governance and decision-making within the Railway Board.
Since its inception, the Railway Board has operated under the 1905 Act. The new Bill seeks to modernize this structure by aligning it with contemporary governance practices.
What did MPs Say About the Bill?
Support from Government MPs:
The ruling party MPs praised the Bill as a significant step towards modernizing and strengthening Indian Railways, asserting that it would enhance the functions and independence of the Railway Board.
Concerns from Opposition MPs:
Opposition members argued for an independent Railway Board free from government control and highlighted that the Bill does not address critical issues like:
Concerns About Privatization
: The Opposition party is worried that the new Bill could lead to the privatization of Indian Railways, making it less accessible to poorer people.
Loss of Independence:
Many Members of Parliament (MPs) are concerned that more government control over appointments to the Railway Board could reduce the independence of Indian Railways.
Restoration of Discounts
: Several MPs are calling for the return of fare discounts for senior citizens, journalists, and economically weaker groups, which were stopped during the pandemic.
Calls for Inclusivity:
Some MPs raised concerns about representation within the Railway Board, questioning whether marginalized groups would be adequately represented in appointments.
Way forward:
Strengthen Railway Board Autonomy
: Establish an independent regulatory framework to ensure the Railway Board operates with greater autonomy, focusing on safety, operational efficiency, and decentralization at zonal and divisional levels.
Inclusive Representation and Expertise
: Mandate merit-based appointments to the Railway Board, ensuring adequate representation of marginalized groups (SCs, STs, OBCs, and women) while emphasizing domain expertise for effective governance.
Mains PYQ:
The setting up of a Rail Tariff Authority to regulate fares will subject the cash strapped Indian Railways to demand subsidy for obligation to operate non-profitable routes and services. Taking into account the experience in the power sector, discuss if the proposed reform is expected to benefit the consumers, the Indian Railways or the private container operators.

Why in the News?
The fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria significantly challenges Iran’s regional influence, disrupting Tehran’s efforts to sustain its
“Shiite crescent”
strategy across the Middle East.
strategy refers to Iran’s geopolitical ambition to establish a contiguous sphere of influence among Shia-majority regions, extending from Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, thereby enhancing its regional power.
What are the Bilateral Ties between Iran and Syria?
Strategic Partnership:
Since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Syria has been Iran’s key ally, facilitating Iranian influence throughout the Levant. This partnership allowed Iran to support Hezbollah in Lebanon and maintain a foothold against Sunni Arab states.
Corridor for Influence:
Syria served as a vital corridor for Iranian resources and military support to its proxies, reinforcing Tehran’s “Shiite crescent” strategy aimed at linking Iran with its allies across the region.
Historical Context:
The relationship strengthened under Bashar al-Assad, despite being challenged by regional Sunni powers. The Assad regime’s reliance on Iranian support became more pronounced during the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011.
What are the challenges for Tehran?
Loss of Influence:
The fall of Assad represents a major setback for Iran, as it loses a critical ally needed to sustain its influence in the region. This diminishes Tehran’s ability to project power through its network of proxies and disrupts its strategic depth in the Levant.
Operational Setbacks:
Iran’s military presence in Syria had already been compromised by Israeli operations targeting Hezbollah leaders and other Iranian-affiliated groups. The loss of Assad exacerbates these challenges, leaving Tehran to reassess its military and diplomatic strategies.
Increased Regional Competition:
With Assad gone, regional powers like Turkey and Gulf states are likely to vie for influence in Syria, further complicating Iran’s position and diminishing its regional leverage.
What are the Geopolitical implications for the countries in the region?
Power Vacuum:
The collapse of Assad creates a power vacuum in which regional players such as
Turkey, Iran
, and
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states will compete to fill, recalibrating their strategies to safeguard national interests.
Increased Tensions:
Sunni Arab states may heighten efforts to counter Iranian influence, potentially leading to escalated sectarian tensions and a resurgence of militant groups like ISIS seeking to exploit the instability.
Israel’s Strategic Posture:
Israel is expected to adopt a more aggressive stance against Iranian-affiliated groups in Syria and Lebanon, aiming to prevent any reconstitution of Iranian influence along its borders.
Western Involvement:
U.S. and European nations
may intensify their involvement through diplomatic channels and interventions to curb Iranian expansion while preventing militant organizations from re-emerging in the region.
What are the steps taken by Indian government?
India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC):
Launched during India’s G20 presidency, this corridor aims to enhance connectivity and trade between India, the Middle East, and Europe. It seeks to integrate various countries, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and European nations, facilitating faster movement of goods and improving maritime security.
Joint Action Plan with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC):
India and the GCC have adopted a Joint Action Plan for 2024-2028, which encompasses cooperation in various sectors such as health, trade, energy, agriculture, and transportation.
Way forward:
Strengthen Diplomatic Ties:
Engage with key regional actors like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Turkey to promote stability in Syria and counterbalance Iranian influence while safeguarding India’s energy and trade interests in the Middle East.
Counter-Terrorism Collaboration:
Enhance intelligence-sharing and counter-terrorism cooperation with allies to mitigate the risks of militant groups like ISIS exploiting the instability in Syria.
Support Reconstruction Efforts:
Participate in Syria’s post-conflict reconstruction through investments in infrastructure, showcasing India’s soft power and gaining strategic goodwill in the region.
