Digital Public Infrastructure in the agriculture sector - Digital Agriculture Mission
Three pillars of Mission
Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES)
About
DPI refers to the
foundational digital systems that enable the delivery of essential public services and foster inclusive economic growth
These systems include a wide array of technologies, platforms, and services that support government functions, financial transactions, and social services.
DPI is designed to be interoperable, scalable, and accessible, enabling citizens and businesses to interact with the government and each other efficiently.
In India, notable examples include the Aadhaar system for unique identification, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for seamless financial transactions, and the CoWIN platform for managing COVID-19 vaccinations.
Benefits
Inclusivity and Accessibility
: The Aadhaar system has provided over 1.3 billion Indians with a unique identity, facilitating access to various government services and subsidies.
Economic Growth
: The UPI system, for example, has revolutionized financial transactions in India, making it easier for small businesses and individuals to engage in digital payments.
Efficiency and Transparency
: The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system in India, has significantly reduced leakages in welfare schemes by ensuring that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries directly.
Challenges
Digital Divide
: There remains a significant digital divide in India, with many people lacking access to the internet or digital literacy.
Privacy and Data Security
: The Aadhaar system, while effective, has faced criticism and legal challenges over data privacy concerns.
Interoperability and Scalability
: Integrating various state and national-level services with Aadhaar and UPI requires robust technical solutions.
The Digital Agriculture Mission aims to create a comprehensive Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in the agriculture sector, similar to India's other successful e-governance initiatives like
Aadhaar, DigiLocker, UPI, and electronic health records
The mission focuses on
three major DPI components
: AgriStack, Krishi Decision Support System (DSS), and Soil Profile Maps.
Additionally, the mission includes the
DGCES will leverage technology to provide accurate estimates of agricultural production, fostering a more informed and resilient agricultural ecosystem.
Funding for Mission
The Digital Agriculture Mission has a budgetary allocation of Rs 2,817 crore, with Rs 1,940 crore from the Centre and the remainder from states and Union Territories.
Announcement and coverage
Planned as part of the Agriculture Ministry's 100-day activities under the newly formed govt,
the Mission will be implemented nationwide by 2025-26
Initially set for launch in 2021-22, the Mission was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Announced in the Union Budgets of 2023-24 and 2024-25, the
Mission aims to cover farmers and their lands within three years
In 2024, a digital crop survey for the Kharif season will be conducted in 400 districts, incorporating details of 6 crore farmers and their lands into registries.
The basic IT infrastructure for implementing AgriStack is one of the three DPIs to be built under the Mission.
AgriStack consists of three foundational agri-sector registries or databases:
Farmers’ Registry
Farmers will receive a digital identity called a
'Farmer ID,'
similar to Aadhaar.
This ID will be dynamically linked to various records, including land ownership, livestock, crops, demographic details, family information, and schemes/benefits availed.
The government plans to create digital identities for 11 crore farmers, with 6 crore covered in 2024-25, 3 crore in 2025-26, and the remaining 2 crore in 2026-27.
This Registry will allow farmers to digitally identify and authenticate themselves to access benefits and services, reducing the need for paperwork and physical visits to offices.
Crop Sown Registry
It Registry will record details of crops planted by farmers, using information gathered through Digital Crop Surveys, which are mobile-based ground surveys conducted each crop season.
The government plans to roll out the Digital Crop Survey nationwide over the next two years, covering 400 districts in the 2024-25 financial year and the remaining districts in 2025-26.
Geo-referenced Village Maps
The maps will link geographic information on land records with their physical locations.
Krishi DSS
The Krishi Decision Support System is a recently unveiled geospatial platform that integrates remote sensing data on crops, soil, weather, and water resources.
It supports the generation of crop maps, helping to identify crop sown patterns, monitor droughts and floods, and assess yields using technology and models.
This system will also play a crucial role in settling crop insurance claims for farmers.
Under the Mission, detailed Soil Profile Maps (on a 1:10,000 scale) of about 142 million hectares of agricultural land are envisaged to be prepared.
A detailed soil profile inventory of about 29 million ha has already been completed.
This will greatly improve the existing crop yield estimation system, and to make the data more robust.
This, in turn, will address concerns that are sometimes raised about the accuracy of India’s agriculture production estimates.
By integrating digitally captured data on crop-sown areas with yield data from DGCES and remote-sensing data,
the system will enhance the reliability of crop production estimates
This improved data will help government agencies make schemes like paperless Minimum Support Price (MSP)-based procurement, crop insurance, and credit card-linked crop loans more efficient and transparent.
Additionally, the data will aid in facilitating crop diversification, evaluating irrigation needs based on crop and season, and promoting the balanced use of fertilizers.
The DGCES will provide scientifically-based yield estimates, further ensuring accurate agricultural production assessments.

**********RBI to Launch the Unified Lending Interface (ULI)
Why in News?
Unified Lending Interface (ULI), the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) technology platform to enable frictionless credit, will be launched nationwide soon.
Similar to Unified Payment Interface (UPI), which has revolutionised the retail payment system in the country, ULI will transform the lending landscape.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background in which the Idea of Unified Lending Interface (ULI) Developed
What is Unified Lending Interface (ULI)?
Background in which the Idea of Unified Lending Interface (ULI) Developed:
With rapid progress in digitalisation
, India has embraced the concept of digital public infrastructure (DPI) which encourages banks, NBFCs, fintech companies and start-ups to create and provide innovative solutions in
Payments,
Credit, and
Other financial activities.
For digital credit delivery,
the data required for credit appraisal are available with different entities like Central and State governments, account aggregators, banks, credit information companies and digital identity authorities.
As these data sets are in separate systems
, it creates hindrance in frictionless and timely delivery of rule-based lending.
A pilot project for the digitalisation of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans
of less than ₹1.6 lakh began in 2022.
The initial results of the KCC pilot were encouraging
as it enabled doorstep disbursement of loans without any paperwork.
In 2023
, the RBI had announced the setting up of a Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit which is now branded as the ULI.
About:
The ULI platform will facilitate a seamless and consent-based flow of digital information, including land records of various states, from multiple data service providers to lenders.
Objectives:
It will cut down the time
taken for credit appraisal, especially for smaller and rural borrowers.
It is aimed to bring about efficiency
in the lending process in terms of reduction of costs, quicker disbursement, and scalability.
Working:
The ULI architecture has common and standardised
APIs
(Application Programming Interface), designed for a ‘plug and play’ approach to ensure digital access to information from diverse sources.
For instance,
taking the example of a dairy farmer seeking a loan. The lender can find data from the milk cooperative to know about -
Cash flows;
Land ownership status from land records of States; and
Insights into his financial condition through farming patterns.
Thus, with the help of ULI the lenders can
immediately know the income of the loan applicant and credit eligibility
Thus, decision making would be automated
and loans could be sanctioned and disbursed within minutes.
Significance:
The platform will reduce the complexity
of multiple technical integrations by digitising access to customer’s financial and non-financial data that otherwise resided in disparate silos.
It is expected to cater to large unmet demand
for credit across various sectors, particularly for agricultural and MSME borrowers.
Tenant farmers
who often find it difficult to access agricultural credit can also avail loans by establishing their identity not through his land holding but through the end use of funds being disbursed.
The ‘new trinity’ of JAM-UPI-ULI
will be a revolutionary step forward in India’s digital infrastructure journey.
(Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile) trinity is a tool used by the government to transfer cash benefits directly to the bank account of the beneficiary.

**********Dealings at a China-Africa forum that India must track
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC);
Mains level:
India-Africa relation;
Why in the News?
The 9th edition of the
Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC)
is scheduled to be held in Beijing from 4th to 6th September, 2024.
About the China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC)
The Forum on
China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) was established in 2000
to enhance the
strategic partnership between China and African nations.
It serves as a platform for collective dialogue and cooperation in various sectors, including
trade, investment, and development.
Challenges of China-Africa Debt:
Chinese loans to African countries amounted to
approximately $170 billion from 2000 to 2022.
However, Chinese lenders represent only about
12% of Africa’s total public and private debt
, indicating that China is not the primary creditor.
A significant portion of
Chinese loans is not disclosed in sovereign debt records
, complicating the understanding of Africa’s overall debt levels. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the sustainability of these debts.
Despite concerns over
“debt trap diplomacy,”
China is unlikely to
forgive or cancel debts
but may consider
writing off smaller, interest-free loans.
African Priorities at FOCAC 2024
Economic Goals:
African nations are focusing on
enhancing trade relations with China
, with a
modest goal of $300 billion in imports from Africa between 2022-2024.
As of mid-2024,
trade has reached $167 billion,
primarily dominated by raw materials.
Agricultural Development:
There is a pressing need to develop a
sustainable
agricultural industry in Africa.
This includes improving the
processing of agricultural commodities
and leveraging the expertise of countries like China and India to
enhance crop resilience and productivity.
Green Energy and Industrialization:
African countries are advocating for the
establishment of refining and processing hubs to increase the value added from their raw materials.
What are the learnings that India can have?
Continuity in Engagement:
India should emphasize
consistent engagement with Africa,
particularly by
organizing the India-Africa Forum Summit (IAFS-IV)
to capitalize on recent momentum, especially after the
African Union’s inclusion in the G-20.
Support for Industrialization:
Indian companies are encouraged to invest in
higher value-added sectors in Africa,
such as
agriculture and pharmaceuticals,
to foster local employment and market development.
Private Sector Participation:
Greater involvement of the
Indian private sector is essential, along with innovative financing solutions
like public-private partnerships to support projects in Africa.
Digital and Financial Connectivity:
Utilizing
India’s digital stack and establishing rupee-based financial transactions
can enhance connectivity and
reduce forex risks for African nations.
Conclusion:
India should deepen its strategic partnerships with African nations by expanding bilateral and multilateral engagements, focusing on key sectors like healthcare, digital infrastructure, and renewable energy. Leveraging India’s experience in these areas can help address African development needs while enhancing India’s influence on the continent.

Mains level:
Pros and cons of Proportional Representation;
Why in the News?
On July 30, Germany’s constitutional court approved downsizing the Bundestag, citing concerns over financial strain and efficiency due to its unprecedented 736 deputies.
(Note:
The
is the
Lower house of Germany)
Why has the German Constitutional Court upheld the move to downsize the lower house of parliament?
Constitutional Rationale:
The court approved the plan to
reduce the size of the Bundestag to improve its efficiency and reduce costs,
as it had become the world’s largest elected assembly.
The court backed the government’s decision to limit the
Bundestag to 630 members by removing “overhang” and “balance” seats
, which had caused the number of legislators to grow significantly.
Legal Compliance:
The court’s decision aligns with previous rulings that
emphasized the need for electoral equality and the fair representation of political parties
ensuring that the election system remains constitutionally valid.
How does a mixed-member Proportional Representation system work?
Dual Voting System:
In Germany, each voter casts
two votes in federal elections
First Vote:
Directly elects a candidate from a
local constituency
via the
first-past-the-post method (299 seats)
Second Vote:
Chooses a political party,
which determines the
distribution of another 299 seats proportionally across Germany’s 16 regions.
Seat Allocation:
The second vote is crucial as it
determines the overall proportion of seats each party holds
in the Bundestag. The final seat count for each party is based on a combination of directly elected candidates and the proportion of the second vote.
Overhang Seats:
If a party wins
more direct seats than the proportion of the second vote would allow,
these
extra seats
are known as
“overhang seats.”
These were traditionally retained, leading to an increase in the total number of seats.
How does a mixed-member Proportional Representation system work in India?
No MMP System in India:
does not use a mixed-member proportional representation system
at the national level. The Indian electoral system primarily follows the
first-past-the-post method,
where the candidate with the
most votes in each constituency wins a seat in the parliament.
Proportional Representation:
In India,
proportional representation (Single transferable
) is used
only in certain cases, such as elections to the Rajya Sabha (the upper house) and the President
Types of Proportional Representation:
Single Transferable Vote (STV):
This system allows
voters to rank candidates in order of preference.
It is used to elect members of the
Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the President of India.
Party-List PR:
In this system, voters
cast their votes for a party rather than individual candidates.
Seats are allocated to
each party based on the proportion of votes they receive
. A
minimum threshold (usually between 3-5%)
is often required for a party to gain representation, preventing excessive fragmentation in the legislature.
Mixed-Member Proportional Representation (MMP):
This combines elements of
FPTP and PR, allowing voters to cast two votes—one for a candidate and another for a party.
This system aims to balance the benefits of direct representation with proportionality.
What are balance or overhang seats and why were they deemed Unconstitutional?
These are additional seats that a party wins when it secures
more direct constituency seats than it would be entitled to based on its second vote share.
This situation arises
due to the mixed-member proportional system.
Balance Seats:
Introduced to maintain proportionality and fairness,
balance seats are given to other parties to offset the overhang seats,
ensuring that the overall seat distribution reflects the second vote shares accurately.
Unconstitutionality:
In 2008, the German Constitutional Court ruled that the increasing number of overhang seats violated the principle of electoral equality. The recent judgment further
upheld the move to eliminate these seats to simplify the electoral system
and maintain fairness.
Conclusion:
Germany should swiftly implement the downsizing plan, ensuring that the transition to a 630-member Bundestag is smooth and transparent, with clear communication to the public and political parties.
Mains PYQ:
Critically examine the procedures through which the Presidents of India and France are elected.
