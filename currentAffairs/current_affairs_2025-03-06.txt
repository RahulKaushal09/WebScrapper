ISRO recently successfully conducted the hot test on a semi-cryogenic engine (SE2000), coming closer to finalising the crucial cryogenic stage.
About Semi-Cryogenic Engine:
A semi-cryogenic engine (SCE) is a liquid rocket engine that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer and refined kerosene as fuel.
The
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
is developing a semi-cryogenic engine with a
thrust of 2000 kN
to power the booster stages of future heavy-lift launch vehicles. This engine utilizes a combination of liquid oxygen (LOX) and refined kerosene (RP-1) as propellants.
The semi-cryogenic engine offers several advantages over traditional cryogenic engines, including:
Higher Density Impulse:
The LOX-kerosene combination provides a higher density impulse compared to LOX-liquid hydrogen, resulting in improved performance.
Cost-Effectiveness:
Kerosene is more cost-effective and easier to handle than liquid hydrogen, reducing overall mission costs.
Operational Efficiency:
Kerosene can be stored at ambient temperatures, simplifying storage and handling requirements.
The development of this engine is expected to enhance the payload capacity of ISRO's existing launch vehicles, such as the
LVM3

**********Endogamy — A Major Cause for Health Disparity in India
Why in the News?
Recently a study on the topic of Endogamy in India conducted by CSIR Bhatnagar Fellow at the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and senior scientist
K. Thangaraj
has been published.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context)
Endogamy in India (Caste System, Regional & Linguistic Endogamy, Genetic Implications, etc.)
News Summary (CSIR Report Highlights)
Introduction:
Endogamy, or the practice of marrying within a specific social, caste, or religious group, has been a long-standing tradition in India.
It is deeply rooted in the country's cultural and social structures, particularly within caste and tribal communities.
While endogamy has historically been seen as a way to preserve community identity, customs, and social cohesion, modern studies have highlighted its significant implications for genetic health.
A recent study by the
reveals that endogamy contributes to
population-specific diseases
The study, conducted by senior scientist
K.Thangaraj
and his team, provides key insights into how genetic mutations arising from endogamy can influence health outcomes and drug responses.
Endogamy in India: A Cultural and Social Perspective:
Endogamy has traditionally played a vital role in maintaining
social hierarchy and group identity
in India. Some of the key factors influencing its practice include:
Caste System & Social Structure
varna (caste) system
in Hindu society promotes marriage within one's caste and sub-caste to maintain social status and hereditary occupations.
Similar trends are observed among
Muslim, Christian, and tribal communities
, where intra-group marriages are encouraged to maintain religious and cultural identity.
Certain linguistic groups in India also practice
regional endogamy
, restricting marriage within their own community to preserve cultural traditions and dialects.
Example: The
Tamil Brahmins
Gujarati Patels
Marwari business communities
follow strict endogamy.
Economic & Political Influence
Endogamous marriages help preserve
family wealth, political power, and business interests
by preventing external influences from diluting family assets and decision-making.
Many
business families in India
, such as those in Gujarat and Rajasthan, prefer marrying within their communities for financial stability.
Genetic Implications of Endogamy:
While endogamy has historically served as a means of cultural preservation, recent genetic research highlights its potential drawbacks.
Increased Risk of Genetic Disorders
The CSIR-CCMB study found that
marrying within small communities leads to a higher prevalence of genetic mutations
, which increase the risk of hereditary diseases.
Ankylosing Spondylitis
(a type of arthritis) is more common among the
Reddy community of Andhra Pradesh
due to the presence of a specific genetic variant,
HLA-B27:04 risk allele
Other
population-specific genetic disorders
have also been observed, emphasizing the role of
genetic screening and counselling
Drug Metabolism & Personalized Medicine
The study also examined
pharmacogenomic markers
, revealing that certain communities process medications differently due to
genetic variations
Drugs such as
Tacrolimus
(an immunosuppressant) and
Warfarin
(a blood thinner) have different effects in individuals from different genetic backgrounds, highlighting the need for
personalized medicine
Need for Genetic Counselling
Dr. Thangaraj and his team suggest that
genetic counselling and screening programs
be introduced to identify
high-risk groups
and provide medical guidance.
This is particularly relevant in
rural and marginalized communities
, where knowledge of genetic disorders remains limited.
News Summary:
A study led by the
highlights that
endogamy is a major contributor to health disparities in India
Some key takeaways from the research include:
Genetic mutations
caused by endogamous marriages are responsible for
in specific populations.
The study underscores the need for
genetic screening, counselling, and medical interventions
to manage population-specific health risks.
The findings, published in the Journal of Genetics and Genomics, mark an important step in
understanding India's genetic landscape
and developing
better diagnostic and treatment strategies
Conclusion:
Endogamy has been a defining feature of India's
social and cultural fabric
, shaping identities and traditions across generations.
However, its
genetic consequences
raise concerns about
hereditary diseases and drug response variations
With new
scientific research
shedding light on the health impact of
inbreeding and genetic mutations
, the need for
genetic counselling, public awareness, and improved healthcare policies
has become more urgent than ever.
Future strategies must focus on
balancing cultural traditions with medical advancements
to ensure better
health outcomes for all communities

**********Trump announces reciprocal tariffs from April 2
Why in news?
US President Donald Trump announced the implementation of
on trade partners starting April 2, regardless of their economic status.
In his Joint Address to Congress, he criticized both friendly and unfriendly nations, including India, China, and the European Union, for imposing higher tariffs on US products.
Trump highlighted India’s over 100% auto tariffs and claimed that countries like China and South Korea impose significantly higher duties compared to the US. He argued that these disparities have persisted for decades, despite US military and economic support to some of these nations.
What’s in today’s article?
Current Status of Trade Between India and USA
Uncertainty for India Amid US Tariff Plans
Farm Sector Vulnerability Amid US Tariff Plans
Auto and Pharma Sectors Face Tariff Risks
US Challenges WTO’s Relevance and Policies
As per U.S. estimates, the U.S. total goods trade with India was an estimated $129.2 billion in 2024.
The U.S. goods exports to India in 2024 were $41.8 billion, up 3.4% ($1.4 billion) from 2023.
U.S. goods imports from India totalled $87.4 billion in 2024, up 4.5% ($3.7 billion) from 2023.
The U.S. goods trade deficit with India was $45.7 billion in 2024, a 5.4% increase ($2.4 billion) over 2023.
US President Donald Trump reiterated his criticism of India’s high tariffs, particularly in the auto sector, where duties exceed 100%.
His remarks signal that ongoing trade negotiations may not secure concessions for India, especially on reciprocal tariffs set to take effect from April 2.
Bilateral Trade Agreement at Risk
India and the US are working on a bilateral trade agreement (BTA), with Indian officials seeking relief from tariffs, including the 25% duty on steel and aluminum.
Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal is in the US to discuss the issue with United States Trade Representative (USTR) who is overseeing Trump’s tariff policies.
Concerns Over US Commitment to Trade Deals
Trade experts warn that Trump’s tariff decisions, such as the 25% duties on Canada and Mexico, indicate a disregard for WTO norms and existing trade agreements.
The imposition of these tariffs raises doubts about America’s adherence to future trade deals, including one with India.
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
, the trade deal between the US, Canada, and Mexico, had been in place since January 1994.
However, Trump was dissatisfied with its terms and, during his first term, replaced it with the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
in 2018-19.
Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico violate USMCA and highlight his disregard for negotiated trade agreements.
India's agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to US reciprocal tariffs due to significant differences in tariff rates between the two countries.
Farmers’ unions continue to push for a legally guaranteed Minimum Support Price (MSP), adding to the sector’s sensitivity.
High Tariff Disparity Between India and the US
According to an ICRIER report,
India imposes an average tariff of 17% compared to 3.3% by the US
The gap is even wider in agriculture, where India’s simple average tariff is 39% and the trade-weighted rate is 65%, while the US maintains much lower rates of 5% and 4%, respectively.
India’s automobile and pharmaceutical sectors, among its most successful industries, face potential setbacks due to US reciprocal tariffs.
With countries demanding greater access to India’s protected markets, these industries may see higher costs and reduced competitiveness in the US.
Strategies for Indian Industries
A GTRI report suggests that Indian firms should explore alternative export markets such as Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa, where tariff barriers are lower.
Additionally, forming joint ventures with American firms or setting up assembly units in the US could help mitigate the impact of tariffs.
The US 2025 Trade Policy Agenda, released on March 3, claims that the World Trade Organization (WTO) is losing its relevance and has deviated from its original purpose of promoting open, market-oriented trade.
The document criticizes the WTO’s Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) provisions, which allow developing countries like India to access benefits such as extended transition periods, higher tariff bindings, and subsidies.
It argues that
nations can claim SDT status by self-declaring as ‘developing,’ without objective criteria
The policy highlights China’s shift away from market-oriented reforms since its 2001 WTO accession.
It accuses the WTO of failing to address China’s state-led economic practices, which the US sees as incompatible with the organization's founding principles.

**********Empowering Women in Panchayati Raj - Overcoming Proxy Leadership
Context:
True development
extends beyond economic growth to
empowerment, inclusivity, and dignity.
Panchayati Raj Institutions (
PRIs
)
reserve 33-50% seats for women
to ensure the inclusion of marginalised voices in local governance.
While these quotas have undoubtedly brought more women into leadership roles, the system has revealed
a persistent challenge of proxy leadership
The Challenge of Proxy Leadership:
Many elected women sarpanches are
overshadowed by male family members
Reasons include
patriarchal norms
, lack of education, lack governance knowledge and institutional support, and systemic weaknesses.
Male involvement is often justified as support but
weakens women’s authority
Training programs often fail
due to a patronizing approach towards women leaders.
The Story of Chhavi Rajawat:
As
India’s first MBA sarpanch
, her journey in rural leadership began in 2010 through a seat reserved for women.
Her re-election in 2015 (in a general seat) was a testament to the power of inclusive and performance-driven governance.
But her case is an exception
. Across many panchayats, women leaders continue to struggle due to
systemic hurdles
Institutional biases and dismissive attitudes
towards women sarpanches undermine their authority.
Positive examples show that
proactive government officials can empower women
Strengthening women’s leadership:
Capacity building and training:
The programme for Jharkhand
panchayat leaders showcased how structured learning can empower local representatives.
The training included
aspects of governance, budgeting, planning, funding, risk and conflict management, communication and digital literacy -
including AI tools like ChatGPT
Such programmes must become the norm, not the exception.
Quarterly training sessions
should be conducted for two years post-election.
Policy recommendations:
A government committee has proposed
nine key recommendations
to strengthen women’s leadership.
Former sarpanches should be involved in policy making.
A minimum qualification
of 12th grade should be mandated for elected representatives.

**********Over-Centralisation Threatens Federal Health Policy
Context
The recent Supreme Court judgment in
Dr.
Tanvi Behl vs Shrey Goyal (2025),
which
struck down domicile-based reservations in post-graduate medical admissions
, marks a pivotal moment in India's medical education policy.
By dismantling a key mechanism for States to ensure a stable and locally rooted medical workforce,
the decision risks exacerbating regional disparities in healthcare access.
A deeper examination of the judgment reveals potential flaws in its reasoning,
particularly in its rigid interpretation of meritocracy and its failure to recognise the intricate relationship between medical education and State health policy.
The Significance of Domicile Quotas in State Health Planning
Domicile-based reservations in post-graduate medical courses
play a crucial role in aligning State investments in medical education
with long-term health system needs.
States invest substantial public resources in medical education
with the expectation that graduates will contribute to the local healthcare infrastructure.
This is
particularly significant given the acute shortage of specialists in many regions.
By ensuring that a portion of post-graduate seats are reserved for local candidates
, States create a predictable pipeline of doctors who are more likely to remain and serve within the State.
Drawbacks of the SC Judgement
The Judgement Overlooks an Essential Distinction
SC’s reliance on Pradeep Jain vs Union of India (1984)
to justify the elimination of domicile quotas
overlooks an essential distinction
between undergraduate and post-graduate medical education.
While undergraduate medical programs provide foundational training,
post-graduate courses are where doctors acquire specialised skills crucial to public health.
Removing domicile quotas disrupts this specialist training pipeline, forcing States to rely on unpredictable external recruitment,
which is neither efficient nor sustainable.
Undermining Competitive Federalism and State-Level Health Planning
Moreover,
the judgment undermines the incentive for States to invest in medical education
Competitive federalism encourages States to develop strong institutions
, but if they cannot ensure that their investment translates into a local specialist workforce, they may deprioritise funding for government medical colleges.
This could lead to deteriorating infrastructure
and an increasing gap between regional healthcare facilities.
While premier central institutions like AIIMS and PGIMER retain full autonomy in admissions,
State medical colleges, arguably more vital to India's public health system, are denied the same prerogative.
structural imbalance may further weaken State-level healthcare planning.
Narrow Interpretation of Constitutional Concerns
The right to life under
Article 21
of the Indian Constitution encompasses access to adequate healthcare.
Since public health falls under State legislative competence,
the role of government medical colleges extends beyond academics;
they are an integral part of the State's healthcare system.
The Court’s narrow interpretation,
which treats medical colleges merely as institutions for professional training,
ignores their broader function as pillars of public health infrastructure.
A more holistic approach,
recognising the interdependence of medical education, healthcare access, and federalism,
is essential for crafting policies that strengthen rather than weaken State healthcare systems.
The Fallacy of Supreme Court’s Reliance on Absolute Meritocracy
The SC’s insistence on a rigid, meritocratic framework
for medical admissions
disregards structural inequities
within India's medical entrance system.
The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Postgraduate)
(NEET-PG) has been criticised
for its flaws, including the fact that candidates with negative marks
may still qualify due to percentile-based cutoffs.
Additionally,
in 2023, the National Medical Commission lowered the qualifying percentile
for NEET-PG to zero to fill vacant seats, raising questions about how merit is assessed in practice.
If undergraduate admissions consider regional and socio-economic disparities,
there is little justification for excluding these factors from post-graduate admissions.
Prior SC rulings,
such as Jagdish Saran vs Union of India (1982) and Neil Aurelio Nunes vs Union of India (2022),
have acknowledged that merit cannot be evaluated in isolation from its social context.
more meaningful conception of merit should incorporate considerations of regional healthcare needs and the likelihood
of candidates serving in underserved areas.
Economic Survey 2024-25 has highlighted how domicile-based reservations enhance healthcare access and mitigate regional disparities,
reinforcing the argument that an inclusive definition of merit is necessary.
Implications of Over-Centralisation and The Way Forward
Over-centralisation
, especially when driven by judicial rulings,
restricts States' ability to formulate policies
that align with their socio-economic and public health contexts.
If the judiciary and legislatures do not acknowledge the
vital role that domicile-based reservations play in sustaining the healthcare workforce,
States will struggle
to retain medical professionals, ultimately harming public health outcomes.
The Way Forward: Need for Reconsideration
While the
Court's decision aligns with legal precedents, it does not adequately reflect the evolving realities
of India’s healthcare system.
framework established in Pradeep Jain (1984) was formulated in a different public health landscape,
and the challenges of retaining specialists within State health systems have become more pressing, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.
more balanced approach would integrate domicile quotas
with public service obligations.
For instance,
Tamil Nadu's medical education policy links quotas to service mandates in public institutions,
ensuring that State investment yields tangible healthcare benefits.
Rather than eliminating domicile-based reservations outright,
judicial and policy frameworks should explore models that balance merit with the need for a stable and regionally distributed medical workforce.
Conclusion
SC’s judgment
in Dr. Tanvi Behl vs Shrey Goyal (2025) reflects
a well-intentioned but overly rigid application of meritocracy.
By reinforcing centralised control over medical admissions,
the ruling undermines State investment in medical education, weakens the public health system
, and exacerbates regional disparities.
If India aims to build a sustainable healthcare framework, judicial doctrine must evolve to accommodate the complex interplay
between medical education, federalism, and public health policy.

and
Public health system
(2015).
The Supreme Court’s judgment in Dr. Tanvi Behl vs Shrey Goyal (2025), striking down domicile-based reservations in post-graduate medical admissions, changes India’s medical education policy. While promoting merit, it overlooks how these reservations support State public health needs and may discourage States from investing in government medical colleges, weakening their healthcare systems.
Today’s editorial discusses domicile-based reservations, which is useful for writing answers in UPSC Mains GS Paper 2 on Governance, especially regarding State policies and public health challenges.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
The ruling that ended domicile-based reservations in post-graduate medical admissions ignores the practical challenges of managing public health.
What are Domicile-based reservations?
are quotas in educational institutions or government jobs reserved for individuals who are permanent residents of a particular State or region. These reservations aim to address local needs, ensure regional representation, and retain skilled professionals within the State.
For example,
Tamil Nadu
, a portion of post-graduate medical seats is reserved for candidates who have completed their medical education in the State.
What are the key arguments made by the Supreme Court in striking down domicile-based reservations?
Violation of Article 14 (Right to Equality):
The Court held that domicile-based reservations in post-graduate medical admissions violate
of the Constitution, which guarantees
equality before the law
Example:
It argued that restricting access to medical seats based on domicile status is
discriminatory
against equally qualified non-local candidates.
Primacy of Meritocracy in Higher Education:
The judgment emphasized that
should be the primary criterion for post-graduate medical admissions to ensure the best candidates receive specialist training.
It relied on
Pradeep Jain vs Union of India (1984)
, where the Court discouraged domicile-based quotas, stating that such policies
dilute academic standards
in advanced medical training.
Uniform and Centralized Medical Education Framework:
The Court favored a
national, merit-based system
to maintain
uniformity
in medical admissions across States and prevent fragmentation.
It pointed to central institutions like
AIIMS and PGIMER
, which follow a
centralized selection
process without domicile reservations, ensuring open competition for all candidates.
Why is domicile-based reservation considered crucial for State-level?
Retention of Specialist Doctors in Public Health Systems:
Domicile quotas ensure that medical graduates trained in State institutions are more likely to
serve within the State
, addressing local health-care needs.
States with severe
specialist shortages
(e.g., rural Bihar or Odisha) rely on domicile-based reservations to retain medical professionals and improve health outcomes.
Alignment of State Investment with Local Workforce Needs:

in medical education and expect returns through a
local medical workforce
. Domicile quotas ensure these investments benefit the State’s health infrastructure.
links domicile-based quotas to
mandatory public service
, ensuring that doctors trained using State funds serve in government hospitals.
Addressing Regional Health Disparities:
Domicile reservations help in reducing
regional imbalances
by ensuring that
underserved areas
have access to medical specialists who understand local challenges.
Northeastern States
with limited access to advanced medical care use domicile quotas to maintain a local pool of doctors familiar with
tribal and rural health needs
Predictable Medical Workforce Supply:
States depend on domicile quotas to create a
steady pipeline
of medical specialists who can fulfill long-term public health needs.
Maharashtra
implements domicile-based reservations to ensure consistent recruitment for
rural health centers
and district hospitals.
Incentivizing State Investment in Medical Education:
If States cannot ensure that their medical graduates remain local, they may
reduce funding
for medical colleges, weakening health infrastructure.
Without domicile quotas,

**********U.S. will impose reciprocal tariffs from April 2: Trump
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India-USA relation;
Why in the News?
U.S. President Donald Trump criticised the high tariffs imposed by India and other countries, calling them “very unfair,” and announced that
would be implemented from April 2 on nations that levy duties on American goods.
What are the main reasons for imposing reciprocal tariffs on countries like India and China?
High Import Tariffs Imposed by These Countries
: The U.S. administration has expressed concerns over the substantial tariffs that nations such as India and China impose on American goods. For instance, India charges auto tariffs exceeding 100%.
Trade Imbalances
: The U.S. aims to address significant trade deficits with countries like China. By imposing reciprocal tariffs, the U.S. seeks to encourage these nations to reduce their tariffs and open their markets to American products, thereby promoting fairer trade practices.
Protection of Domestic Industries
: High tariffs from countries like China have adversely affected U.S. industries, particularly manufacturing and agriculture. The reciprocal tariffs are intended to protect these sectors from unfair competition and to support domestic employment.
Why did USA’s President emphasize that India “will not be spared” from the reciprocal tariff measures?
The U.S. President emphasized that
from reciprocal tariff measures due to several key factors:
High Tariffs Imposed by India on U.S. Goods:
The U.S. argues that India imposes excessively high tariffs on American products, particularly in the automobile and agricultural sectors.
Example:
India levies over
100% import duty on U.S. motorcycles
like Harley-Davidson, which the U.S. considers an unfair trade barrier.
Trade Imbalance Between the U.S. and India:
The U.S. has consistently faced a
trade deficit with India
, meaning India exports more to the U.S. than it imports. This imbalance is viewed as economically disadvantageous.
2023
, the U.S. trade deficit with India was approximately
$42 billion
, prompting calls for more balanced trade relations.
Market Access Restrictions:
The U.S. claims India imposes
non-tariff barriers
and complex regulatory frameworks, limiting American companies’ access to the Indian market.
U.S. agricultural products such as
dairy
face strict Indian regulations on sourcing and labeling, restricting their market entry.
Retaliation Against U.S. Tariff Policies:
India has imposed
retaliatory tariffs
on several U.S. products in response to American tariffs on steel and aluminum. This reciprocal action has escalated trade tensions.
After the U.S. raised tariffs on
Indian steel (25%) and aluminum (10%)
, India imposed
tariffs on U.S. agricultural products
like almonds and apples.
Strategic Leverage in Trade Negotiations:
By targeting major trading partners like India, the U.S. aims to pressure these countries into
negotiating more favorable trade agreements
The U.S. sought
reduced tariffs on electric vehicles
to facilitate the entry of companies like
Tesla
into the Indian market, using tariff threats as a bargaining tool.
What are the potential global trade implications of the U.S. imposing reciprocal tariffs?
Escalation of Global Trade Wars:
Reciprocal tariffs can trigger
retaliatory measures
from affected countries, leading to prolonged trade conflicts and increased global economic uncertainty.
After the U.S. imposed tariffs on
Chinese goods
under Section 301, China retaliated with tariffs on
, disrupting global supply chains and trade flows.
Rising Costs for Consumers and Businesses:
Increased tariffs raise the
cost of imported goods
, leading to higher prices for consumers and increased production costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains.
U.S. tariffs on
Chinese electronics
increased costs for American companies like
Apple
, which faced higher prices for components and devices.
Disruption of Global Trade Agreements and Alliances:
Imposing unilateral tariffs undermines
multilateral trade frameworks
like the
World Trade Organization (WTO)
, weakening global cooperation and trade stability.
European steel and aluminum
strained transatlantic relations and led the
EU
to impose counter-tariffs on
American motorcycles and bourbon
How will it impact India?
Widening of the Current Account Deficit (CAD):
Higher U.S. tariffs on Indian exports can
reduce foreign exchange earnings
, leading to a
wider CAD
as export revenue declines while import costs remain unchanged or increase.
U.S. withdrawal of GSP benefits
in 2019 reduced India’s export competitiveness, contributing to a
widened CAD of 2.1% of GDP
in FY19 from
1.8% in FY18
Depreciation of the Indian Rupee:
A higher CAD increases
demand for foreign currency
, putting pressure on the
rupee’s value
and causing depreciation, which raises the cost of imports like
crude oil
2018
, after U.S. tariffs and India’s
rising oil import bill
rupee fell to ₹74 per USD
, increasing
inflation
and making imported goods more expensive.
Reduced Export Competitiveness:
Higher tariffs on Indian goods in the U.S. market can make
Indian products more expensive
, reducing their competitiveness and affecting export-driven industries.
Indian steel and aluminum
(25% and 10%, respectively) in 2018 affected Indian exporters, leading to a decline in shipments and increased production costs.
Disruption in Key Sectors:
Industries such as
pharmaceuticals, textiles, and auto parts
—major contributors to India’s exports—could face higher barriers, impacting growth and employment.
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)
benefits in 2019 affected
$6 billion
worth of Indian exports, especially in
textiles and jewelry
Way forward:
Bilateral Trade Negotiations:
Strengthen diplomatic efforts to negotiate
mutually beneficial trade agreements
with the U.S., focusing on
reducing tariffs
and enhancing
market access
for key sectors like
pharmaceuticals, textiles, and technology
Diversification of Export Markets:
Reduce dependency on the U.S. by
exploring new markets
through
regional trade agreements
(e.g.,
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements
) and expanding in regions like
Africa and Southeast Asia
