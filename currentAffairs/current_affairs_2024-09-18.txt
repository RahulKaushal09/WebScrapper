Exploding pagers in Lebanon
Why in news?
In Lebanon, thousands were injured after pagers used by Hezbollah, a militant group, exploded almost simultaneously across the country. The blasts resulted in at least nine deaths and around 2,800 injuries, many of them severe.
The cause of the attack remains unclear, but it appears to have been highly sophisticated. Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the incident, though Israeli officials have not yet commented on the matter.

Pager
Lebanon attacks
About
Hezbollah, meaning "Party of God," is considered the world’s most heavily armed non-state actor, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
The group possesses a wide range of weaponry, including rockets and missiles.
The group opposes Israel and Western influence in the region, and it has supported Syria's President Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war.
In the mid-2000s, Hezbollah became more involved in Lebanese politics and now holds seats in the country's parliament.
However, it has faced increasing protests due to worsening economic conditions in Lebanon.
Formation
It originated during the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), a conflict partly fueled by the presence of Palestinian refugees after the creation of Israel in 1948, which led to Israeli invasions of southern Lebanon in 1978 and 1982.
Hezbollah was formed around this period, inspired by Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution, and has received funding and support from Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
A pager, or beeper, is a small, portable device used for receiving and sometimes sending short messages or alerts.
Pagers receive messages through radio frequencies from a base station or central dispatch.
Messages can be numeric or alphanumeric, which are then displayed to the user.
Two-way pagers allow users to send and receive messages, similar to early text messaging.
Operation
Pagers operate on dedicated radio frequencies and are designed to receive messages over these frequencies.
The range of a pager depends on the frequency band used and the coverage area of the paging network.
Popularity in Professional Use
Pagers were widely used in the late 1990s and early 2000s, especially in professions requiring reliable communication, such as healthcare and emergency services.
They do not rely on cellular networks, making them more dependable in areas with poor cellular coverage.
Types of Pagers
Numeric Pagers
: Display only numbers, often used to send phone numbers or simple alerts.
Alphanumeric Pagers
: Display both letters and numbers, allowing for more detailed messages.
Advantages of using a pager
Pagers are ideal for quick alerts and reliable communication, especially in remote areas where cellular signals might be weak.
They are straightforward devices, simple to use, and less prone to technical issues.
One-way pagers are generally untraceable because there is no signal transmission to the base station that sends the signal in the first place.
Reasons behind its decline
With the rise of mobile phones and their extensive features, the use of pagers has declined significantly over time.
Mobile phones offer more advanced communication options, including voice calls, text messages, and internet access.
About the news
A spree of simultaneous detonations of pagers across Lebanon killed nine people and injured around 3000.
Hezbollah has been using such devices for years to make it harder for their messages to be intercepted.
The Hezbollah said in a statement that pagers used by people working for the group’s institutions began exploding mysteriously.
Who is responsible for the attack?
The attack took place a day after Israeli leaders had said they were considering stepping up their military campaign against Hezbollah.
Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the incident. Israel has not commented on this incident so far.
Israel-Hezbollah conflict heating up
On October 8, 2023, Hezbollah began exchanging fire with Israel, a day after Hamas launched attacks in southern Israel, igniting the Israel-Gaza conflict.
As a Hamas ally, Hezbollah claims its attacks are in support of Palestinians under Israeli bombardment in Gaza.
The conflict has drawn in Iran-backed militants across the region, with Hezbollah being the strongest member of the "Axis of Resistance."
While connected to Gaza, the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has its own dynamics, with the two having fought multiple wars, the last major one being in 2006.
Israel views Hezbollah as a major threat, particularly due to its growing arsenal and influence in Syria.
Exploding pagers: an indication of Supply chain infiltration
Initial speculation suggested that the pager explosions in Lebanon were caused by a hack that overheated the batteries, but this theory was quickly dismissed based on footage of the blasts.
Cybersecurity experts described the event as potentially one of the largest physical supply chain attacks in history.
Following warnings from Hezbollah to avoid mobile phones over fears of Israeli tampering, the group had switched to using pagers.
A new batch of pagers was recently delivered, and
experts suspect that Israel may have infiltrated the supply chain, possibly planting military-grade explosives inside the devices
Experts suggested the pagers could have been armed via an electronic signal, such as an alphanumeric message.
According to a Hezbollah official, the devices were programmed to beep for several seconds before exploding, although the exact method behind the explosions remains unclear.

**********What Powers will the new Jammu and Kashmir Assembly have?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Constitutional Changes Post 2019 (Governance Structure, Legislative Powers, Delhi Assembly Comparison, Role of LG, etc.)
Introduction:
The first phase of polling for the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly is set to commence on from 18
Sep, 2024.
This election is particularly significant as it marks the
first since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019
, fundamentally altering the political and constitutional landscape of the region.
new Assembly will represent a Union Territory (UT) rather than a state
, introducing substantial changes to the governance structure.
Constitutional Changes Post-2019:
In August 2019, Jammu and Kashmir's statehood was revoked, and it was bifurcated into two Union Territories—
Jammu and Kashmir with a legislature
Ladakh without a legislature
This restructuring was made possible through the
Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019
, which amended the First Schedule of the Constitution to reflect the new status and provided a fresh framework for governance under
Article 239
, which governs Union Territories.
Governance Structure of Jammu and Kashmir:
The governance of the new UT of Jammu and Kashmir is unique, akin to the model followed by the Union Territories of
Delhi and Puducherry
, but with some distinctions.
Under
Article 239A
, the region will have a Legislative Assembly, similar to Puducherry.
However, the powers of this Assembly will differ substantially from the powers held by states.
Powers of the Legislative Assembly:
outlines the specific powers of the Legislative Assembly.
Section 32
of the Act states that the Assembly may make laws on matters in the
State List
, except for critical areas like public order and police.
Additionally, the Assembly can legislate on subjects in the
Concurrent List
, as long as such laws do not conflict with central legislation.
Section 36
introduces an important condition for financial legislation.
Any Bill related to financial obligations must be recommended by the
Lieutenant Governor (LG)
before being introduced in the Assembly.
This gives the LG substantial control over policies that could impact the region’s finances.
Comparison with Delhi's Governance Model:
The governance structure of Jammu and Kashmir can be compared to Delhi, another Union Territory with a legislature.
However, Delhi's powers are limited, with key areas such as land, public order, and police under the direct control of the
Disputes between the Delhi government and the LG have often led to legal battles, particularly over control of
services
(the bureaucracy).
In Jammu and Kashmir, the LG has similar control over public order, police, and anti-corruption matters.
2019 Act also allows the LG to exercise discretion on issues outside the purview of the Legislative Assembly
, thus giving the LG considerable influence in governance.
Role of the Lieutenant Governor:
in Jammu and Kashmir holds significant authority, as defined under
Section 53
of the 2019 Act.
The LG can act independently in matters beyond the legislative powers of the Assembly, including the
All India Services
Anti-Corruption Bureau
Moreover, the
LG's decisions cannot be easily challenged in court
, making the office a powerful administrative entity.
In the lead-up to the elections, several administrative changes have further extended the powers of the LG.
These changes include the ability to appoint the
Advocate General
, law officers, and participate in decisions related to prosecution and sanctions.
Conclusion:
The upcoming Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections mark a new chapter in the region’s governance, with a drastically altered political and constitutional framework post-2019.
The region now functions as a Union Territory with a limited legislative assembly, much like Delhi and Puducherry, but with additional checks in place through the enhanced powers of the LG.
How these changes will impact governance and the balance of power between the Centre and the region remains to be seen, especially as the region moves towards a new political and administrative reality.

**********Relative Economic Performance of Indian States
Why in News?
The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) recently released a working paper titled ‘
Relative Economic Performance of Indian States: 1960-61 to 2023-24
.’
The analysis spans a long period, from 1960-61 to 2023- 24, providing insights into how individual states have performed in response to changes in national and state-specific policies.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM)?
Indicators Used to Capture Relative Economic Performance of States
Regional Analysis of Relative Economic Performance of States
What may be Inferred from the States' Relative Economic Performance?
It is a
non-constitutional, non-permanent and independent
body constituted to give economic advice to the Government of India, specifically the
It has been
constituted several times since the independence
of India. In
2017
, the body was
revived
currently
the PMEAC chairman post is held by
Bibek Debroy.
The council serves to highlight key economic issues facing the country to the government of India from a neutral viewpoint.
It advises the PM on economic issues like
inflation, microfinance, and industrial output.
Indicators Used to Capture Relative Economic Performance of States:
Two indicators:
The paper focuses exclusively on the relative performance of states, measured using two indicators-
(1) Share in India’s GDP and (2) Relative per capita income
The state's share in India’s GDP:
It is calculated by dividing the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of the state by the sum of GSDP of all states. This gives an idea of the relative economic importance of states.
Relative per capita income:
It is calculated as the ratio of the per capita Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) of the state as a percentage of the all-India per capita Net National Product (or Net National Income in some years).
However, the per capita NSDP means that it
does not include remittances
which may be important for states like Kerala, Bihar and UP.
Regional Analysis of Relative Economic Performance of States:
Southern states:
Before 1991
, southern states did not show expectational performance. However,
since the economic liberalisation of 1991
, the southern states have emerged as the leading performers.
In 2023-24
, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu together accounted for approximately 30% of India's GDP.
The per capita income
of all southern states became higher than the national average after 1991.
For instance,
The relative per capita income in Telangana is now 193.6% of the national average.
While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala have per capita incomes 181, 171, and 152.5% of the national average, respectively.
Western states:
Maharashtra
has maintained the highest share of India’s GDP for almost all of the period.
Gujarat’s
share remained at broadly the same levels until 2000-01, before beginning to increase rapidly from 6.4% in 2000-01 to 8.1% in 2022-23.
Both Gujarat and Maharashtra have had per capita incomes exceeding the national average since the 1960s.
By 2023-24,
Gujarat’s per capita income has risen to 160.7% of national average, as compared to 150% for Maharashtra.
In 2022-23, the per capita income of
Goa
was nearly three times the national average. With this, it is
second in terms of per capita income
after Sikkim.
Northern states:
Among the northern states,
Delhi and Haryana
have performed notably well, while
Punjab's
economy has deteriorated after 1991.
Haryana's share of India’s GDP now exceeds that of Punjab, and its relative per capita income has reached 176.8%, compared to Punjab's 106.7% in 2023-24.
Eastern states:
West Bengal
, which held the 3rd-largest share of national GDP at 10.5% in 1960-61, now accounts for only 5.6% in 2023-24.
Its per capita income
was above the national average in 1960-61 at 127.5%, but its relative per capita income declined to 83.7% in 2023-24, falling below the states like Rajasthan and Odisha.
The relative per capita income of undivided
was 70.3% in 1960- 61. It started declining and has been roughly flat at around 33% since 2000-01.
In Bihar, the actual household incomes may be higher as the remittances are not captured here.
Central states:
In the 1960s, undivided
was the largest economic powerhouse in the country, with a share of 14.4% in India’s GDP in 1960-61.
However, the share of UP (bifurcated) in national GDP was
8.4% in 2023-24
MP’s
relative per capita income increased from 60.1% in 2010-11 to 77.4% in 2023-24.
North-eastern states:
In 1980-81,
Sikkim's
per capita income was below the national average. However, its per capita income surged from around 100% of the national average in 2000-01 to
320% in 2023-24
Assam
, which initially had a per capita income slightly above the national average, experienced a decline in its relative per capita income and reached 73.7% in 2023- 24.

**********Supreme Court sets aside criminal proceedings against 30 Army personnel in Nagaland operation
Why in news?
The Supreme Court has closed all proceedings related to an FIR against 30 army personnel accused of a botched operation in Nagaland in 2021.
The SC bench stated that Nagaland, being a state under the
Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958
, requires sanction from the competent authority to prosecute armed forces personnel under Section 6 of the Act.  The two-judge bench, however, said its order would not prevent the Army from taking any disciplinary action against the personnel.
The competent authority, in an order dated February 28, 2023, had denied granting this sanction, leading the court to close the case.
What’s in today’s article?
Background
Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958
Background of the present case
Killing of 13 People in Nagaland
In December 2021, Army para commandos were lying in wait for militants in Nagaland’s Mon district.
The commando team was deployed at a site between Tiru and Oting, about 100km from the Myanmar border.
They apparently mistook the coal mine workers for their targets in the dark and started firing.
They shot and killed six villagers instead, all of them coal mine workers returning home in a van singing songs.
Soon after, a village search party attacked the soldiers,
leading to firing in which seven more civilians died
. A soldier was also killed.
Later, another civilian was killed in Mon, dominated by the Konyak tribe, when security forces repelled a mob attack on an Assam Rifles camp.
With a population of roughly 3 lakhs, the area inhabited by the Konyaks extends into Arunachal Pradesh, with a sizeable population in Myanmar as well.
Known to be one of the fiercest warrior tribes in Nagaland, the Konyaks were the last to give up the practice of head-hunting.
Mon is the only district in Nagaland where separatist group NSCN (IM) has not been able to set up base camps, largely due to resistance from the Konyaks.
Aftermath of killing: Formation of enquiry commission
Following the incident, which caused wide public outrage in Nagaland and the Northeast, the state government had formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the matter.
Separately, the Army initiated an independent Court of Inquiry to investigate the incident.
Findings of SIT
The SIT completed its investigation and, based on its findings, filed a chargesheet in May 2022 at the district and sessions court in Mon.
It indicted all 30 personnel of the 21 Para SF team involved in the shooting.
Need for sanction to prosecute from the Centre
These security personnel were operating in areas which are under AFSPA, 1958.
Hence, there is need for the sanction of prosecution from the Centre for initiating any proceedings against security forces personnel for any actions taken by them while discharging their duties.
Centre denied sanction to prosecute
In February 2023, the competent authority had declined to grant the sanction.
Present case in the Supreme Court
The present case involves two writ petitions filed by the wives of two Indian Army officers, seeking to quash a suo moto FIR registered by the Nagaland Police against army personnel, including their husbands.
Petitions also challenge the findings and recommendations of this SIT.
[AFSPA]
About
It was enacted to bring under control what the government of India considered
disturbed areas
Enacted by Parliament in September 1958, AFSPA was first implemented in the Northeast, and then in Punjab.
Under its provisions, the armed forces have been empowered to open fire; enter and search without warrant, and arrest any person who has committed a cognisable offence.
Prosecution of the officer on duty needs prior permission of the Central Government
Controversial provisions of AFSPA
Section 3
– It empowers the Centre to declare any area as Disturb Area without taking consent of the concerned state.
Section 4
– Accords certain power to an authorised officer which also include power to open fire at any individual even if it results in death.
Under this section, the officer has also been given the power to (a) arrest without a warrant; and (b) seize and search without any warrant any premise.
Section 7
– It mandates prior executive permission from central or state authorities for prosecution of a member of the security forces.
