Why Digitisation is Not Enough to Reform Land Laws
Context
India’s land governance system is deeply entangled in a complex network of legal, institutional, and administrative challenges
that have hampered the country’s economic and social development.
As highlighted in the Economic Survey 2023-24,
these challenges are barriers to achieving multiple developmental goals.
While the 2024 Budget proposed technological solutions
to modernise India’s land administration,
such initiatives do not address the deeply rooted legal and institutional barriers
that hinder effective land governance.
An Analysis of Barriers in Land Governance
Unclear Land Titles and Insecure Tenure
One of the most significant issues in India’s land governance is the
lack of clear and secure land titles.
Ownership of land in India is often ambiguous
due to outdated records, poor maintenance of land registries, and overlapping claims.
This
problem is especially prevalent in rural areas
where the majority of landholdings are informal and not officially registered.
Farmers and landowners cannot confidently invest in long-term improvements on their land,
as they lack formal proof of ownership.
Ambiguous ownership frequently leads to land disputes,
which clog the judicial system.
Fragmented and Conflicting Legal Framework
India’s land governance is subject to a myriad of conflicting laws
that vary across states and regions, adding to the complexity and inefficiency of the system.
These laws regulate land ownership, transfers, leasing, and land use
in ways that are
often contradictory or overlapping.
Several laws impose restrictions on the transfer of land
, especially agricultural land.
In many states,
only certain individuals or groups can purchase agricultural land, and transfers are subject to rigid regulations
that differ from one state to another.
Fragmentation of Land Holdings
Land fragmentation is one of the most pressing challenges in India’s agricultural sector.
Over time, as land is passed down through generations, it is divided into smaller and smaller parcels.
Small landholdings prevent farmers from benefiting from economies of scale,
as they lack the resources to invest in modern machinery, advanced irrigation techniques, or high-quality seeds.
Gender Inequality in Land Ownership
Despite several legal provisions that aim to improve women’s access to land ownership,
gender inequality remains a pervasive issue in India’s land governance.
Women, especially in rural areas, are often denied their rightful share of property
due to social norms, patriarchal traditions, and legal loopholes.
While legal reforms such as the Hindu Succession Act have been introduced to grant women equal inheritance rights,
in practice, women are often pressured to forgo their claims to family property in favour of their male relatives.
Land Use Restrictions and Regulatory Barriers
Many
laws in India impose restrictions on how land can be used
, particularly in the agricultural sector.
These land use regulations are often rigid and outdated
, preventing landowners from converting their land for more economically viable purposes.
For instance, land that is designated for agricultural use cannot easily be converted for industrial or commercial purposes
, even if such a conversion would lead to higher economic returns.
regulations also limit leasing opportunities
, thereby stifling investment in the land.
Proposed Reforms: Digitisation and Its Limitations
To address some of these challenges,
the 2024 Budget proposed several digitisation initiatives, including the digitisation of land records,
the creation of land registries, and the assignment of unique identification numbers to land parcels.
Additionally,
efforts to integrate land records with digital platforms such as Agri Stack have been suggested to streamline land administration.
these reforms could modernise the way India manages its land records, they fall short of addressing the root causes of land-related problems
, which are legal and institutional in nature.
Limitations of Digitisation
The uncertainty surrounding land ownership and insecure property titles are not solely due to the paper-based nature of land records
but stem from conflicting laws and administrative procedures.
For example,
digitising urban land records may not necessarily lead to improved land ownership or access to formal credit
, as long as the underlying legal framework remains convoluted and restrictive.
digitised system cannot overcome the risks associated with land transactions, which remain subject to numerous laws restricting land transfers
, leasing, and use.
The persistence of legal ambiguity, particularly in the context of agricultural land leasing, further undermines the effectiveness of digitization efforts.
The Real Solution to India’s Complex Land Governance System
Legal Recognition of Land Titles
A central component of reform must be the
establishment of a legally recognised and enforceable system of land titles.
involves creating a unified framework that provides a clear and indisputable record of ownership.
current system, in which ownership is often based on possession rather than formal title, needs to be replaced
with one that provides individuals and businesses with secure and transferable property rights.
Guaranteed Tenure Security
Strengthening tenure security is crucial for encouraging investment in land.
Farmers, in particular, need assurance that they will not lose their land to expropriation
or disputes, which will enable them to make long-term investments in agricultural productivity.
Clear property rights are also necessary to give landowners access to formal credit
, as banks are more willing to offer loans when the collateral is secured by legally recognized titles.
Liberalising Land Transfers
Many state laws impose unnecessary restrictions on the sale and purchase of agricultural land,
such as limiting who can buy or sell land and restricting the use of land for non-agricultural purposes.
restrictions hinder the transfer of land to more efficient users
, stifle investment, and discourage land consolidation.
Legal reforms should aim to remove such restrictions
while ensuring that land transfers are transparent, equitable, and subject to fair compensation.
Reforming Land Leasing Laws
In many states, land leasing is either prohibited or heavily regulated.
creates a barrier to the efficient use of land,
as owners who are unable or unwilling to farm their land cannot legally lease it to more capable or interested farmers.
Reforming these leasing laws
to allow for more flexible and transparent leasing arrangements
would not only increase agricultural productivity but also provide a livelihood option for landless farmers
and rural workers.
Simplifying Consolidation Procedures
The legal and administrative barriers to land consolidation need to be removed.
could involve simplifying the process for merging small and fragmented parcels of land into larger, more economically viable holdings.
Legal frameworks should encourage voluntary land consolidation
, offering incentives to landowners who choose to merge their parcels for more productive use.
Supporting Collective Farming Models
Another avenue for land consolidation is through collective farming models,
where multiple small farmers pool their resources and land to achieve economies of scale.
Legal reforms could promote such models by providing clear guidelines for land pooling and collective management,
ensuring that farmers retain their ownership rights while benefiting from joint production.
Conclusion
While digitisation can assist in modernising land administration
, it is only one piece of the puzzle.
Without addressing the complex web of conflicting laws
, regulatory restrictions, and administrative inefficiencies,
India will not be able to fully unlock the potential of its land resources for economic development and social equity.
True progress will only be achieved through a combination of legal reforms and technological advancements,
paving the way for a more inclusive and productive land governance system.

**********How can the Judiciary Discipline Judges?
Why in News?
A Bench of the five senior-most Supreme Court judges headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) expressed serious concern about
objectionable comments made by a Karnataka High Court Justice
(V Srishananda).
What’s in Today’s Article?
Comments Made by the Karnataka HC Judge
Watchdog of the Judges of Constitutional Courts
Previous Instances of Impeachment Proceedings Against the Judges
Judicial Interventions to Discipline Judges
Comments Made by the Karnataka HC Judge:
During a hearing, he had referred to a particular locality of Bengaluru as being in Pakistan. In another hearing, he had made an objectionable comment against a female lawyer.
Though the SC withdrew its intervention after the judge submitted an apology,
even a slight reprimand
from the apex court to a judge of a constitutional court
is uncommon and conveys a powerful message.
The situation also
highlights the constitutional limitations
on how the judiciary can discipline judges.
Watchdog of the Judges of Constitutional Courts:
The Constitution of India [Article 124(4)]:
A judge of the SC (or any HC) can be
removed from office only by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament
supported -
By a majority of the total membership of that House and
By a majority of not less than two-third of the members of the House present and voting
And has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of
proved misbehaviour or incapacity
Significance of the above provision:
It gives a great degree of protection to the judges to ensure that they can
exercise their powers without fear of interference from the executive
Issues with the above provision - Impeachment or nothing:
The impeachment
, which is a political process, is the
only recourse
to dealing with errant judges.
“Proved misbehaviour” or “incapacity” are the
only two grounds for removal of a judge
of the constitutional court.
The level of political consensus
required
to pass an impeachment motion, makes the standard for impeachment very high.
Previous Instances of Impeachment Proceedings Against the Judges:
Only five instances of impeachment proceedings in history:
Against Justice V Ramaswami (SC, 1993),
Justice Soumitra Sen (Calcutta HC, 2011),
Justice J B Pardiwala (Gujarat HC, 2015),
Justice C V Nagarjuna (HC of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, 2017), and
Then CJI Justice Dipak Misra (2018).
Results of these proceedings:
These proceedings were
never successful
. Justice Sen was impeached by Rajya Sabha and subsequently resigned.
Alternatives to impeachment:
Over the years, the SC has created substitute methods of disciplining judges because, under the current legal framework, the alternative to impeachment is to just turn a blind eye.
Judicial Interventions to Discipline Judges:
Judicial actions:
As the court of last resort, the SC’s word is final and binding
. This means that through judicial action, it can send a message to errant judges, even if such a power is not defined in the letter of the law.
For example
, a five-judge Bench of the SC headed by then CJI Jagdish Khehar held Calcutta HC’s C S Karnan guilty of contempt of court, and
sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment in 2017
Karnan retired less than a month after the SC verdict, and was taken into custody to serve his sentence.
This resulted in an uneasy precedent
, with many voicing concerns about one constitutional court disciplining the judges of another.
Transfer policy:
The SC Collegium
, comprising five senior-most judges of the apex court including the CJI, recommends the transfer of HC judges.
Given that the decisions of the Collegium are opaque,
this transfer policy can be deployed as a tool to discipline judges as well.
In 2010
, the then Karnataka HC judge (P D Dinakaran was facing allegations of land grabbing and corruption) was transferred to the Sikkim HC.
The move was
criticised as only “transferring corruption”
rather than dealing with it. However, Justice Dinakaran resigned in 2011.

**********Tackling Air Pollution
Why in news?
On September 25, Delhi's air quality dropped into the ‘
poor
’ category (AQI 200-300) for the first time since mid-June, marking the start of North India’s bad air season.
In response, the Delhi government launched a
21-point Winter Action Plan
to combat pollution, which includes: Drone monitoring of pollution hotspots; Deployment of anti-smog guns; Exploring the possibility of creating artificial rain.
The
Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)
, responsible for implementing the
Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)
in the NCR, is closely monitoring the situation.
What’s in today’s article?
Air Quality Index (AQI)
Why India’s already dangerous air pollution is set to worsen?
Flaws in the steps taken to address the air pollution in India
Way forward
AQI was launched in October 2014 to disseminate information on air quality in an easily understandable form for the general public.
The measurement of air quality is based on eight pollutants, namely,
PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb
The AQI transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number for ease of understanding.
Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)?
CAQM is a statutory body formed under the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, Act 2021.
The commission aims at better coordination, research, identification, and resolution of problems related to air quality in NCR and adjoining areas.
India’s Air Pollution Crisis Set to Worsen Post-Monsoon
With the southwest monsoon season ending, India’s air pollution is expected to deteriorate due to
stagnant air and temperature inversion
, where warm air traps cooler air near the ground, preventing pollutants from dispersing.
This leads to extremely hazardous levels of PM 2.5 and other pollutants.
While smog intensifies in winter, poor air quality is a year-round issue that requires sustained and comprehensive action.
Meteorological conditions, such as temperature inversion and low wind speeds, particularly affect the Indo-Gangetic plain, worsening pollution.
Inequality and Air Pollution
Economic inequality exacerbates the crisis, with wealthier citizens able to afford air purifiers or relocate to cleaner areas, while poorer communities face the full impact of toxic air.
This highlights the issue of equity in access to clean air.
Various Pollution Sources
India’s air pollution crisis stems from multiple, overlapping sources.
Year-round contributors such as biomass burning for cooking, trash-burning, vehicular emissions, and industrial activity combine with episodic events such as farm stubble burning and festival firecrackers
Current strategies
India has adopted several
superficial measures
to combat air pollution, such as
smog towers
water guns
odd-even road sharing
The latest "silver bullet" is
cloud seeding
, a technique that disperses chemicals to induce rainfall, temporarily clearing the air.
These strategies prioritize appearance over addressing the root causes of pollution.
Cloud Seeding: Limited Impact and Ethical Concerns
Cloud seeding offers only a
short-term reprieve
, diverting attention from needed
systemic changes
Its environmental and ethical issues include:
Redistributing rainfall
, potentially depriving other regions and worsening water scarcity.
Chemicals
like
silver iodide
may pose long-term risks to
agriculture and ecosystems
In a country like India, where
water resources
are already strained, cloud seeding risks aggravating
regional disparities
Flaws of Smog Towers
Smog towers, intended to clean surrounding air, are another flawed solution. Their impact is limited to the immediate area, leaving broader pollution issues unaddressed.
Furthermore, the energy consumption needed to operate these towers may contribute to additional emissions, potentially making them counterproductive.
Way Forward
India's focus on
detracts from addressing air pollution at its source.
Instead,
science-based solutions
coordinated, multi-sectoral approach
are required.
Coordination Among Agencies
Tackling air pollution demands collaboration across government bodies overseeing transport, industry, agriculture, and urban planning.
For example, addressing crop stubble burning needs cooperation among farmers, policymakers, and regulators. A unified, year-round, nationwide strategy is essential.
Capacity Building and Critical Thinking
Building capacity among stakeholders, from researchers to policymakers, and fostering critical thinking are crucial for data-driven solutions.
Institutional frameworks must be strengthened, with investments in research and air quality monitoring systems across India, including satellite-based and low-cost sensor networks.
Beyond Tech-Centric Solutions
While technological fixes can help, they often serve vested interests, benefiting wealthier citizens with air purifiers, while leaving poorer communities vulnerable.
The real fight for clean air is political, and quick fixes perpetuate inequalities rather than addressing root causes
Long-Term Commitment
India needs a multi-decadal, multi-sectoral effort grounded in scientific thinking and committed to sustained collaboration to tackle the structural issues behind its air pollution crisis.

**********India grapples with China Shock 2.0
Context:
Global markets are facing a surge in Chinese exports, referred to as "China Shock 2.0," which has intensified trade tensions. Major economies like the US, India, and others are responding with heightened tariffs to counter the influx of Chinese goods.
What’s in today’s article?
China Shock 1.0
China’s increasing share of global export
India – China Trade Relation
In the 2000s, there was a debate on whether China would become a capitalist powerhouse or retain its communist ideology.
US President Bill Clinton supported China’s accession to the WTO,
believing that economic integration would lead to political reform in Beijing and align it with values like economic freedom
Clinton argued that China’s WTO membership would not only increase imports of American products but also foster democratic principles.
However, the years following China’s entry into the WTO became known as the "China Shock".
Cheap Chinese goods, driven by a large, inexpensive labor force, flooded global markets, leading to widespread manufacturing job losses internationally.
This shock disrupted Western economies and had a detrimental impact on Indian manufacturing and trade as well.
Statistics
China’s share in global export market has increased by 1-7% in the last five years. From sub 14%, it has moved beyond 15.5% in last five years.
Between July 2023 and July 2024 the exports of China have increased by $18.8B (6.67%) from $282B to $301B, while imports increased by $14.8B (7.33%) from $201B to $216B.
Hence, it can be said that China's share of global exports has been increasing.
It is now the world's largest exporter and trading nation
Factors driving the renewed wave of goods exports by China
China’s ambition to move up the export value chain to high-tech sectors such as solar equipment, electric vehicles, and semiconductors.
Domestic demand slump, forcing China to export more aggressively.
Other supporting factors include:
China’s supporting industrial policies which revolve around tax incentives, subsidies and greater access to funds.
Increased focus on R&D also forms part of China’s Industrial Policy.
Made in China 2025 strategy
Beijing’s
'Made in China 2025'
strategy is a long-term plan to transform China into a global high-tech manufacturing leader by
2049
Introduced in 2015, this strategy is aimed at:
achieving 70% self-sufficiency in hi-tech industries by 2025,
competing with other manufacturing rivals by 2035, and
transforming the country into a global manufacturing powerhouse by 2049.
This involves promoting advanced sectors such as
electric vehicles, semiconductors
renewable energy
Under this strategy, the government provides subsidies, including low-interest loans and tax breaks, to hi-tech companies.
Impact on India and Other Economies
IMF recently highlighted concerns about
China's external surpluses
, driven by industrial policies aimed at boosting exports amidst weak domestic demand.
The IMF warned that this could lead to
"China Shock 2.0"
, displacing workers and harming industrial activity in other countries.
The rise in exports threatens local industries and global trade stability, escalating international trade tensions.
In order to counter this surge, recently, the US has imposed significant tariff hikes on Chinese imports, aiming to curb the flood of products:
100% duty on electric vehicles (EVs)
50% duty on solar cells
25% duty on steel, aluminum, EV batteries, and certain minerals
China was the top supplier of goods to India in 2023-24, accounting for imports valued at $101 billion, while India exported goods worth $16.65 billion.
India’s imports from China grew at a much faster pace than from the rest of the world.
This dependence grew so much that despite many economic restrictions on Chinese businesses following the Galwan clash in June 2020, imports from China surpassed a record $100 billion in 2023-24.
For
, the impact is already evident, with
rising by nearly
60%
—from
$70 billion in FY19
$101 billion in FY24
, according to official data.
This surge could further strain India's manufacturing sector, trade balance and ultimately hurt India’s ambition to become global power.
Steel Industry Struggles with Chinese Influx
Despite slowing exports,
Chinese steel imports
have surged globally, including in India. Key statistics include:
iron and steel exports
dropped nearly
19% year-on-year in August 2024
29
during April-August 2024-25.
Finished steel imports
from China to India hit a
seven-year high
in the first five months of FY24-25.
India’s overall
finished steel imports
reached a
six-year high
3.7 million metric tons
between April and August 2024.
The surge in Chinese steel is eroding profits and threatening the stability of steel industries globally, particularly in Europe and India.
China’s dominance in electronics
mobile phone exports
have surged over the past two years, driven by investments from global tech companies like
Apple
, which has expanded manufacturing in the country.
India’s reliance on Chinese imports
for electronic components remains largely unchanged.
, India imported:
Over
$12 billion
worth of electronic components from
$6 billion
Hong Kong
, together accounting for more than half of India’s total electronic component imports.
Despite growth in
electronics manufacturing
, India's dependence on China persists.
Electronic components
import, valued at
$34.4 billion
, were the
fifth-largest commodity
, following
crude oil, gold, petroleum products
coal
, according to Ministry of Commerce data.
Strategy employed by India
India is utilising both options:
imposing
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties
, and;
implementing quality control orders (QCO) to check imports of cheap items from China.
New Delhi is also considering collaborating with other Western countries to meet the challenge of Chinese hi-tech products capturing a lion’s share of the global market.
Counter response by China - Blocking India’s access to solar equipment
The Economic Survey 2023-24 warned that in response to India’s anti-dumping probe against Chinese entities, China has been quietly blocking India’s access to solar equipment.
India aims to achieve
500 GW
of renewable energy capacity by
2030
80%
of India's solar cells and modules still come from
, which dominates the global solar supply chain.
