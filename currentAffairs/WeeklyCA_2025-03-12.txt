Supreme Court to Hear GM Mustard Approval Challenges
March 7, 2025
The Supreme Court of India is set to hear challenges regarding the commercial cultivation of genetically modified (GM) mustard. The hearing is scheduled for April 15, 2025. This follows a split verdict on the Centre’s 2022 approval for the environmental release of
GM mustard
. The court has instructed all parties to submit their written arguments promptly.
What Are Genetically Modified Crops?
Genetically modified crops are plants with altered genes. This modification often involves inserting genetic material from different organisms. The goal is to enhance traits such as yield, disease resistance, and nutritional value. In India, only
Bt cotton
was previously approved for commercial cultivation. The
Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee
(GEAC) has now recommended GM mustard for similar use.
About GM Mustard
Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11) is the first indigenously developed GM mustard in India.
It is a hybrid created by crossing the Indian mustard variety ‘Varuna’ with East European ‘Early Heera-2’.
DMH-11 incorporates two alien genes, ‘barnase’ and ‘barstar’, from the bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens.
This genetic modification allows for the production of high-yielding mustard hybrids. DMH-11 has demonstrated a yield increase of approximately 28% over the national average and 37% over local checks.
Role of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)
The GEAC operates under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
It evaluates the environmental impacts of using hazardous microorganisms and genetically engineered organisms.
The committee reviews proposals for the release of GM organisms and oversees experimental field trials.
Chaired by a senior official from the ministry, the GEAC comprises 24 members and convenes monthly to assess applications.
Legal Context and Public Concerns
The Supreme Court’s involvement comes amid growing public concern regarding GM crops. Activists and NGOs are advocating for a moratorium on the release of any GMOs until a comprehensive bio-safety protocol is established. They argue for transparency and independent assessments of the potential risks associated with GM crops. The court previously directed that the status quo should be maintained on the GEAC’s decision regarding GM mustard.
