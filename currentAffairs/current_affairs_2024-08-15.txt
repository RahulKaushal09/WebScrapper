Mains level:
Suggestions from the Kothari Commission;
Why in the News?
Public service doesn’t have exclusive rights to serve the nation, nor does it offer any special opportunities for doing so.
Present Status of Civil Services in India
Reputation and Credibility:
Recent controversies, such as the
case of IAS probationer Puja Khedkar,
who has allegedly misused quotas and provided false documentation shadow over the credibility of UPSC.
High Aspirations and Struggles:
The civil service job is a
highly demandable career
in India. It is often viewed as a
prestigious and stable option
which leads to a competitive environment where many aspirants repeatedly attempt the UPSC exams leading to
mental health struggles and societal pressure.
Coaching Industry Influence:
The expansive coaching industry thrives on the aspirations of civil service candidates by capitalizing on the high failure rates and the desperation of aspirants.
About the Kothari Commission:
The Kothari Commission, officially known as the
Education Commission of 1964-66
, was established by the Government of India to
comprehensively evaluate the educational system and recommend reforms.
It was chaired by
Dr. D. S. Kothari.
The Commission aimed to align education with
national development goals and address various shortcomings in the existing system.
Its report, titled
“Education and National Development,”
was submitted on June 29, 1966.
Suggestions from the Kothari Commission:
The Kothari Commission’s recommendations, which aimed to reform education and public service, can provide a framework for addressing the current challenges in the civil services:
Age Limit Adjustments:
The government should reduce the upper age
limit for candidates from around 34-35 years to 25 years,
with allowances for special categories which could help mitigate the
prolonged pursuit of civil services
reduce the burden on young aspirants.
Limiting Attempts:
Restricting the number of attempts to
three
with an additional attempt for special categories which could help
streamline the process and discourage the excessive commercialization of coaching services
that exploit aspirants’ ambitions.
Broadened Perspectives on Service:
Encouraging young people to view various professions as valid forms of national service rather than solely focusing on government positions.
Way forward:
Reforming Recruitment and Training Processes
: To enhance credibility and transparency in civil services recruitment, the UPSC and related bodies could implement stricter verification processes for candidates’ credentials, including quotas and documentation.
Diversifying Career Awareness and Opportunities
: The government, along with educational institutions like CBSE can promote awareness of diverse career paths beyond civil services, emphasizing the value of contributing to the nation through various professions.
Mains PYQ:
Initially Civil Services in India were designed to achieve the goals of neutrality and effectiveness, which seems to be lacking in the present context. Do you agree with the view that drastic reforms are required in Civil Services. Comment

**********Freedom from dependence, a new era in health care
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges in the Indian healthcare system;
Why in the News?
India’s healthcare since globalization has improved greatly, and is globally recognized due to skilled professionals, effective policies, and strong institutions which draw patients from over 147 countries.
Economic implications of being a preferred Medical Destination:
Foreign Exchange Savings:
saves billions in foreign exchange as fewer Indians
need to travel abroad for advanced medical treatments.
Revenue Generation:
The influx of international patients
generates over $9 billion annually,
contributing to economic growth.
Job Creation:
The medical tourism sector
creates employment opportunities in healthcare, hospitality, transportation, and pharmaceuticals.
Cost-Effective Treatments:
India’s affordable yet high-quality medical services attract patients globally, further boosting the economy.
What are the challenges?
Shortage of Healthcare Professionals
Current Shortage:
India is estimated to be
short of around 600,000 doctors,
leading to a doctor-patient ratio of approximately
0.7 doctors per 1,000 people,
which is significantly lower than the
World Health Organization’s
recommended ratio of
1 doctor per 1,000 people.
Future Demand:
By 2030, the
demand for healthcare professionals in India is expected to double,
driven by an
ageing population and the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases.
Inadequate Public Healthcare Spending
Low Expenditure:
As of
2021-22,
India’s public healthcare expenditure stood at
2.1% of GDP,
lower than that of many developed countries,
For instance, countries like
Japan and France spend about 10% of their GDP on healthcare,
while the
United States spends 16.9%.
Comparison with Neighbors:
Even neighbouring countries like
Bangladesh and Pakistan allocate over 3% of their GDP to public healthcare.
Unequal Access to Healthcare
Urban-Rural Disparity:
There is a stark disparity in healthcare access between urban and rural areas. Rural regions often
lack basic healthcare facilities, leading to limited access to quality services for a significant portion of the population.
Healthcare Infrastructure:
India’s healthcare infrastructure is inadequate to meet the growing demands of its population. For instance, India has one of the
lowest per capita bed counts
in the world, with only about
0.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people,
compared to the
OECD average of 4.7 beds per 1,000 people.
High Out-of-Pocket Expenditure
Financial Burden:
Approximately
75% of healthcare expenditure in India is borne out-of-pocket
by individuals and families.
Need for a Strong Vision (Way forward)
“Heal in India” Initiative:
The Prime Minister’s vision of
emphasizes positioning
India as a global healthcare leader.
This initiative is not merely a slogan but a strategic approach to enhance India’s reputation as a preferred medical destination.
Youth Engagement:
Inspiring the
youth to pursue careers in healthcare
is crucial for sustaining growth in this sector. By encouraging
innovation and entrepreneurship among young Indians
, the country can ensure a robust healthcare system.
Investment in Public Healthcare:
Increase public
healthcare spending to improve infrastructure, especially in rural areas, and
bridge the urban-rural disparity.
Focus on Medical Device Manufacturing:
Promote domestic
production of medical devices under the “Make in India”
initiative to reduce dependency on imports.
Mains PYQ:
Appropriate local community-level healthcare intervention is a prerequisite to achieve ‘Health for All’ in India. Explain.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Captagon Drug
Why in the News?
Captagon, the “
poor man’s cocaine
,” has become increasingly popular among young adults in the Middle East and North Africa.
What is the Drug Captagon?
Captagon is a
synthetic drug
that was originally
developed in Germany
in the 1960s and 1970s.
It was initially created as a
pharmaceutical treatment for attention deficit disorders
, narcolepsy, and sometimes depression.
The primary active ingredient in Captagon is
fenethylline
, a compound that, once ingested, is metabolized into two powerful stimulants:
amphetamine
theophylline
These substances
stimulate the central nervous system
, leading to increased alertness, reduced fatigue, and a sense of euphoria.
How Addictive is Captagon?
highly addictive
due to its powerful effects on the brain and body.
As a
psychostimulant
, Captagon significantly impacts the central nervous system, leading to a range of effects that can make it very difficult for users to stop taking the drug once they start.
It is also reportedly
used by
fighters in conflict zones
to enhance their endurance and suppress fatigue.
The primary effects of Captagon include:
Euphoria
: Users often experience an intense feeling of happiness or well-being.
Increased Wakefulness
: The drug reduces the need for sleep, keeping users awake and alert for extended periods.
Enhanced Physical and Mental Performance
: Users may feel stronger, more focused, and more capable of performing both physically and mentally demanding tasks.
However, the
heavy use of Captagon
comes with serious risks such as cognitive impairment, cardiovascular issues, and risk of addiction.
Where is Captagon Made?
In recent years,
Syria
“narco state” of Middle East
has emerged as the
largest producer
of Captagon.
Its
production increased after 2011 Arab Spring
protests, which led to civil unrest and conflict in the region.

**********Extremophile bacteria have learnt to survive microwaves
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Researchers have isolated extremophile bacteria from harsh environments like volcanic vents, permafrost, acid mines, deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and lakes beneath polar ice caps.
What are Extremophiles?
Extremophiles are
microorganisms
that
thrive in extreme environmental conditions
where other life forms typically cannot survive.
For example:
Volcanic vents, Permafrost, Acid mines, Deep-sea hydrothermal vents, dark lakes
buried beneath
polar ice caps, on the exteriors of spacecraft, around nuclear waste storage sites.
Adaptation and Evolution
Extremophiles have developed
unique biological and biochemical processes
over millions of years to adapt to diverse habitats.
Unlike more complex life forms, which have one set of proteins,
extremophiles have multiple sets of proteins
, each adapted to specific environmental conditions.
These proteins are ‘
activated’ based on the surrounding environment
, enabling survival during extreme conditions like high temperatures, lack of water, or high acidity.
Significance
: Some scientists believe that
life on Earth may have begun as an extremophile
in extreme environmental niches before spreading and adapting to more temperate ecosystems.
About the ‘Earth Microbiome Project’
It is a
global initiative
aimed at
mapping, organising, and understanding
diversity of microbial life
across different environmental niches on Earth.
The project was
founded in 2010.
Objective:
To
sequence 200,000 genetic samples
from diverse environments.
assemble 500,000 microbial genomes
, creating a
comprehensive map of microbial diversity on Earth.
The project is part of broader efforts to understand the microbial world, which is still in its infancy.
It is related to other significant projects like the ‘
Earth Biogenome Project
,’ which
aims to sequence the genomes of all eukaryotic organisms
on the planet.
Understanding microbial diversity has numerous biological and industrial applications, such as developing
new enzymes for molecular biology or finding
new ways to adapt organisms to challenging environments.
