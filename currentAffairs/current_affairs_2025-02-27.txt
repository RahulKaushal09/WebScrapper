**********Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
The European Union recently acknowledged India’s “specific concerns” about implementing the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).
About Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM):
It is a
European Union (EU) tariff on carbon-intensive products.
It is a new EU instrument
for preventing carbon leakage,
that is, the shifting of the production of goods to non-EU countries where there is a lower or no carbon cost associated with their production.
Purpose:
To put a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods that are entering the EU and to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries
By confirming that a price has been paid for the embedded carbon emissions generated in the production of certain goods imported into the EU, the CBAM will
ensure the carbon price of imports is equivalent to the carbon price of domestic production
, and that the EU's climate objectives are not undermined.
Imports
mean any imports to the EU from outside the EU,
including e.g., imports of goods ordered online and imports of gifts.
The CBAM is designed to be
compatible with WTO rules.
Carbon Certificates:
If implemented as planned,
EU importers
have to buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price
that would have been paid in the EU if the goods had been produced locally.
The price of the certificates would be
calculated according to the auction prices in the EU carbon credit market.
The number of certificates required would be defined yearly by the quantity of goods and the embedded emissions in those goods imported into the EU.
EU importers will declare the emissions embedded
in their imports and
surrender the corresponding number of certificates
each year.
If importers can prove
carbon price has already been paid
during the production of the imported goods, the
corresponding amount can be deducted.
Companies in countries with a domestic carbon pricing regime equivalent to the EU’s will be able to export to the EU without buying CBAM certificates.
Implementation Timeline:
apply in its definitive regime from 2026,
while the current transitional phase lasts between 2023 and 2025.
commenced
transitional phase as of 1 October 2023.
Only reporting obligations
arise
during the transitional period,
and financial obligations apply from 2026.
Coverage
: CBAM will
initially cover
several specific products in some of the most
carbon-intensive sectors
at risk of "carbon leakage":
iron and steel
(including some downstream products such as nuts and bolts),
cement, fertilizers, aluminium, electricity, and hydrogen.

**********Mount Fentale
Mount Fentale volcano in Ethiopia is spewing unusually large volumes of methane from its crater, according to satellite measurements of the potent greenhouse gas.
About Mount Fentale:
It is a
stratovolcano
located in Awash National Park in the
Oromia Region, Ethiopia.
It rises approximately 600 m from the floor of the Rift Valley, and the lavas of the volcano cover an oval area of approximately 100 sq km.
An
elliptical caldera
, approximately
6 km in diameter, dominates the upper portion
of the volcano.
Recent Earthquake Activity:
A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit under Fentale volcano on 14 February 2025.
It is the strongest earthquake to strike Ethiopia since 1989.
What is a Stratovolcano?
The
tall, steep, and cone-shaped
type of volcano.
Unlike flat shield volcanoes like in Hawaii, they have
higher peaks.
At the peak,
stratovolcanoes
usually have a small crater.
Stratovolcanoes build up on height by layering lava, ash, and tephra. By definition, they have
alternating layers of pyroclastics and lava.
When ash falls or
lava flows
, it solidifies and
makes a narrower cone.
They comprise the
largest percentage (~60%) of the Earth's individual volcanoes.
They are usually about half lava and half pyroclastic material, and the layering of these products gives them their
other common name of composite volcanoes.

**********What is Petrification?
Geologists and forest officials recently unearthed a rare and well-preserved petrified fossil at Rajmahal Hills near Barmasia village in Pakur district, Jharkhand.
About Petrification:
Petrification (petros means stone) occurs when the
organic matter
is completely
replaced by minerals
and the
fossil is turned to stone.
This generally occurs
by filling the pores of the tissue
and inter-
and intracellular spaces with minerals
, then
dissolving the organic matter
replacing it with minerals.
This method r
eproduces the original tissue
in every This
kind of fossilization
occurs in both hard and soft tissues.
This typically occurs when the material is buried under sediment and exposed to mineral-rich water over long periods.
This process is involved in many forms of fossilization and leaves behind many stunning and
beautifully preserved fossils.
An
example
of this kind of fossilization is
petrified wood.

**********Svalbard Global Seed Vault
Recently, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault received more than 14,000 new seed samples.
About Svalbard Global Seed Vault:
It is the largest backup facility for the
world’s crop diversity.
Svalbard is the
Norwegian archipelago
half way between the Northern pole and Mainland Norway.
The Seed Vault's objective is to
safeguard as much of the world’s unique crop genetic
material as possible while also avoiding unnecessary duplication.
It offers
free-of-charge, long-term storage
duplicates from international, national and regional gene banks and institutions.
The ownership of the seeds
remains with the depositing gene bank
. In the Seed Vault they are stored under so called black box conditions, meaning that only the
institution that deposited the seeds
has access
and is allowed to withdraw them.
It was set deep inside a mountain to withstand disasters from nuclear war to global warming,
in 2008
as a backup for the world’s gene banks that store the genetic code for thousands of plant species.
It has the capacity to store 4.5 million varieties of crops.
The facility serves a humanitarian purpose and is part of the international system for conserving plant genetic diversity guided by the
UN organisation for Food and Agriculture (FAO).

**********Kundi Water Harvest System
The Kundi traditional Water Harvest System is an excellent example of how local knowledge and architectural ingenuity can address environmental challenges in water scarce region.
About Kundi Water Harvest System:
The kundi (also known as a kund) is a
traditional rainwater harvesting system
that is predominantly found in desert regions
in Rajasthan, India.
This system is designed to capture and store rainwater, which is crucial in arid and semi-arid areas where water is scarce and rainfall is unpredictable.
Structure:
It consists of a
deep, circular or rectangular pit
that is either dug into the ground or constructed above ground.
It is usually
lined with stones, bricks, or other materials
to reinforce the structure and prevent seepage.
The pit is often
covered with a lid or stone slab
to prevent contamination from debris and to reduce evaporation.
Rainwater is collected through channels or from rooftops, and then funneled into the kundi, where it is stored for use during the dry season.
Significance:
It serves as an efficient method of water conservation, particularly in places where surface water is limited, and access to groundwater is difficult.
It helps to ensure that water is available for drinking, irrigation, and other domestic purposes when rainfall is scarce.

**********Cali Fund
Recently, the ‘Cali Fund’ was launched at the resumed 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Rome.
About Cali Fund:
It is a new international fund has been created to
help protect biodiversity.
It will
collect money from private companies
. These companies use genetic data from nature in their businesses.
The Cali Fund will receive money from businesses that rely on
Digital Sequence Information
(DSI).
DSI includes genetic data from plants, animals, and microorganisms. Industries like pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, agriculture, and biotechnology use DSI to develop products.
Under this new system, they will now have to contribute a
part of their revenue to support biodiversity efforts.
The money collected will be used in several ways.
It will support
biodiversity conservation projects
help developing countries
implement their biodiversity action plans, and fund scientific research to improve how genetic data is stored and used.
At least 50 per cent of its resources will go to
indigenous peoples and local communities
, recognising their crucial role in protecting nature.
This is the first time that a global biodiversity fund under the UN will receive direct contributions from businesses.
This fund will be managed by the
United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) and
United Nations Environment Programme
Significance:
This marks an important step in ensuring
industries benefiting
biodiversity also contribute to its conservation.
It is seen as a key step towards
meeting the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF)
goal of stopping and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030.

**********Why PwDs Are Worried About Digital Personal Data Protection Rules
Why in the News?
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is looking to wrap up public consultations on the draft Rules for the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 by March 5.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Controversial Provisions of DPDP Act (Section 9(1), Concerns, Govt’s Response, Way Forward, etc.)
Introduction:
is finalizing public consultations on the
Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023
and its draft rules.
However, disability rights activists have raised
serious concerns
over a specific provision in
, which
clubs adult Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) with children
and mandates that their
legal guardians provide consent
for any digital personal data processing.
Activists argue that this
undermines the autonomy
of PwDs and reflects
a flawed understanding of guardianship laws
Understanding the Controversial Provision – Section 9(1):
The DPDP Act requires
data fiduciaries (organizations processing data)
to obtain
verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian
before processing personal data of a
child or a PwD with a lawful guardian
definition of PwDs
in this provision
lumps all individuals with disabilities together
, assuming that those with guardians are
incapable of making legally binding decisions
Rule 10(2)
require verification that the guardian was
appointed by a court or designated authority
under Indian guardianship laws.
While the rule provides
detailed explanations for child consent
, it
lacks clarity on how guardianship-based consent would apply to PwDs
, leading to confusion.
Reasons Behind PwDs and Activists Concerns:
Undermining Autonomy of PwDs
The provision assumes that
all PwDs with guardians lack decision-making abilities
, ignoring the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016
promotes supported decision-making instead of absolute guardianship
Many PwDs function independently with
limited legal support
but may still have a legal guardian for specific purposes.
Legal Confusion Between RPWD Act and NT Act
PwDs are governed by two laws:
RPWD Act, 2016
provides for
limited guardianship
, allowing the PwD to
exercise rights with support
National Trust (NT) Act, 1999
allows
full guardianship
for individuals with
autism, cerebral palsy, or intellectual disabilities
However, the DPDP Act
does not differentiate between these categories
, applying a
blanket rule
for all PwDs with guardians.
Practical Challenges in Implementation
There is
no clear guideline
on how digital platforms should obtain
guardian consent for PwDs
If a guardian refuses consent, the PwD may
lose access to essential services
, such as
online banking, e-commerce, or healthcare platforms
Activists highlight
gender-based discrimination
, where
women with disabilities may be denied access to digital platforms
without guardian approval.
Risk to Digital Rights of PwDs:
Disability rights groups argue that the DPDP Act
compromises digital rights
by making
guardian consent mandatory for accessing online services
. This could lead to:
Exclusion from digital platforms
like
banking, government schemes, e-commerce, and education portals
Increased control of guardians over PwDs’ choices
, restricting their ability to make personal decisions.
Legal ambiguity for guardians
, who may face
penalties
under the DPDP Act if their consent leads to
data misuse
survey by PACTA and Saksham Disability
found that
27.4% of PwDs had legal guardians
, yet most of them
managed their affairs independently
, contradicting the assumptions made by the DPDP Act.
Government's Response and the Way Forward:
The government argues that
limiting the definition of PwDs covered under Section 9(1)
helps address concerns.
However, disability activists argue that this
further complicates the issue
by adding
unclear definitions
Recommended changes by disability rights groups include:
Amending Section 9(1) to align with the RPWD Act, 2016
, ensuring PwDs have
decision-making autonomy
Providing clear guidelines
on how data fiduciaries should handle
guardian-based consent for PwDs
Ensuring that digital accessibility barriers are addressed
, as many platforms are still not user-friendly for PwDs.
Conclusion:
The DPDP Act, 2023, aims to
regulate digital personal data
while protecting user rights. However, its
rigid guardianship rules
threaten the
digital autonomy of PwDs
, potentially excluding them from
online services and decision-making processes
balanced approach
, incorporating
input from disability rights groups
, is necessary to ensure
data protection laws
do not inadvertently
violate the rights of PwDs

**********Language Policy in India - The Three-Language Formula and Its Challenges
Context:
Tamil Nadu's opposition
to the three-language formula has caused friction with the Centre. The state has adhered to a
two-language policy
for decades and remains firm in its stance.
The three-language policy
has had
a mixed record in implementation
across India.
The Language Debate in India:
Historical perspective:
Post-Independence
, language policies have remained controversial.
Language has been perceived as
a medium of instruction
rather than a cognitive tool.
Colonial influence
shaped the education system’s focus on
instruction rather than exploration.
Constituent assembly and language policy:
The issue of a national language
was debated extensively during Constitution drafting.
Hindi’s adoption
as an official language was
fraught with complexities
due to its multiple varieties.
English retained prominence
, despite expectations of its gradual decline.
Evolution of the Three-Language Formula:
The three-language formula:
It is a language learning policy introduced in the
1968 National Policy on Education.
It mandated that students across India
learn three languages:
their regional language (mother tongue), Hindi, and English.
Hindi-speaking states
must study a modern Indian language (preferably from the south) instead of Hindi as their third language.
NEP 2020 and the three-language formula:
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
has retained the three-language formula albeit with a key difference that it doesn't impose any language on any State.
It specifies that the languages to be learnt will be the
choice of States, regions and the students
, so long as at least two of the three languages are native to India.
Implementation challenges across India:
In the Hindi-speaking states,
the third language rarely includes contemporary languages from other Indian states.
Private schools in northern states
do not prioritize regional languages like Tamil or Punjabi.
Political concerns over language education
have remained divisive and often counterproductive.
Role played by the CABE:
The Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE), a remarkable forum that had served India since the 1920s, has played a crucial role in shaping language policies.
CABE helped
navigate federal governance challenges
in education but has been
inactive in recent years
The Real Issue - Language Standards in Education:
Declining teaching standards:
Science and mathematics
have been
dominated
by coaching institutions, while language teaching remains neglected.
English is now compulsory
in many government schools, but proficiency remains low.
Teachers' limited command
over English affects learning outcomes, as seen in Andhra Pradesh’s transition to English-medium education.
Impact on regional languages and reading habits:
Not just English, the standards of teaching in Hindi are no better.
Hindi and other regional languages are being treated as
cultural artifacts rather than active learning tools.
The decline in reading habits
signifies deeper issues in language education.
Schools fail to cultivate habitual readers
, undermining long-term language proficiency.
Conclusion:
over language education in India remains
unresolved
. Tamil Nadu’s steadfast opposition to the three-language formula reflects
deeper concerns
linguistic identity and federal policies
Improving language teaching standards is crucial for meaningful educational reform rather than focusing solely on policy formulas.

Editorial Analysis
**********The Bigger Tragedy is the Railways and Its Systemic Inertia
Context
recent stampede at New Delhi railway station
on February 15 serves as
a grim reminder of the persistent inadequacies in passenger safety
and crowd management within Indian Railways.
Despite the rapid modernisation of railway infrastructure and an ever-expanding network,
the core issue of ensuring basic safety remains alarmingly overlooked.
tragedy underscores deeper systemic failures;
failures not rooted in resource constraints but in institutional inertia, mismanagement, and a lack of accountability.
The Primary Cause of New Delhi Stampede: Systemic Lapses and Negligence
Systematic Lapses
fundamental principle of crowd control is to ensure smooth and unidirectional movement
, eliminate bottlenecks, and deploy sufficient security personnel.
However,
these measures were evidently ignored
at New Delhi railway station.
sudden announcement of a special unreserved train to Prayagraj on platform 12,
despite an existing massive crowd on platform 14,
led to confusion and panic.
This decision, though not officially categorised as a platform change
, created an uncontrolled surge of movement, resulting in chaos and ultimately, disaster.
Failure to Implement Proactive Measures
Preliminary reports suggest that
the control room, despite having access to CCTV surveillance, failed to take proactive measures
such as stopping escalators to prevent congestion.
negligence highlights an alarming lack of situational awareness
and preparedness among railway authorities.
inadequate deployment of Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel
and poor barricading further exacerbated the situation, exposing passengers to grave risks.
claim that authorities were caught off-guard by the influx of ticket sales is implausible,
as festival seasons have historically drawn large crowds, necessitating robust crowd management strategies.
Broader Disconcerting Aspects of the Tragedy
Half-Truths and Shifting Blame
In the aftermath of the tragedy,
Indian Railways has attempted to shift responsibility onto passengers,
citing their numbers, last-minute ticket purchases, and failure to heed announcements.
such defences fail to acknowledge
that mass gatherings
during religious events like the Kumbh Mela
are not unprecedented.
Indian Railways itself had announced
the movement of
over 15 lakh passengers across 350 trains to Prayagraj in February,
making it evident that authorities had prior knowledge of the expected footfall.
failure to replicate effective crowd management strategies
, such as those successfully implemented during Chhath Puja,
further questions the Railways' preparedness.
crisis response after the tragedy
, including the abrupt deployment of additional security personnel, creation of holding areas, and suspension of platform ticket sales,
indicates that these measures were always within reach
but were simply neglected.
Had these protocols been in place beforehand, the stampede could have been prevented.
Contradictory Statements and Lack of Accountability
One of the most disconcerting aspects of this tragedy is the
Railways’ inconsistent and insensitive response.
Official
narratives have shifted from outright denial to ambiguous explanations,
culminating in ex gratia payments to victims' families before the actual death toll was confirmed.
Such actions reflect a lack of empathy and transparency,
exacerbating public distrust in railway authorities.
Attempt to Attribute the Stampede to Fake News
Attempts to attribute the
stampede to ‘fake news’ and conspiracies rather than acknowledging lapses in planning mirror a larger pattern
within Indian Railways—where every mishap is prematurely blamed on sabotage rather than internal failures.
Railways' history is replete with similar disasters,
such as the Elphinstone Road station stampede in Mumbai (2017) and the Allahabad station stampede during the 2013 Kumbh Mela.
recurrence of such incidents suggests that lessons from past tragedies have not been internalised,
raising serious concerns about institutional learning and reform.
Flawed Inquiry Process
Railways' decision to conduct a ‘high-level’ inquiry
through its own senior executives
raises fundamental concerns
about impartiality.
Unlike train accidents, which are independently investigated by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS),
the current probe is being led by railway officials who may themselves be accountable for lapses.
This self-regulation undermines public confidence and hinders the pursuit of justice.
The Way Forward: Need for Reform
truly transparent and independent investigation
, whether by the CRS or another external agency,
would have signalled the Railways’ commitment to accountability.
the decision to oversee its own inquiry
reinforces the perception that the
institution is resistant to genuine reform.
Until Indian Railways confronts its entrenched bureaucratic inertia and prioritises passenger safety over institutional complacency
, such tragedies will continue to be dismissed as unfortunate inevitabilities rather than preventable failures.
Conclusion
The New Delhi railway station stampede is not an isolated incident
but a symptom of a deeper malaise within Indian Railways.
failure to implement basic crowd control measures, the reluctance to accept responsibility,
and the flawed investigation process
all point to a system in urgent need of reform.
Moving forward, Indian Railways must abandon its reactive approach to crises and proactively address safety concerns
through improved planning, greater accountability, and independent oversight.

**********A Leap Backward for Maternity Entitlements
Context
In recent years,
several Indian states have prioritised direct cash transfers to women
as a form of social security.
However,
one of the most vulnerable groups, pregnant women, continues to be deprived of their legal right
to maternity benefits.
While the
National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013 mandates a minimum financial aid of ₹6,000 per child
, the implementation of this provision has been inadequate.
Therefore,
it is imperative to explore the shortcomings of maternity benefit schemes in India
, the challenges in their implementation, and the need for policy reform.
The Undermining of the NFSA Mandate
NFSA explicitly states that all pregnant women
, except those in the formal sector,
are entitled to maternity benefits.
Adjusted for inflation,
this amount should be at least ₹12,000 today
, yet even the
original ₹6,000 has not been fully implemented.
Instead, the
central government introduced the PM Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), which limits benefits to ₹5,000
for the first child and recently
extended coverage to a second child only if it is a girl.
This
restriction violates the universal nature of maternity entitlements
outlined in the NFSA and significantly weakens the program’s potential impact.
Shortcomings of PMMVY
Implementation Failures and Lack of Transparency
The PMMVY has been marred by
serious implementation challenges
. Many eligible women are unable to access even the reduced benefits due to bureaucratic hurdles and digital inefficiencies.
Ministry of Women and Child Development provides little information
on the program’s performance, undermining transparency.
Although Right to Information (RTI) queries have provided some insight,
they reveal a dismal picture.
Effective coverage of the PMMVY,
defined as the proportion of pregnant women receiving at least one instalment,
peaked at only 36% in 2019-20
and plummeted to just 9% in 2023-24.
primary reason for this decline appears to be disruptions
caused by software changes and overly complex implementation processes.
Structural Barriers and Digital Exclusion
One of the significant hurdles in accessing PMMVY benefits is the
over-reliance on Aadhaar-based payments and digital verification.
Many women,
particularly those from marginalised backgrounds,
struggle to navigate these systems, leading to their exclusion.
Technical glitches and procedural complications have further discouraged participation.
Instead of simplifying access,
the government has introduced additional barriers, raising concerns
about whether the administrative inefficiencies are deliberate cost-cutting measures rather than mere oversight.

a frontrunner in social welfare programs
, particularly in maternal and child healthcare.
The state’s maternity benefit scheme
, originally introduced in 1987,
has undergone several enhancements over the years.
Under its current version,
pregnant women receive financial assistance of ₹18,000 per child
, a significantly higher amount than the ₹5,000 provided under the PMMVY.
benefits are disbursed in instalments to ensure continuous support
throughout pregnancy and after childbirth.
Additionally,
Tamil Nadu’s program has been designed with a strong emphasis on accessibility
and ease of implementation.
state government has ensured that documentation requirements are minimal,
reducing bureaucratic hurdles.
As a result,
Tamil Nadu achieved 84% coverage of all births in 2023-24,
a stark contrast to the PMMVY’s nationwide coverage of less than 10%.
Odisha: Expanding Benefits with Political Commitment
Odisha’s Mamata Scheme
, launched in 2009, is another example of a
well-functioning maternity benefit program.
Unlike the PMMVY, which restricts benefits to only the first child (with a recent conditional extension to second-child girls),
Odisha’s program provides ₹10,000 per child, covering a broader base of beneficiaries.
Ahead of the 2024 general election,
the state government decided to double this amount
, demonstrating a clear political commitment to maternal welfare.
Odisha’s Economic Survey data suggests that the Mamata Scheme achieved 64% coverage of all births in 2021-22,
significantly higher than the PMMVY’s national figures.
One reason for this success is the
state government’s focus on simplified procedures and direct beneficiary outreach.
Unlike the PMMVY, which has suffered from digital payment failures and bureaucratic inefficiencies,
Odisha’s scheme ensures that funds reach eligible women in a timely manner.
Expand Coverage:
The PMMVY should extend benefits beyond just the first child, as seen in Odisha and Tamil Nadu, to provide comprehensive support for maternal health.
Increase Benefit Amounts
The financial support offered by the PMMVY is insufficient to meet basic nutritional and healthcare needs during pregnancy.
central government should follow Tamil Nadu’s model
and increase benefits in line with inflation.
Simplify Implementation
The PMMVY is plagued by
digital verification failures and bureaucratic red tape.
Tamil Nadu and Odisha have shown that
streamlined procedures
lead to higher coverage and better accessibility.
Ensure Political Commitment
The PMMVY has remained stagnant since its launch in 2017, whereas Tamil Nadu and Odisha have actively improved their schemes over time.
A commitment to
periodic evaluation
and enhancement of maternity benefits is essential.
The Way Forward: The Need for Policy Reform
The stark contrast between state-level programs and the PMMVY highlights
the urgent need for policy reform at the national level.
The central government
must revamp the maternity benefit system to align with the NFSA’s original intent.
Key reforms should include:
Universal Coverage:
Removing restrictions on the number of children covered under the scheme.
Adequate Financial Support:
Increasing the maternity benefit to at least ₹12,000 and indexing it to inflation.
Simplified Access:
Reducing bureaucratic hurdles and eliminating excessive digital dependencies that exclude the most vulnerable women.
Transparency and Accountability:
Ensuring proactive disclosure of data on fund allocations and disbursement rates to allow public scrutiny.
Conclusion
While India offers 26 weeks of paid maternity leave in the formal sector, women in the unorganised sector receive a meagre ₹5,000,
if they manage to overcome the hurdles of the PMMVY.
The program’s failures highlight a deeper issue:
a lack of political will to support maternal and child health comprehensively.
A well-designed and adequately funded maternity benefit program
would not only uphold the rights of pregnant women but also
contribute to broader social and economic benefits.
The time has come for the government to acknowledge the shortcomings of the PMMVY
and ensure that maternity entitlements are delivered in both letter and spirit.

Editorial Analysis
**********Delimitation and the south
Why in news?
Union Home Minister Amit Shah assured that southern states would not lose any parliamentary seats after delimitation, addressing concerns of states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
Due to slower population growth in the South compared to the North, delimitation based on the latest data could have resulted in a significant increase in seats for northern states.
Delimitation, which redraws constituency boundaries, is expected after the delayed Census and was initially set for 2026. In Independent India’s history, delimitation has taken place four times – 1952, 1963, 1973 and 2002.
What’s in today’s article?
Need for Delimitation
Impact of Delimitation on Lok Sabha Seats
Concerns of Southern States Over Delimitation
is a constitutional mandate carried out after each Census to readjust the number of seats in Parliament and state Assemblies and redefine constituency boundaries.
Article 82 of the Constitution
mandates that after each Census, the allocation of Lok Sabha seats must be adjusted based on population changes.
However,
Article 81
limits the total number of Lok Sabha members to 550, with 530 from states and 20 from Union Territories.
It also requires that the ratio of seats to the population in each state be as uniform as possible, ensuring that constituencies across the country have roughly equal populations.
The goal is to ensure equal representation by maintaining similar population sizes across constituencies.
History of Delimitation in India
Pre-1976:
After the Censuses of 1951, 1961, and 1971, seats in Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and state Assemblies were redistributed.
42nd Amendment (1976):
During the Emergency, Parliament froze the total number of seats until the 2001 Census to prevent states with higher population growth from losing representation while implementing family planning measures.
2001 Delimitation:
While constituency boundaries were redrawn, the number of seats remained unchanged due to opposition from southern states.
Impact of Delimitation on Lok Sabha Seats and Elections
The number of seats each state receives after delimitation will depend on the base average population that a future delimitation commission establishes.
In 1977, each MP represented an average of 10.11 lakh people. Ideally, constituencies should be evenly distributed around this average.
Potential Increase in Lok Sabha Strength
If the 10.11 lakh average is retained, Lok Sabha strength could rise to nearly 1,400 based on 2025 population projections.
UP (including Uttarakhand) could see its seats triple from 85 to 250, while Bihar (including Jharkhand) could increase from 25 to 82.
Tamil Nadu and Kerala would see only moderate increases (39 to 76 and 20 to 36, respectively).
Since the new Parliament has only 888 seats, this formula is unlikely to be implemented.
Experts believe that regardless of the formula, southern states would gain fewer seats compared to northern states, reinforcing concerns over their diminishing political influence.
Impact of Delimitation on Elections
Regional parties in the South fear that delimitation based on population will benefit parties with a strong base in North India.
Southern states fear that delimitation based on the latest population data will reduce their representation in Parliament, weakening their political influence.
Tamil Nadu CM M.K. Stalin announced an all-party meeting on March 5 to discuss delimitation, calling it a looming threat to southern states.
He warned that Tamil Nadu could lose parliamentary seats due to its success in family planning.

**********Donald Trump offers $5-million ‘gold card’ visas for US citizenship
Why in news?
US President Donald Trump introduced a new "gold card" immigration initiative, replacing the EB-5 visa program. For a $5 million investment, wealthy foreign investors can gain a path to U.S. citizenship and permanent residency.
The existing EB-5 program, established in 1990, requires a minimum investment of $1.05 million (or $800,000 in distressed areas) to create or preserve jobs.
It has faced criticism for fraud and misuse, including funding projects linked to Trump family businesses.
What’s in today’s article?
EB-5 Visa Program
Comparison: EB-5 vs. Gold Card
Potential Benefits of the Gold Card Program
Concerns Surrounding the Gold Card Program
Challenges Ahead for the Gold Card Program
Impact of Gold Card Program on Indian Investors
Established by the U.S. Congress in 1990, the EB-5 visa program aimed to boost the American economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors.
Investment Requirements
The program grants green cards to immigrants who invest at least $1,050,000 or $800,000 in economically distressed areas, known as targeted employment areas.
Capping
The EB-5 program was capped at 10,000 visas annually with 3,000 reserved for investments in high-unemployment areas.
Criticism and Controversies
The program faced criticism for deviating from its intended purpose, with reports indicating that businesses and Trump family members used it to fund major property developments.
Calls for reform grew during Trump’s presidency.
Renewal and Legal Challenges
The program was last renewed under President Joe Biden in 2022, with investment thresholds raised.
The Trump administration attempted to increase the minimum investment for targeted areas to $900,000 in 2019, but a federal judge overturned this decision in 2021.
EB-5 Program
Established in 1990 and managed by USCIS.
Grants Green Cards to foreign investors who invest at least $1.05 million ($800,000 in certain cases).
Requires the creation of at least 10 jobs for Americans.
Likely does not require investment in American businesses or job creation.
Allows direct purchase of a Green Card for $5 million.
Administration and Processing
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is expected to regulate and issue Gold Cards.
Likely involvement of the Department of State and Department of Commerce.
Faster processing times anticipated to encourage participation.
Attracting Wealthy Investors
The straightforward residency pathway may encourage high-net-worth individuals to move to the U.S.
These investors could contribute to the economy through real estate, luxury markets, and business investments.
Reducing Fraud Risks
The EB-5 program has faced allegations of fraud.
A direct, high-cost purchase model may help minimize misuse and regulatory loopholes.
Citizenship for Sale
The program prioritizes wealth over merit, potentially disadvantaging skilled professionals.
It raises ethical and political concerns about fairness in immigration policy.
Risk of Financial Misuse
Investment-based immigration programs can be exploited for money laundering and foreign influence.
Lack of strong regulatory oversight may increase these risks.
No Economic Contribution Requirement
Unlike EB-5, the Gold Card does not mandate job creation or business investment.
Passive investors could gain residency without contributing to the U.S. economy.
Historical Precedents and Policy Questions
A similar program in Canada was discontinued due to widespread misuse.
Key concerns remain: Should U.S. citizenship be available for purchase? Should immigration policy prioritize skills and economic contributions?
Legislative Hurdles in Congress
Immigration policy changes require congressional approval.
While Republicans hold a majority, not all may support a program perceived as "selling" citizenship.
Democrats are expected to oppose the proposal.
Potential Legal Challenges
Most visa-related legal issues arise from program administration rather than the policy itself.
It is uncertain what legal challenges the Gold Card may face.
In 2023, only 631 Indians obtained Green Cards through the EB-5 program.
Given the $5 million (₹43 crore) price tag, the Gold Card may not be attractive to many Indian investors.
Impact on applicants from other categories
Over a million Indians are among those waiting for green cards in the U.S., according to US government data.
In employment-based categories, the backlog for Indian applicants is projected to reach 2.19 million by 2030.
Any new category will add to their waiting period.

**********[27th February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Coal power is costing India up to 10% of its rice and wheat crops
Enviro & Biodiversity
PYQ Relevance:
) “In spite of adverse environmental impact, coal mining is still inevitable for Development”. Discuss.
(UPSC CSE 2017)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on the
diverse environmental impact of coal  (2017),
environmental impacts of coal-fired thermal plants
(2014).
India relies on coal for 65% of its electricity due to its low cost and large reserves. Coal-fired power plants release harmful gases like CO₂, SOx, NOx, and particulate matter, causing pollution and climate issues. Using Low NOx Burners with Over Fire Air technology can reduce NOx emissions by 45-80% without affecting power generation.
Today’s editorial discusses pollution caused by coal-fired power plants in India. This information is relevant for GS Paper 3 in the UPSC Mains exam.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
New research from Stanford University in the US shows that coal-fired power plants are reducing India’s rice and wheat production, causing up to a 10% loss in several states.
Why did the researchers focus on nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) emissions?
Phytotoxic Effects on Crops:
NO₂ is
phytotoxic
, meaning it directly harms plant health by interfering with cellular functions and enzymatic activities.
Example:
In agricultural areas near coal plants, NO₂ exposure leads to lower chlorophyll levels, reducing plant vitality and yield.
Formation of Secondary Pollutants:
NO₂ contributes to the formation of
ground-level ozone
, which further damages crops by limiting photosynthesis and causing oxidative stress.
Increased ozone formation near coal hubs like Chhattisgarh exacerbates crop loss during peak growing seasons.
Limited Existing Research in India:
While global studies link NO₂ to agricultural damage, there was no systematic study at the power-plant level in India.
This research fills the gap by connecting NO₂ emissions from coal plants directly to wheat and rice yield losses.
Satellite Data Availability:
Advanced satellites like TROPOMI allow precise tracking of NO₂ concentrations, making it easier to study the pollutant’s widespread effects.
Researchers used satellite-derived vegetation indices (NIRv) to measure crop health across polluted regions.
High Contribution from Coal Plants:
Coal-fired power plants are a major source of NO₂ emissions, especially in industrial and agricultural belts.
In Chhattisgarh, around
19%
of monsoon-season NO₂ comes from coal plants, causing significant crop damage.
How does this pollutant impact plant health and crop yield?
Disruption of Photosynthesis:
NO₂ reduces the amount of sunlight available for photosynthesis by forming secondary pollutants like particulate matter. This limits energy production in plants.
In areas near coal plants, reduced sunlight exposure leads to a
5-10% decline
in rice and wheat yields in states like West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.
Cellular and Enzymatic Damage:
NO₂ interferes with crucial cellular processes and enzymatic functions, weakening plant growth and reducing their ability to absorb nutrients.
Crops exposed to high NO₂ levels in Chhattisgarh show slower growth and lower productivity, especially during peak seasons.
Ozone Formation and Oxidative Stress:
NO₂ contributes to ground-level ozone, which causes oxidative stress in plants, leading to leaf damage and reduced crop yields.
In Uttar Pradesh, where overall NO₂ levels are high, wheat crops suffer significant losses due to ozone-induced stress during the winter season.
Which states show the highest agricultural losses?
Chhattisgarh:
The most affected region with the highest share of NO₂ pollution from coal plants (19% during the monsoon and 12.5% in winter). It is a major hub for coal-fired power generation, leading to severe air pollution and crop yield losses.
West Bengal:
There are significant NO₂ exposure from coal plants that affects 5.7% of cropland, with yield losses between 5-10% and even greater than 10% in some areas. The proximity of coal plants to fertile agricultural zones increases the impact on rice and wheat production.
Madhya Pradesh:
About 5.9% of cropland near coal plants experiences 5-10% yield losses, while 11.9% of agricultural land could face losses exceeding 10%.
Uttar Pradesh:
High overall NO₂ pollution, but only a small portion originates from coal-fired power plants. The other industrial sources dominate NO₂ emissions, yet coal plants still add to the burden on winter wheat yields.
Tamil Nadu:
Low overall NO₂ levels but a large share comes from coal plants, disproportionately affecting local agriculture. The concentration of coal-fired power plants contributes a substantial portion of the region’s air pollution.
What steps have been taken by the Indian government?
Increased Budget Allocation for Coal Sector
: The
2025-2026 Union Budget
has increased the allocation for the
Ministry of Coal by 255%
over the revised estimates of FY 2024-2025, reflecting a focus on managing coal resources and addressing environmental concerns.
Pollution Control Mandates
: The government has
introduced emission norms
for coal-fired power plants, requiring the installation of
pollution control equipment
Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD)
to reduce nitrogen oxides (NO₂) and other pollutants.
Renewable Energy Promotion
: Policies such as the
National Solar Mission
and incentives for
renewable energy
aim to
reduce coal dependency
and minimize air pollution while promoting
cleaner energy alternatives
Way forward:
Strengthen Emission Regulations
: Implement stricter NO₂ emission limits for coal-fired power plants, enforce regular monitoring, and expedite the adoption of advanced pollution control technologies like selective catalytic reduction (SCR).
Promote Sustainable Agriculture and Clean Energy
: Support farmers in NO₂-affected regions with resilient crop varieties and promote a transition to renewable energy through increased investment in solar and wind infrastructure.
**********A leap backward for maternity entitlements
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Legal Maternity Benefit;
Why in the News?
All pregnant women in India are entitled to maternity benefits, yet the majority have not received any financial support in recent years.
What are the legal maternity benefit provisions under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013?
Universal Entitlement (Except Formal Sector):
All pregnant and lactating women (excluding those already receiving maternity benefits in the formal sector) are legally entitled to receive
₹6,000 per child
to support nutrition and health.
Objective of Nutrition and Health Support:
The provision aims to improve maternal and child health by ensuring better access to nutrition, rest, and medical care during pregnancy and after childbirth.
Legal Obligation for Central Government:
It is the legal duty of the central government to ensure maternity benefits are provided without arbitrary reductions or restrictions.
How do they compare to the benefits provided under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)?
Coverage Scope
NFSA 2013:
Provides
pregnant and lactating women (excluding those in the formal sector).
PMMVY:
₹5,000
only for the
first child
(recently extended to the
second child
if it is a girl), violating the universal entitlement under NFSA.
Implementation Efficiency
Mandates
universal coverage
without restrictive conditions to ensure access for all eligible women.
Imposes
strict conditions
(e.g., Aadhaar verification) and
complex processes
, leading to
low disbursement
rates and
exclusion
of many entitled women.
What are the issues related to Scant information?
Minimal Data Disclosure:
The Ministry of Women and Child Development provides limited information on PMMVY, violating Section 4 of the RTI Act, which mandates proactive disclosure of public data. For example, basic details like the number of beneficiaries and payment status are not available.
RTI-Driven Insights:
Information on PMMVY coverage is only accessible through RTI queries. For instance, RTI data revealed that effective coverage dropped from 36% in 2019-20 to just 9% in 2023-24, highlighting the program’s declining reach.
Budgetary Secrecy:
There is little transparency about financial allocations and expenditures. For example, official records do not openly explain why central government spending fell to ₹870 crore in 2023-24—just one-third of the amount five years earlier.
Why has the effective coverage of the PMMVY declined sharply since 2019-20?
Software-Related Issues and Technical Glitches:
In 2023-24, major changes in the PMMVY’s software and implementation processes caused frequent system failures, delaying or blocking payments. Officials admitted to facing software issues “every day,” leading to a reduced disbursement rate despite consistent applications.
Restrictive Eligibility and Complex Documentation:
PMMVY limits benefits to only the first child (and a second child if a girl), violating the universal entitlement under the NFSA. Strict Aadhaar-based verification and other conditions exclude migrant workers and women in remote areas who struggle to complete the paperwork.
Budget Cuts and Reduced Government Spending:
Central government spending on PMMVY fell to ₹870 crore in 2023-24, just one-third of the amount five years earlier. This underfunding directly reduced the number of eligible women receiving maternity benefits.
How do the maternity benefit schemes in Tamil Nadu and Odisha differ from the PMMVY?
Higher Financial Assistance:
Tamil Nadu provides ₹18,000 per child (with a promise to increase it to ₹24,000), and Odisha offers ₹10,000 per child. In comparison, PMMVY provides only ₹5,000 for the first child (and a second child if a girl), which is below the ₹6,000 mandated by the NFSA.
Inclusive Eligibility Criteria:
Tamil Nadu and Odisha offer benefits for every childbirth without restrictive conditions. PMMVY, however, limits benefits to the first child (with a recent extension to the second child if a girl), excluding many eligible women.
Better Implementation and Coverage:
Tamil Nadu achieved 84% coverage in 2023-24, and Odisha covered 64% of births in 2021-22. In contrast, PMMVY’s effective coverage fell to just 9% in 2023-24 due to software glitches, reduced spending, and complex documentation.
What role did software-related problems play in further reducing disbursements in 2023-24?
Frequent System Failures:
Major changes in PMMVY’s software and implementation processes in 2023-24 caused regular technical glitches, disrupting the payment system and delaying disbursements. Officials reported encountering software issues daily.
Reduced Disbursement Rate:
Despite consistent applications, technical problems led to a sharp decline in the actual release of benefits. The disbursement rate dropped significantly, contributing to a fall in effective coverage to just 9% in 2023-24.
Way forward:
Simplify Implementation and Strengthen Technology Infrastructure:
Ensure robust, user-friendly software systems with regular maintenance to prevent glitches. Simplify application processes and reduce bureaucratic hurdles for timely disbursement.
Expand Coverage and Increase Funding:
Align PMMVY benefits with NFSA provisions by providing ₹6,000 for every child. Increase budgetary allocations to ensure universal access and include marginalized groups like migrant workers.
Mains PYQ:
What are the salient features of the National Food Security Act, 2013? How has the Food Security Bill helped in eliminating hunger and malnutrition in India?

**********Why are PwDs worried about DPDP rules?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to PwDs;
Why in the News?
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) plans to complete public consultations on the draft Rules for the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, by March 5. Meanwhile, disability rights activists are urging changes to a key provision of the Act.
Why are persons with disabilities concerned about a certain provision in the draft Rules of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023?
Infringement on Autonomy and Decision-Making Capacity:
Section 9(1) clubs adult PwDs with children, requiring consent from a legal guardian for processing personal data. This undermines their ability to make independent decisions.
Example
: An adult with a physical disability wanting to access online banking may be restricted if the platform requires guardian consent.
Lack of Clarity and Ambiguity in Implementation:
The Act does not clearly outline how consent should be obtained across various disabilities and degrees of severity, leading to confusion.
: A person with limited cognitive impairment under “limited guardianship” may still be treated as entirely incapable.
Conflict with UNCRPD Principles:
The provision conflicts with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which emphasizes supported decision-making over substituted decision-making.
: Under the RPWD Act, a PwD may receive assistance only when necessary, but the DPDP Act assumes total incapacity if a legal guardian exists, contradicting the UNCRPD framework.
Concerns About Privacy and Data Security:
Platforms may need to collect sensitive information (like whether a user has a disability) to verify guardianship status, raising privacy concerns.
Exclusion from Digital Services:
The additional procedural burden on PwDs and data fiduciaries could lead to exclusion from essential digital platforms.
How do guardianships for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) function?
Governed by Two Laws:
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016:
Allows for
, where PwDs are supported in making specific legal decisions. This aligns with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) by preserving decision-making autonomy.
National Trust (NT) Act, 1999:
Provides for
full guardianship
for individuals with autism, cerebral palsy, intellectual disabilities, or multiple disabilities. This model is more paternalistic and conflicts with the UNCRPD’s emphasis on autonomy.
Practical Challenges:
Although the RPWD Act emphasizes limited guardianship, PwDs often report that their guardians control all aspects of their lives. The NT Act’s rigid framework assumes a lack of decision-making capacity without defining clear standards for assessing it.
How are legal guardians defined under the draft rules?
legal guardians:
Under the draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025, legal guardians are defined as individuals appointed through specific legal frameworks to act on behalf of persons with disabilities (PwDs).
Data Fiduciaries
are required to verify the guardian’s appointment by a court of law, designated authority, or local-level committee under applicable guardianship laws.
Who are data fiduciaries and data principals?
Data Fiduciaries:
Entities (organizations, companies, or individuals) that
collect, store, and process personal data
while determining the
purpose and means
of such processing under the
Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023
Data principals:
Individuals whose
is being collected, processed, or stored. This term generally refers to
users, consumers, or citizens
under the DPDP Act.
Where does the conflict lie?
Presumption of Incapacity vs. Legal Recognition of Capacity:
The DPDP Act assumes adult PwDs lack the capacity to give consent if a guardian is involved, whereas the RPWD Act recognizes their legal capacity and promotes their right to make decisions.
: A person with mild intellectual disability working in a corporate setting may need guardian approval for routine data-related tasks, despite their ability to understand and consent.
Data Privacy vs. Intrusive Verification:
The DPDP Act may require platforms to collect and verify sensitive disability information, potentially breaching privacy rights, while the UNCRPD emphasizes the right to privacy without discrimination.
: An online service requiring disability verification for consent could store unnecessary sensitive data, increasing risks of unauthorized access or misuse.
Way forward:
Adopt a Supported Decision-Making Model:
Align the DPDP Act with the
by recognizing
and allowing PwDs to provide
independent consent
with appropriate support when needed.
Ensure Privacy and Minimize Data Collection:
Limit the collection of
to essential cases, ensuring
purpose limitation
data minimization
while protecting PwDs’
Mains PYQ:
Impact of digital technology as a reliable source of input for rational decision-making is a debatable issue. Critically evaluate with a suitable example.

About the Tea Horse Road
The Tea Horse Road originated during the
Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE)
Buddhist monk
Yijing (635-713 CE)
recorded early trade between
China, Tibet, and India
, mentioning exchanges of
sugar, textiles, and herbs

word-of-mouth
rather than digital sources for price information.
Multiple intermediaries
in the supply chain reduce farmers’ share in the
final consumer price
64% of farmers
reported

) aboard a
SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket
from California.
What is the SPHEREx Telescope?
SPHEREx is a new space telescope developed by
It is designed to
map the entire sky
infrared light
and provide insights into the origins of the universe, galaxy formation, and the distribution of life-forming molecules.
Its mission is expected to last
2 years
, during which it will
survey the sky
4 times
Key Features of SPHEREx:
Infrared Spectroscopy
: Unlike traditional optical telescopes, SPHEREx will capture the universe in
102 infrared colors
, which are invisible to the human eye.
Wide-Sky Coverage
: Unlike the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
, which focuses on narrow regions, SPHEREx will map the entire sky every
6 months
High Data Output
: It will collect data on
one billion galaxies
100 million stars
10,000 asteroids
, creating an unprecedented cosmic map.
Study of Cosmic Inflation
: SPHEREx will analyze the
earliest moments after the Big Bang
, helping scientists understand how the universe expanded rapidly in its infancy.
Search for Life-Forming Molecules
: The telescope will identify
biogenic molecules
like water, carbon dioxide, and methanol in the
Milky Way galaxy
, revealing where the building blocks of life exist.
How will SPHEREx Create the “Most Colourful” Map of the Cosmos?
Spectroscopic Imaging
: SPHEREx will divide light from celestial objects into
96 infrared bands
, significantly more than previous sky-mapping telescopes.
Mapping Galactic Evolution
: By observing
450 million galaxies
, SPHEREx will reveal how they evolved over cosmic history.
Identifying Cosmic Ice
: The telescope will detect frozen water and organic molecules in interstellar dust clouds, essential for understanding planetary formation.
Unprecedented Infrared Insights
Hubble
, which focuses on optical light, and
, which targets deep-space infrared observations, SPHEREx will capture
broad infrared spectra
across the entire sky, revealing hidden cosmic structures.
