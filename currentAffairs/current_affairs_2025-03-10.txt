Background: –
Newly elected Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam (Labour Party) shares a historic connection with India. His father, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, led Mauritius to independence and worked with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
Key takeaways
People to people ties
Nearly 70% of Mauritius population is of Indian origin, mainly descendants of indentured laborers brought by colonial rulers. About 50% trace their ancestry to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and still speak the Bhojpuri dialect.
There are smaller communities of Tamil, Telugu-, and Marathi-speaking communities.
In 1976, India inaugurated the Mahatma Gandhi Institute as a premier institution for promoting Indian languages and culture.
The Indian Cultural Centre in Mauritius is the largest of anywhere in the world. The island hosts the World Hindi Secretariat that is supported by India.
Economic and Trade Cooperation
Bilateral trade reached $554 million in 2022-23.
Mauritius serves as a business gateway to Africa, being part of the African Union.
Due to a favourable Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India, Mauritius is also a major channel for foreign investment into India.
Mauritius has emerged as a successful international financial centre.
Maritime Security Cooperation
Mauritius is strategically located in the western Indian Ocean.
The Colombo Security Conclave brings together India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Mauritius and Bangladesh to ensure regional maritime security.
Mauritius has a vast EEZ of 2.3 million sq. km, making surveillance vital.
India has set up a chain of coastal radar stations, redeveloped the Mauritian island of Agaléga to serve as a joint surveillance facility and given Mauritius access to the Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) in Gurugram, to significantly advance domain awareness in its vast EEZ.
India’s oceanographic survey ship, INS Sarvekshak, has completed the survey of 25,000 sq.km of Mauritius’ ocean territory.
At a time when China’s footprint in the Indian Ocean is expanding, India-Mauritius maritime security cooperation has assumed special importance.

MADHAV NATIONAL PARK
Prelims  – ENVIRONMENT
The Centre declared the Madhav National Park in Madhya Pradesh as the country’s 58th tiger reserve on Sunday (March 9, 2025).
Three tigers, including two females, were introduced to the Madhav National Park in 2023 as part of the tiger reintroduction project in the State.
Madhav National Park is country’s 58th tiger reserve and also the ninth from the State of Madhya Pradesh.
Notably, on December 2, 2024 India got its 57th tiger reserve in the Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary of Madhya Pradesh.
Madhav National Park is a protected area located in the Shivpuri district of Madhya Pradesh, India.
Established in 1959, Madhav National Park was originally a hunting ground for the erstwhile Scindia royal family. the park was named after Madho Rao Scindia, the Maharaja of Gwalior.
Madhav National Park is situated in the northern part of Madhya Pradesh. It lies on the northern fringe of the Central Highlands of India, forming part of the Upper Vindhyan Hills intermixed with plateaus and valley sections.
Notable lakes within the park include Sakhya Sagar and Madhav Sagar, both created by damming the Manihar River.
Fauna: Madhav National Park hosts a variety of wildlife, including:
Mammals: Species such as the Indian gazelle (Chinkara), Chital (Spotted deer), Nilgai (Blue bull), Sambar deer, Four-horned antelope (Chousingha), Sloth bear, Leopard, Indian wolf, Jackal, Bengal fox, Dhole (Wild dog), Wild boar, and Porcupine.
Reptiles: The park is home to reptiles like the Mugger crocodile, various turtle species, and snakes.
Birds: The lakes attract numerous migratory birds during winter, including species of geese, ducks, and waders.
Historical Significance:
George Castle: At the park’s highest point (484 meters), George Castle was built in 1911 by Madho Rao Scindia for an anticipated visit by King George V, although the king never stayed there.
Conservation Efforts:
Ramsar Site: In January 2022, a 248-hectare area around Sakhya Sagar Lake within the park was designated as a Ramsar site, recognizing its importance as a wetland of international significance.

INDIA'S SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
India is set to roll out its first domestically manufactured semiconductor chip in 2025.
This initiative aims to reduce India’s dependency on semiconductor imports, which have risen significantly over the past decade.
Semicon India Programme
The Semicon India Programme, launched in 2021, aims to develop the semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem.
Key Initiatives: Five manufacturing facilities are under construction for the manufacturing and assembly of semiconductor chips, backed by the Semicon India Programme.
Notable projects:
Tata Semiconductor Assembly and Test Facility – Morigaon, Assam.
Dholera Semiconductor Fabrication (Fab) Facility – Tata Electronics in collaboration with Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation.
However, the actual spending under the Semicon India Programme has consistently fallen short of budgeted allocations.

Monolithic Integrated Circuits (ICs) – Used in CPUs, smartphones, automobiles, medical devices, and industrial automation.
Memory Chips – Includes volatile (RAM) and non-volatile (NAND flash).
Amplifiers – Used in wireless communication and audio equipment.
Import trends (FY16-FY24):
Monolithic IC imports increased by 2,000%.
Memory chip imports surged by 4,500%.
Amplifier imports rose by 4,800%.
Semiconductor imports now constitute a higher share of total imports, with monolithic ICs forming 2.09% of total imports in FY25, up from 0.19% in FY16.
Major Semiconductor Suppliers to India
Top Supplier: China (except FY19).
Other key sources: Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.
Challenges in India’s Semiconductor Ecosystem
With the new facilities, India will be able to add value in the assembly, testing, and packaging, and fab segments of the global value chain for semiconductors, but it is yet to make major strides in –
EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software – Critical for chip design.
Core IP (Intellectual Property) – Patents for semiconductor technology.
Wafers – Key raw material for chip fabrication.
Fab tools and ATP (Assembly, Testing, and Packaging) tools – Machinery required for semiconductor manufacturing.

SHARAVATHI PUMPED STORAGE
Prelims- CURRENT EVENT
After receiving a nod from the State Wildlife Board of Karnataka in January, the controversial Sharavathi pumped-storage project has now secured final approval from the state government.
The project has encountered environmental concerns, particularly due to its location within the Sharavathi Lion Tailed Macaque Sanctuary.
The project is situated on the Sharavathi River in Karnataka, India. The Sharavathi River is a vital source of hydroelectric power in the region and is known for the Jog Falls, one of the highest waterfalls in India.
Key Features:
Capacity: The project is designed to generate 2,000 megawatts (MW) of power, utilizing eight units of 250 MW each.
It leverages existing water bodies—the Talakalale and Gerusoppa reservoirs—as the upper and lower reservoirs, respectively. The Talakalale dam, standing at 62.48 meters, and the 64-meter high Gerusoppa dam are integral to the project’s infrastructure.
During periods of low electricity demand, water will be pumped from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir using grid power. When electricity demand is high, water from the upper reservoir will be released to generate electricity.
Additional Information – Sharavathi River
The Sharavathi River is a west-flowing river in Karnataka.
It originates in the Western Ghats and flows into the Arabian Sea, making it an important river for Karnataka’s water resources and biodiversity.

grants protection to individuals who are arrested or detained.
It has
two parts
—the
first part
deals with
cases of ordinary law,
which includes situations where an individual is detained as part of a criminal investigation.
second part deals with cases of preventive detention law,
which pertains to the detention of individuals without a trial or conviction.
Article 22(4)
states that
no law providing for preventive detention shall authoris
e the

entitled to know the grounds of his detention.
, however,
may refuse to divulge the grounds
of detention if it is
in the public interest
to do so.
The detaining authorities must give the detainee earliest opportunities for making representation against the detention.
Who can make laws under Preventive Detention?
Parliament
has the exclusive power to enact a law for preventive detention
for reasons connected with defence, foreign affairs, or security of India.
Both Parliament and State Legislature
have powers to enact a law for preventive detention for reasons related to the
maintenance of public order
or the
maintenance of supplies or services
essential to the community.
Laws that provide for Preventive Detention:
In India, various laws pr
ovide for preventive detention, including the National Security Act (NSA)
of 1980, the
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA)
of 1967, and state-specific laws like the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) and the
Public Safety Acts (PSA) in certain states
Under these laws, authorities can detain an individual for a specific period, typically up to 12 months, without presenting formal charges or conducting a trial.

This visit,
occurring amidst global geopolitical uncertainties, provides an opportunity for India to reaffirm its commitment
to Mauritius’ prosperity, security, and development.
The Historical Bond Between India and Mauritius
India and Mauritius share
a relationship rooted in history, culture, and kinship.
Mauritius has
a substantial Indian-origin population, with nearly 70% of its citizens tracing their ancestry to Indian indentured
labourers brought by colonial rulers to work on sugar plantations.
country is a melting pot of cultures
, with Indo-Mauritians preserving languages such as Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi.
The bond between the two nations
extends beyond cultural similarities
Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam
Mauritius’ first Prime Minister
and a key figure in its independence movement, was
deeply connected to India’s freedom struggle.
His association with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose
in London during the early 20th century highlights
the intertwined histories of both nations.
Over the years,
India has played an active role in promoting Mauritius’ cultural heritage,
as seen in initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi Institute and the Indian Cultural Centre, the largest of its kind worldwide.
Key Features of India-Mauritius Relations and Cooperation
Diplomatic and Political Stability
Regardless of the party in power,
India-Mauritius relations have remained stable and positive.
The r
ecent election of Navinchandra Ramgoolam as Prime Minister presents an opportunity
for further strengthening bilateral cooperation.
During his previous tenure,
Mr.
Ramgoolam demonstrated a keen understanding of India’s security concerns
, and his leadership is expected to open new avenues for collaboration.
For Indian diplomats, maintaining strong relationships
across all segments of Mauritian
society is crucial.
While cultural and linguistic ties with the Indo-Mauritian population are important,
engaging with the country’s diverse ethnic groups,
including the influential French-origin population,
ensures balanced diplomatic outreach.
Economic and Trade Cooperation
Economic cooperation
India and Mauritius has grown significantly in recent year

Strengthening economic ties
through trade and investment will further enhance mutual benefits.
India’s Strategic Initiatives in Mauritius
Coastal Radar Stations
India has established
a network of coastal radar stations in Mauritius to monitor activities in the vast exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
These stations provide real-time data on ship movements,
helping both nations detect potential threats such as illegal fishing, smuggling, piracy,
and unauthorised military presence.
Upgrading Agaléga Island
India has significantly
redeveloped the Mauritian island of Agaléga
, transforming it into a crucial joint surveillance and naval facility.

, free from external influences that could disrupt the balance of power.
The India-Mauritius partnership serves as a counterbalance to China's presence
and reinforces India’s role as the primary security provider in the region.
Conclusion
rime Minister Modi’s visit to Mauritius goes beyond ceremonial honours;
it is a reaffirmation of India’s commitment to a stable, prosperous, and secure Indian Ocean region.

**********The Empowerment of India’s Women with Bold Policies
Context
International Women’s Day
on March 8 serves
as a timely reminder of the progress made toward gender equality
and the work that remains.
India has made notable strides in empowering women
, with government policies playing a crucial role in improving access to sanitation, clean water, financial inclusion, and entrepreneurship.
These
initiatives have not only enhanced women’s daily lives but have also reshaped their roles
in governance, the workforce, and community leadership.
Government Initiatives in Women’s Empowerment
Sanitation and Clean Water: A Foundation for Dignity and Economic Participation
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission)
This
program particularly benefited women in rural areas
, where open defecation posed safety and health risks.
By constructing over 116 million household toilets,
the initiative has provided women with a sense of security, privacy, and dignity.
Community-driven efforts, such as those led by
the Maa Tarini Self-Help Group (SHG) in Rourkela,
further highlight the mission’s impact.
These grassroots initiatives demonstrate how sanitation efforts
can be both socially transformative and economically beneficial.
Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM)
Before its implementation,
only 17% of rural households had tap water connections
, forcing women to spend hours fetching water.
Today, over 150 million households have access to safe drinking water
, significantly reducing women’s time burden and enabling greater participation in education, work, and economic activities.
availability of water has had a direct impact on female labour force participation
Studies indicate a 7
.4% increase in women’s engagement
in agriculture and allied sectors, particularly in states like Bihar and Jharkhand, where female workforce participation was historically low.
Between 2017 and 2023, rural female workforce participation rose from 24.6% to 41.5%,
demonstrating how infrastructural development can drive social change and economic independence.
Government Initiatives Directed Towards Financial Inclusion of Women
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)
Launched in 2014,
PMJDY has been instrumental in bringing women into the formal banking system.
More than 300 million bank accounts have been opened for women
under this initiative, allowing them to save money, access credit, and engage in financial transactions independently.
scheme has also introduced direct benefit transfers (DBT),
ensuring that government subsidies reach women directly, reducing dependency on intermediaries.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)
scheme provides collateral-free loans to small and micro enterprises,
particularly benefiting women entrepreneurs.
Out of the total ₹32.36 lakh crore
sanctioned under Mudra Yojana,
68% of the loans have been given to women.
scheme has supported businesses ranging from handicrafts and textiles to food processing and retail,
allowing women to transition from informal labour to entrepreneurship.
Stand-Up India Scheme
Aimed at promoting entrepreneurship among women and marginalised communities,
this scheme provides loans ranging from ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore.
So
far, over ₹53,609 crore has been sanctioned to 236,000 entrepreneurs
, helping women establish and expand their businesses.
By offering financial literacy programs alongside credit access, the scheme ensures that women are equipped with the necessary skills
to manage and grow their enterprises.
Digital Connectivity and the Rise of Women Entrepreneurs
BharatNet and PM-WANI Initiatives
BharatNet and the Prime Minister Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM-WANI) have
expanded high-speed internet access to 199,000 villages and 214,000 gram panchayats
The establishment of over 247,000 Wi-Fi hotspots has enabled women in rural areas to
access online banking, digital payment systems, and e-commerce platforms
UPI and Digital Payments
The rise of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has made financial transactions more
accessible
to women entrepreneurs.
Women-led businesses, particularly in rural areas, are now able to receive payments seamlessly,
reducing their reliance on cash transactions and improving financial transparency.
E-commerce and Market Access
Digital platforms have provided women entrepreneurs
with a gateway to larger markets beyond their local communities.
Government e-Marketplace (GeM) has been instrumental in integrating women-led businesses
into the national procurement system.
Over 100,000 women-led micro and small enterprises (MSEs) are now active on the GeM
portal, securing contracts worth ₹46,615 crore.
Case Study: Women Entrepreneurs Leveraging Technology
A compelling example of digital empowerment is
Reena Kirar
, an entrepreneur from Madhya Pradesh.
She
leads the Girja Devi Jan Kalyan Samiti, a self-help group producing textiles
, food products, and household goods.
By leveraging the GeM portal, Reena expanded her business beyond her local village,
reaching customers across the country.
Women’s Representation in Governance
Political empowerment
is another critical area where India has made significant progress.
government’s recent implementation of a 33% reservation for women
in legislative bodies marks a transformative shift in governance.
Women are no longer passive participants but key decision-makers
shaping national policies.
At the grassroots level,
women constitute approximately 46% of elected representatives in Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs),
with over 1.4 million women actively engaged in rural governance.
Their
leadership has led to more community-centred policies
, improving healthcare, education, and public safety.
developments highlight a broader truth: when women lead, societies thrive.
Remaining Challenges and the Way Forward
Limited Access to Credit
While government schemes
have improved credit access, many women still struggle to secure large-scale funding
due to a lack of collateral and financial history.
Expanding microfinance institutions (MFIs)
and encouraging venture capital investment in women-led businesses could help bridge this gap.
Societal and Cultural Barriers
Traditional gender norms
in some parts of India
still discourage women from pursuing entrepreneurship.
Awareness campaigns and
mentorship programs led by successful female entrepreneurs can help change perceptions
and inspire more women to start businesses.
Need for Digital Literacy
While digital penetration has improved, a significant digital literacy gap still exists, particularly among rural women.
Government and private sector initiatives must focus on providing digital training to women
, ensuring they can fully leverage online banking, e-commerce, and digital marketing tools.
Conclusion
India’s strides in women’s empowerment through sanitation, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship,
and governance are shaping a
more inclusive and equitable society.
government’s targeted policies
have not only improved women’s quality of life but have also unlocked economic and leadership opportunities.
While progress is evident, sustaining this momentum requires continuous policy focus, investment in education
, and the dismantling of socio-economic barriers.

**********India’s Obesity Problem
Why in news?
PM Modi, in a public address in Silvassa, highlighted obesity as the “root cause of many diseases” and urged Indians to reduce oil consumption. He referenced projections from The Lancet, stating that 44 crore people in India could be obese by 2050.
What’s in today’s article?
Obesity Trends - Global and Indian
Defining Obesity
Vulnerable section
Health Risks Associated with Obesity
Causes of the Obesity Epidemic
According to studies published in The Lancet, a majority of adults and a third of children worldwide will be overweight or obese by 2050.
In 2021, there were 211 crore overweight or obese individuals globally, making up 45% of the world’s population.
Half of the world’s overweight and obese adults were from eight countries:
China (40.2 crore)
India (18 crore)
USA (17.2 crore)
Brazil (8.8 crore)
Russia (7.1 crore)
Mexico (5.8 crore)
Indonesia (5.2 crore)
Egypt (4.1 crore)
Obesity is commonly measured using Body Mass Index (BMI), which is the ratio of a person’s weight to their height squared.
BMI > 30
→ Obese
BMI 25-30
→ Overweight
For children and adolescents (ages
5-17
), the
International Obesity Task Force’s weight-for-age and gender criteria
are used.
A Lancet commission recommended updating this definition by introducing
"clinical obesity" and "preclinical obesity"
A clinical obesity diagnosis should consider two of four body size parameters: BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio.
The presence of
obesity-related symptoms
(e.g., breathlessness, sleep apnea, fatigue, joint pain) is crucial in diagnosis.
Individuals with high body size parameters but
no symptoms
would be categorized as
This revision ensures a
more accurate assessment
of obesity-related health risks, particularly for those with excessive abdominal fat but normal BMI or muscular individuals with high BMI.
The prevalence of obesity is
rising in India
, and by
, India may surpass China in some obesity categories.
The number of
obese children
is particularly alarming, as they are likely to grow into obese adults.
Studies indicate that
childhood and adolescent obesity
has increased by
244% in the last 30 years
and is projected to rise by
121% in the next 30 years
Obesity significantly increases the risk of
lifestyle diseases
, including:
Type-2 diabetes
Heart ailments
Certain cancers
In countries with aging populations and lower birth rates, managing obesity-related chronic illnesses will become more challenging and expensive.
Aging patients with obesity require more surgeries and incur higher treatment costs.
Obesity increases susceptibility to infections and severe diseases (e.g., COVID-19).
One major driver of the obesity epidemic is the shift in dietary patterns, with an increase in:
Calorie-dense foods high in sugar, salt, and fats
Processed foods with long shelf lives replacing traditional diets
Multinational food and beverage corporations have moved investments from high-income to low- and middle-income countries, where regulations are weaker.
Between 2009 and 2019, the largest growth in per capita sales of ultra-processed foods was seen in Cameroon, India, and Vietnam.
Solutions to Address Obesity
Promoting Traditional Food Systems
Supporting local agriculture and food distribution to counter corporate-driven food systems.
Introducing additional taxes on unhealthy products, such as sugary beverages.
Strengthening Healthcare Responses
Investing in clinical management and treatment of obesity and related conditions.
Developing national policies to combat obesity (currently, only 40% of countries have such policies, with even lower adoption in low- and middle-income nations).
Expanding Obesity Intervention Research
Most obesity intervention studies focus on high-income countries, necessitating research in low-income regions.
Advancing Medical Treatments
New obesity drugs (e.g., semaglutide and terzapatide) show promise.
Past obesity drugs had significant side effects, limiting their use.
Cost and access remain challenges, but cheaper generic versions may improve availability.

**********Women in Judiciary - Progress, Challenges, and the Path Ahead
Context:
Women in law have made significant progress in India over the last century. Cornelia Sorabji became the first woman lawyer in 1924.
The number of women lawyers and judges has increased,
but representation in higher judiciary remains low.
Challenges in Higher Judiciary
Glass ceiling in High Courts (HCs)
Women constitute
only 14.27%
(109 out of 764) of High Court judges.
Eight High Courts have just
one-woman
judge, while Uttarakhand, Meghalaya, and Tripura have
none
Allahabad High Court
, the largest High Court, has only three women judges (2%).
Women judges are
appointed at an
older age
(average 53 years for women vs. 51.8 years for men), reducing their chances of reaching senior positions.
Only the Gujarat High Court has a woman Chief Justice.
Underrepresentation in the Supreme Court (SC)
Currently, there are
only two
women judges (Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice Bela Trivedi) in the Supreme Court.
Justice Bela Trivedi’s
retirement in June 2025 will leave only one-woman judge.
No woman has been appointed
to the Supreme Court
since 2021
, while 28 men have been appointed
Only one woman
has been directly elevated
from the Bar
to the Supreme Court, compared to nine men.
Barriers to women’s appointment
Common justifications:
Lack of eligible women candidates, lack of seniority, or women’s unwillingness.
Systemic gender bias and deep-rooted inequality
restrict women’s opportunities.
Women face
higher scrutiny
than men in judicial appointments.
The collegium system is
opaque, lacks clear criteria
, and is male-dominated.
Government reluctance:
Since 2020, nine women recommended for High Courts were not confirmed; five were rejected outright.
Need for Gender Equality in Judiciary
A gender-balanced judiciary
enhances legitimacy, inclusivity, and public confidence
Women’s representation ensures courts reflect the
diversity of society and deliver more balanced judgments.
Steps Towards Equality
Reforming the collegium system:
Introducing transparent selection processes and clear
merit-based criteria
. Creating
a structured process for lawyers
to apply for judgeship.
Prioritizing gender diversity:
Ensuring at least one-third
, if not half, of the higher judiciary comprises women.
Gender diversity
should be considered alongside state, caste, and religious representation.
Appointing a diverse and independent judiciary to
uphold constitutionalism and rule of law.
Normalizing women’s representation
Gender balance
should be a stated judicial objective in appointments.
Women judges should be
appointed in sufficient numbers
so their presence is normalized, not seen as exceptional.
As Justice Indira Banerjee stated, women’s appointments should not require special attention—they should be a
regular occurrence.
Conclusion
As India celebrates 75 years of the Supreme Court, a
transformative shift
towards gender equality in the judiciary is necessary.
A transparent, inclusive, and merit-driven
judicial appointment system is key to ensuring gender-balanced constitutional courts.

**********Supreme Court limited the power of arrest for officers under CGST, Customs Acts
Why in news?
The Supreme Court, in Radhika Agarwal v. Union of India, ruled that officials exercising arrest, search, and seizure powers under the
Customs Act, 1962, and the CGST Act, 2017
, must adhere to the same restrictions as police under the
CrPC, 1973
This aims to curb misuse of these provisions. The ruling aligns with the Court’s broader effort to limit prosecuting agencies' powers, as seen in Arvind Kejriwal v. Directorate of Enforcement (2025), where the SC set conditions for legal arrests under the
PMLA, 2002
, and extended them to Customs and CGST Act cases.
What’s in today’s article?
Exercising Police Powers
Power of Arrest
Key Highlights of the Judgement
The Supreme Court clarified that while officials under the Customs Act and CGST Act are not police officers, they exercise similar investigative powers, including arrest, search, seizure, and interrogation.
Limitations on Power
The Court ruled that these officials cannot exceed the powers of a police officer in charge of a police station and must follow the same procedural restrictions.
Applicability of CrPC
The Court explained that
Sections 4 and 5 of the CrPC
apply to special laws unless the special act explicitly overrides them.
This ensures that CrPC provisions govern arrests under the Customs and CGST Acts where no contrary provisions exist.
Rights of the Arrested Person
Customs and CGST officers must adhere to key procedural safeguards, including:
Presentation before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest.
Informing a family member or friend about the arrest.
Allowing the arrestee to have an advocate present in the vicinity during interrogation.
Under
Section 104(4) of the Customs Act
, certain offences, such as smuggling prohibited goods or evading customs duty over ₹50 lakh, are
cognizable
, allowing a customs officer to arrest without a warrant.
Section 104(5)
classifies all other offences as
non-cognizable
, requiring a magistrate’s approval for arrest and investigation.
Similarly,
Section 132 of the CGST Act
distinguishes between cognizable and non-cognizable offences, prescribing punishments accordingly.
Safeguards Against Arbitrary Arrest
In Arvind Kejriwal v. Directorate of Enforcement (2025), the SC ruled that arrest without a warrant is an extreme power, requiring strict safeguards under Section 19 of the PMLA.
These include:
Possession of material evidence before arrest.
A recorded "reason to believe" that the person is guilty.
Informing the arrestee of the grounds for arrest to allow legal recourse.
The SC extended these safeguards to Customs and CGST officials in
, warning that unchecked arrest powers could violate constitutional rights.
Material in Possession
The SC held that arrests can only be made if the officer has material evidence supporting their belief in the arrestee’s guilt.
They must document their reasoning in writing and cannot ignore evidence that may exonerate the accused.
In Radhika Agarwal,
the SC emphasized that mere suspicion is insufficient for an arrest
Reasons to Believe
The officer must record in writing their “reasons to believe” that the arrestee is guilty, ensuring that the decision is linked to actual case material.
While courts cannot evaluate the merits of these reasons, they can check if they are clear and logically connected to the case.
The SC clarified that even though the Customs Act and CGST Act do not explicitly require this, it is an implicit necessity due to their power to authorize cognizable arrests.
Providing Grounds of Arrest
The SC ruled that the arrestee must be informed of the reasons for their arrest, including the officer’s “reason to believe” in their guilt.
This ensures that the accused can effectively challenge the arrest or apply for bail. Without this, the arrestee would be at a legal disadvantage.
The court in Radhika Agarwal reaffirmed this principle, ensuring procedural fairness.
Retaining Arrest Powers
The Supreme Court refused to strike down the powers of arrest under the CGST and Customs Acts, as requested by the petitioners.
Coercion to Pay Taxes
The SC acknowledged concerns that tax officials misuse arrest powers to compel assessees to pay overdue taxes under the threat of detention.
It ruled that such coercion is illegal and impermissible.
Legal Remedies for Affected Individuals
The court held that individuals who were forced or threatened into paying taxes can approach the courts to seek a refund of the amount deposited under duress.
Additionally, the concerned tax officials may face disciplinary action.
Guidelines to Prevent Misuse
To curb such practices, the SC directed the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) to form guidelines ensuring that taxpayers are not threatened with arrest in tax recovery matters.

**********[10th March 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Closing the gender gap in the higher judiciary
Polity
PYQ Relevance:
)  Discuss the desirability of greater representation to women in the higher judiciary to ensure diversity, equity and inclusiveness.
(UPSC CSE 2021)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on the
women in the higher judiciary (2021),
appointment of judges of higher judiciary
(2017).
Women in law have made significant progress in India over the past 100 years. Cornelia Sorabji became the first woman lawyer to practice in 1924. Since then, the number of women lawyers has increased, with many becoming Senior Advocates and judges in lower courts. However, their representation in the higher judiciary remains very low.
Today’s editorial highlights the reasons for the low representation of women in the Indian judiciary. This content is useful for GS Papers 1 and 2 in the UPSC Mains exam.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
The gender gap in India’s judiciary is evident in the low representation of women, especially in higher courts.
What is the status of women in the Indian Judiciary?
Supreme Court:
Women make up about 9.3% of judges in the Supreme Court, with only a few women judges currently serving.
High Courts:
As of August 2024, women constitute about 14% of High Court judges, with only 106 women judges out of a total of 754 judges across all High Courts. There are only two women Chief Justices among all High Courts.
Subordinate Judiciary:
Women have a higher representation in subordinate courts, constituting about 36.3% of judges as of recent data.
What are the main reasons for the underrepresentation of women in the higher judiciary in India?
Systemic Gender Bias and Stereotypes:
Women are often viewed as less capable of handling complex legal matters or leadership roles.
Example:
Justice Indira Banerjee, a former Supreme Court judge, highlighted how women must work harder to prove their competence compared to male counterparts.
Opaque Collegium System:
The collegium lacks transparency in the selection process and does not prioritize gender diversity.
Since 2021, 28 judges have been appointed to the Supreme Court, but none of them have been women.
Limited Senior Women Advocates:
Fewer women reach the level of Senior Advocate, which reduces the pool of candidates for higher judicial positions.
Only one woman, Justice Indu Malhotra, has been elevated directly from the Bar to the Supreme Court in its history.
Delayed Appointments and Age Disparity:
Women are appointed to the Bench later than men, limiting their tenure and chances of becoming Chief Justices.
The average appointment age for women is 53 years, while for men, it is 51.8 years.
Government’s Selective Confirmation:
Women’s names recommended by the collegium are more likely to be delayed or rejected by the government.
Since 2020, nine women were recommended for High Court appointments, but five of these names were rejected.
What are the steps taken by the Indian government?
Reservation for Women in Lower Judiciary:
Several states like Bihar, Rajasthan, and Andhra Pradesh have introduced
30-35% reservations
for women in the lower judiciary to encourage female participation at the entry level.
Bihar introduced a
for women in judicial services to increase their representation.
Promotion of Gender Sensitization:
The government supports initiatives to
train judges
and judicial staff on gender sensitivity and equality.
The National Judicial Academy conducts
gender sensitization workshops
for judicial officers.
Encouragement of Collegium Recommendations:
The government has urged the
to consider
when recommending names for judicial appointments.
Law Minister
has emphasized the need for more women judges in
parliamentary discussions
Increased Representation in Policy Discussions:
The government includes
women’s voices
in law commissions and
judicial reform committees
Justice R. Banumathi was part of the
on criminal law reforms focusing on gender issues.
How can the collegium system be reformed to ensure greater transparency and gender diversity in judicial appointments?
Establish Clear and Transparent Selection Criteria:
Implement
publicly available guidelines
specifying the qualifications, experience, and evaluation methods for judicial appointments.
United Kingdom’s Judicial Appointments Commission
uses clear, published criteria to promote transparency and diversity in judicial selection.
Mandate Gender Representation in Recommendations:
Introduce a
formal quota
or commitment to ensuring that
at least one-third
of the recommended candidates are women.
Countries like
Canada
follow a
diversity mandate
to ensure that judicial appointments reflect gender and ethnic representation.
Open Application Process for Judicial Aspirants:
Allow
eligible lawyers
to apply for judgeship through a transparent process rather than relying solely on collegium nominations.
South Africa
invites applications publicly and conducts
open interviews
, ensuring broader participation, including women candidates.
Way forward:
Institutionalize Gender Diversity in Judicial Appointments:
Implement a binding policy requiring the collegium to prioritize gender diversity, ensuring a minimum percentage of women in judicial recommendations. This can be reinforced by periodic audits and public reports on gender representation.
Mentorship and Capacity Building for Women Lawyers:
Establish structured mentorship programs to support women lawyers in advancing to senior positions and encourage their participation in judicial roles. This should include targeted training for leadership and judicial skills to expand the pool of qualified women candidates.

**********As imports of semiconductor chips rise, India eyes local production
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Semiconductor Industry;
Why in the News?
At the World Economic Forum in January, Electronics and IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced that India will produce its first locally made semiconductor chip this year.
What is the primary goal of India’s Semicon India Programme?
Reduce Import Dependency
: To decrease reliance on foreign countries for semiconductor chips used in electronics, automobiles, and communication devices.
Boost Domestic Manufacturing and Innovation
: To establish a strong domestic ecosystem for semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP).
Example
: Construction of the
Dholera semiconductor fabrication facility
in Gujarat by Tata Electronics in collaboration with Taiwan’s
Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation
Enhance India’s Position in the Global Supply Chain
: To integrate India into the global semiconductor value chain and attract investments from global tech giants.
: The
Tata Semiconductor Assembly and Test
facility in
Morigaon
, Assam, is part of India’s effort to develop advanced chip packaging capabilities and reduce external reliance.
How will it reduce import dependency on semiconductor chips?
Local Production of Semiconductor Chips:
Domestic manufacturing of chips will reduce the need to import critical components used in electronics and communication.
: India’s first
indigenously manufactured semiconductor chip
is expected to be produced in
2024
, cutting reliance on imports from countries like
China
South Korea
Building Fabrication (Fab) Facilities:
Establishing semiconductor fabrication plants allows India to produce advanced chips domestically.
Dholera fabrication facility
Tata Electronics,
will reduce the need for importing high-end chips.
Developing Assembly, Testing, and Packaging (ATP) Capabilities:
Setting up ATP units enables India to process raw semiconductor wafers into finished products locally.
, Assam, will handle large-scale chip assembly and packaging, decreasing dependence on foreign ATP services.
Diversifying Supply Chains and Strengthening Indigenous Innovation:
Promoting research and development will encourage innovation in chip design and technology.
: Investments in
EDA software
(Electronic Design Automation) and
Core IP
(patents) will enable India to design proprietary chips instead of relying on external technologies.
Attracting Global and Domestic Investments:
Incentives and policy support under the Semicon India Programme will attract both domestic and foreign semiconductor companies to manufacture locally.
: Government partnerships with industry leaders like
Foxconn
encourage private investment in chip manufacturing, reducing future import needs
Where are the major semiconductor manufacturing and assembly facilities being constructed under the Semicon India Programme?
Tata-PSMC Semiconductor Fab, Dholera, Gujarat

Why has the actual spending under the Semicon India Programme consistently fallen?
Delays in Project Approvals
: Lengthy evaluation and approval processes for semiconductor projects have slowed fund disbursement. For instance, the Tata and Micron projects faced regulatory and environmental clearance delays.
High Capital-Intensive Nature
: Semiconductor manufacturing requires significant upfront investment, and the government has struggled to allocate sufficient funds. For example, the revised estimate for FY24 dropped to ₹1,503.36 crore from the budgeted ₹3,000 crore due to financial constraints.
Limited Domestic Expertise
: India’s lack of advanced technological expertise in areas like chip design and fabrication has slowed implementation, resulting in underutilized budgets.
Complex Global Partnerships
: Collaboration with international firms, such as Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, involves lengthy negotiations and compliance with global standards, delaying fund utilization.
Infrastructure Bottlenecks
: Inadequate supporting infrastructure (like power and water supply) at manufacturing sites has caused delays. For example, the Dholera facility required significant investments in infrastructure before full-scale construction could begin.
Way forward:
Streamline Approval Processes and Policy Support:
Implement faster clearance mechanisms and provide consistent policy incentives to accelerate project approvals and fund disbursement.
Invest in Skill Development and Infrastructure:
Enhance domestic expertise through specialized training programs and improve infrastructure at manufacturing hubs to ensure timely project execution.
