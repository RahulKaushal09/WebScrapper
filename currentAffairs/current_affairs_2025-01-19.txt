**********What is Dark Oxygen?
Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen, have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon.
About Dark Oxygen:
It is the
that is being
produced thousands of feet below the ocean
without any light or photosynthesis.
Why is the discovery important?
Until now
, it was
thought that oxygen
created only through photosynthesis
, a process that
requires sunlight
Oceanic plankton, drifting plants, algae, and some bacteria are the primary elements attributed to the production of oxygen in the ocean. All these organisms are capable of photosynthesis.
However, in this case, oxygen is not being produced by plants. It
comes out of polymetallic nodules
that are similar in resemblance to lumps of coal.
These nodules, made up of metals like manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and lithium, can
generate oxygen through electrochemical activity
even in the
absence of light.
They
split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

**********What is a ‘Planet parade’?
Recently, four planets in our solar system namely Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars have formed a breathtaking arc across the night sky and created a rare phenomenon known as ‘planet parade’.
About Planet Parade:
It refers to a situation when
several planets
in our solar system are
visible in the night sky
, at the same time.
This planetary meet-up, also
known as a conjunction
, makes the two planets appear close together or even touch in the Earth's night sky.
This phenomenon is more an illusion of perspective rather than the planets being in a perfect line in space.
Planets have different motions in the sky. They move at different rates compared to the other stars.
Not all of them are visible in the sky everyday, but sometimes a position comes about so that many or all the planets are visible at the same time, or within a few hours of each other.
According to NASA, such events, especially those involving four or more planets, are noteworthy and
do not occur annually.

**********Why Are Fertility Levels Declining in India?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Declining Fertility in India (Reasons, Implications, Way Forward, etc.)
Introduction:
A global demographic analysis conducted by the
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021
highlights a significant decline in fertility levels worldwide, including in India.
The report reveals a dramatic drop in India's
Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
from
6.18 in the 1950s
1.9 in 2021
, below the replacement level of 2.1.
Projections suggest this rate could fall to
1.04 by 2100
, signalling major socio-economic implications.
Reasons for Declining Fertility in India:
Increased Female Literacy and Workforce Participation
Women’s empowerment and higher educational attainment have contributed significantly to the decline in fertility rates.
Changing Societal Attitudes
Late marriages or choosing not to marry are becoming more common as women prioritize careers and financial independence over traditional roles.
Infertility and Abortions
Rising rates of infertility in men and women and increased abortion rates are also contributing factors.
Migration
Many young individuals move abroad for higher education and employment, often settling there and raising families outside India.
Urbanization and Modern Aspirations
With urbanization, families are opting for fewer children to maintain economic and social aspirations.
Regional Implications:
Southern States
Kerala
and other southern states witnessed demographic transitions earlier than the rest of India, achieving replacement-level fertility in the late 20th century.
Challenges include:
Ageing Population
: The elderly population is rapidly increasing, surpassing the younger demographic.
Shrinking Workforce
: Youth migration for better prospects has left gaps in the local labor market.
Healthcare Demands
: There is an increased burden on healthcare systems and social security to support the elderly.
Kerala’s Specific Case:
Labour Market
: High labor wages and quality of life attract migrant workers from other states, making up about
one-sixth
of the population by 2030.
Health Challenges
: Delayed motherhood leads to older mothers and higher pregnancy-related morbidities.
Global Context:
Countries like
South Korea
showcase the challenges of reversing fertility declines.
Despite heavy investments in pro-natalist policies, South Korea's fertility rate fell from
0.78 in 2022
0.73 in 2023
, underscoring the difficulty of reversing demographic trends once they set in.
Future Implications for India:
Economic Impacts
A shrinking workforce may hinder economic growth.
Increased healthcare costs due to the ageing population.
Social Challenges
Rising dependency ratios could strain families and welfare systems.
Reduced innovation and productivity due to fewer young workers.
Way Forward:
Socio-Economic Policies
Policies focusing on economic growth, job creation, and support for the youth can help mitigate the effects of declining fertility rates.
Leveraging the Elderly Population
Tap into the potential of senior citizens through skill development and involvement in economic activities.
Support for Families
Provide incentives for young couples to have children, such as tax benefits, childcare support, and housing subsidies.
Conclusion:
India's declining fertility rates signal a demographic shift with long-term socio-economic implications.
Proactive policies that address economic, healthcare, and social challenges are crucial to adapting to this transformation.
Learning from global experiences and focusing on sustainable development will ensure that India navigates these challenges effectively.

**********RBI's New Strategy on Rupee Depreciation
Why in News?
RBI appears to have
eased its control over the rupee, allowing it to depreciate
against the US dollar over the last month.
This marks
a departure from its earlier stance
of tightly managing the rupee to curb sharp declines, a strategy prominent until late 2024.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Key Developments in Rupee Depreciation
Impact of Depreciation
Factors Influencing the Rupee’s Future
Conclusion
Key Developments in Rupee Depreciation:
Significant depreciation:
The rupee, which hovered around
84-85 per dollar,
hit its historic low of 86.70 on January 13, 2025, marking its steepest single-day fall in two years.
Since November 1, 2024, the rupee has depreciated by 2.6%.
Possible shift in RBI’s strategy:
The RBI’s reduced intervention points to an increased tolerance for rupee depreciation,
aligning it with market forces and easing pressure on reserves
Analysts suggest the RBI’s approach of allowing a wider range for the rupee is prudent,
reducing resource expenditure
Market experts, however, believe it is too early to attribute this change to the new RBI Governor, Sanjay Malhotra, who took charge on December 11, 2024.
Reduced intervention:
The rupee’s fall indicates a potential recalibration in the RBI’s intervention strategy, driven by the strengthening dollar and the
overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate (REER).
is a measure of a country's currency value relative to a group of other currencies, adjusted for inflation. It's used to assess a country's external balance and economic health.
Impact of Depreciation:
Forex reserves:
India’s foreign exchange reserves
declined
by $79 billion since September 2024 to $625.87 billion by January 10, 2025.
The fall was attributed to
dollar sales to manage the rupee
and foreign investor withdrawals amounting to over ₹1,43,000 crore.
Market liquidity deficit:
Strong RBI intervention since Q4 FY24 caused a drain in domestic liquidity, pushing the system into deficit despite efforts like cash reserve ratio (CRR) cuts and bond purchases.
Inflationary concerns:
A weaker rupee may exacerbate imported inflation, especially for oil products, adding to inflationary pressures projected at 4.5% for Q4 FY24.
Factors Influencing the Rupee’s Future:
Dollar strength:
The rupee’s trajectory depends on whether the US dollar strengthens further or stabilizes.
Expectations hinge on the impact of Donald Trump’s presidency
, with potential policy shifts on immigration, taxes, and tariffs influencing the dollar’s strength.
Predicted levels of rupee:
Analysts expect the rupee to
depreciate further
to around 87 per dollar by March 2025, depending on global market dynamics and Trump’s policy actions.
Conclusion:
The RBI’s recalibrated stance on the rupee
reflects a strategic shift to balance market stability and resource conservation.
While the long-term implications remain uncertain, this approach could allow for better alignment with global currency trends while addressing liquidity concerns domestically.

It is a Central Sector Scheme of Ministry of Panchayati Raj.
It a collaborative effort of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, State Panchayati Raj Departments, State Revenue Departments & Survey of India.
It was nation-wide launched on National Panchayati Raj Day, 24th April 2021.
Aim
This Scheme is a reformative step towards establishment of clear ownership of property in rural inhabited areas.
It does so by:
mapping of land parcels using drone technology and
providing ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners with issuance of legal ownership cards (Property cards/Title deeds) to the property owners.
Objectives
Creation of accurate land records for rural planning and reduce property related disputes.
To bring financial stability to the citizens in rural India by enabling them to use their property as a financial asset for taking loans and other financial benefits.
Determination of property tax, which would accrue to the GPs directly in States where it is devolved or else, add to the State exchequer.
Creation of survey infrastructure and GIS maps that can be leveraged by any department for their use.
To support in preparation of better-quality Gram Panchayat Development Plan (
GPDP)
by making use of GIS maps.
Broad areas of impact
Inclusive Society
There is a link between access to property rights and improvement in socio-economic standards of vulnerable population in villages.
The SVAMITVA Scheme aims to develop this link.
Land Governance
Lack of clearly demarcated Abadi area has led to high number of land-conflict cases.
The scheme aims to address the root cause for disputes at local level.
Sustainable Habitats
High-resolution digital maps for better GPDP will lead to improvement across infrastructure.
Economic Growth
The key outcome is to help people monetize their property as collateral.
Furthermore, a boost to India’s economic growth through streamlining of Property tax, in States where it is levied leading to increase in investments and ease of doing business.
Highlighted economic potential of SVAMITVA Scheme
PM Modi emphasized the role of property cards as a "guarantee of economic security."
Legal property documents have enabled lakhs of people, including small and medium farmers, to secure bank loans and start businesses.
The property cards are addressing long-standing issues of illegal occupation and court disputes, particularly benefiting Dalit, backward, and tribal families.
Nationwide implementation is expected to unlock economic activity worth ₹100 lakh crore.
Status
Nearly
50% of India's 6 lakh villages have been surveyed by drones since the scheme's launch in 2020, benefiting 2.25 crore people with legal property documents
Global Context and Property Rights
The Prime Minister cited a UN study and a renowned economist’s book, explaining how lack of legal property rights renders villagers' assets as “dead capital,” restricting their economic potential.
Advancements in Land Digitization and Drone Surveys
23 crore Bhu-Aadhaar (ULPIN - unique land parcel identification number) numbers have been issued as part of foundational systems for village development.
Approximately 98% of land records have been digitized, and most land maps are now available digitally.
Drone surveys have been completed in over 3.17 lakh villages (92% of the target villages), with full saturation achieved in regions like Puducherry, Tripura, Goa, and Haryana.

**********The trouble with disposing Bhopal’s Union Carbon waste
Why in news?
On January 2, Madhya Pradesh authorities relocated 358 tonnes of hazardous waste from the defunct Union Carbide facility in Bhopal to the Pithampur industrial area in Dhar district.
This action followed a Madhya Pradesh High Court order from December 3, 2024, which set a four-week deadline to dispose of the waste, nearly 40 years after the Bhopal gas disaster that killed over 4,000 people and injured thousands.
What’s in today’s article?
Union Carbide waste disposal
Is the Waste Harmful?
What’s Next for Hazardous Waste Disposal?
About
It is one of the world's worst industrial accidents, occurred on the night of
December 2-3, 1984
, in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.
What Happened?
A highly toxic gas,
methyl isocyanate (MIC)
, leaked from a pesticide plant owned by Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL).
The leak exposed over 500,000 residents to the gas, leading to immediate fatalities and long-term health complications.
Reasons for the Disaster
Poor Maintenance
: Safety systems, like gas scrubbers and cooling systems, were either non-functional or inadequate.
Negligence
: Lack of proper training for workers and failure to follow safety protocols.
Cost-Cutting Measures
: Union Carbide had reduced staff and safety standards to lower operational costs.
Design Flaws
: Faulty plant design increased the risk of gas leaks.
Storage Issues
: Excessive quantities of MIC were stored at the plant, contrary to safety guidelines.
About the news:
Hazardous waste from the defunct Union Carbide factory was transported in sealed container trucks from Bhopal to the Pithampur industrial area in Dhar district, 250 km away, for disposal.
Bhopal Gas Tragedy Waste Disposal: Current Status
Background
Union Carbide plant was originally set up to manufacture fertilizers.
The waste at the site consists of fertilizer ingredients that have remained untreated for decades.
Planned Disposal
Madhya Pradesh government planned to incinerate 377 tons of hazardous waste at a
treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF)
in Pithampur.
The waste was packaged and labelled per Hazardous Waste Management Rules and transported in secure containers.
Challenges
Protests by locals in Pithampur over fears of harmful emissions from incineration have delayed the disposal process.
High Court Intervention
On January 6, 2025, the Madhya Pradesh High Court gave the State government six weeks to
safely dispose
of the waste.
This order came after the State has sought time to raise public awareness about the disposal methods and their environmental and health safeguards.
Why Pithampur Was Chosen for Waste Disposal
Previous Attempts
In 2007, the MP government tried disposing of the waste at an incinerator-equipped TSDF in Ankleshwar, Gujarat, but the facility declined.
Supreme Court Selection
In 2012, the Supreme Court identified the
Pithampur TSDF
in MP as the most suitable site for disposing of the hazardous waste.
The facility, equipped with both a landfill and an incinerator, is the only TSDF in the state, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
CPCB Endorsement
In 2013, the CPCB submitted an affidavit to the Supreme Court attesting to the Pithampur TSDF’s capacity to handle waste from the Union Carbide plant.
Composition of the Waste
The trial waste included: 4.8 tonnes of
excavated waste;
1.6 tonnes of
semi-processed residue;
1.3 tonnes of
naphthol waste;
carbaryl residue;
0.8 tonnes of
reactor residue.
Naphthol
is a precursor for carbaryl, the insecticide produced by the Union Carbide plant.
Water Quality Concerns
A December 2024 CPCB report found that water samples near the Pithampur TSDF showed
higher-than-permissible levels
of:
Its Colour, chloride, sulphate, and fluoride concentrations
Hardness and total dissolved solids (TDS)
These issues were found in two open wells near the landfill but were attributed to
general groundwater quality
, not the TSDF operations.
Health Impact Claims
Media reports alleging higher rates of
skin diseases
around the TSDF were countered by:
Surveys from
AIIMS Bhopal
Indian Council of Medical Research
, which found lower-than-average cases of skin and respiratory ailments compared to national levels.
Incineration Residue and Environmental Risks
Reports in 2015 indicated that incineration generated
four times more ash and residue
than the combusted waste.
The residue was disposed of in the TSDF landfill with protections against leachates.
According to the
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
, composite liners at hazardous waste landfills degrade over time and require periodic replacement to prevent environmental contamination.
Temporary Halt in Incineration
MP government has delayed waste incineration due to
local protests
and safety concerns.
Public Awareness Efforts
Authorities plan to build
public confidence
in the disposal process by addressing misinformation.
50 master trainers
(science teachers, professors, and officials) will be trained to educate locals on the waste and disposal process.
Upcoming Trial Run
A new trial run will incinerate
90 kg of waste
1,200º C
Scientific rationale:
Organic compounds like 1-naphthol are destroyed at 590–650º C.
Hazardous waste incinerators at 980–1,200º C could eliminate organic contaminants effectively.
Full-Scale Incineration Plan
If emissions remain within legal limits:
Waste will be incinerated in
batches of 270 kg
over three months.
If emissions exceed limits:
Batch sizes will be reduced, and disposal may extend to
nine months
Next Steps
The next
High Court hearing
is scheduled for
February 18, 2025
, to review progress and decide further actions.
