CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (CBI)
Prelims & Mains – Polity
The Supreme Court recently upheld the maintainability of a suit filed by the State of West Bengal accusing the Centre of “constitutional overreach” and violation of federalism by unilaterally employing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) without the State’s prior consent.
West Bengal had withdrawn its general consent to CBI investigations way back on November 16, 2018.
About Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), functioning under Dept. of Personnel, Ministry of Personnel, Pension & Public Grievances, Government of India, is the premier investigating police agency in India.
It is also the nodal police agency in India, which coordinates investigation on behalf of Interpol Member countries.
History of CBI
The Central Bureau of Investigation traces its origin to the Special Police Establishment (SPE) which was set up in 1941 by the Government of India.
The functions of the SPE then were to investigate cases of bribery and corruption in transactions with the War & Supply Dept. Of India during World War II.
Even after the end of the War, the need for a Central Government agency to investigate cases of bribery and corruption by Central Government employees was felt. The Delhi Special Police Establishment Act was therefore brought into force in 1946.
CBI derives power to investigate from theDelhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. Section 2 of the Act vests DSPE with jurisdiction to investigate offences in the Union Territories only.
However, the jurisdiction can be extended by the Central Government to other areas including Railway areas and States under Section 5(1) of the Act, provided the State Government accords consent under Section 6 of the Act.
As per Section 3 of the Act, Special Police Establishment is authorised to investigate only those cases, which are notified by the Central Government from time to time.
The DSPE acquired its popular current name, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), through a Home Ministry resolution in
As the CBI, over the years, established a reputation for impartiality and competence, demands were made on it to take up investigation of more cases of conventional crime such as murder, kidnapping, terrorist crime, etc.
Apart from this, even the Supreme court and the various High Courts of the country also started entrusting such cases for investigation to the CBI on petitions filed by aggrieved parties.

FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
The taking of the Bastille on July 14, 1789 signalled the beginning of the French Revolution.French Revolution has inspired the Indian Constituent Assembly.
A year ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi graced the Bastille Day celebrations in France on July 14, 2023. The Prime Minister was on a state visit and shared the dais with then French President Emmanuel Macron.
What is Bastille Day
Bastille Day is celebrated in France as the beginning of the French Revolution in which the Regime of the absolutist Bourbon monarchy was overthrown in favour of Republicanism.
On July 14, 1789, the people of Paris broke the walls of Bastille Prison and freed the inmates. This was seen as the ultimate end of the power of monarchy.
Later, a National Assembly was set up which declared the Rights of Man and Citizen in August. It was here that we hear and see for the first-time the ideals of the French Republic-“Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité” (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity).
India and the French revolution
India, like several other countries that underwent decolonization, embraced the slogan dearly and was inspired by the French Revolution since the time of British occupation.
Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore in the late eighteenth century, is famous for planting the Tree of Liberty in his capital Seringapatam and calling himself  ‘Citizen Tipoo’.
Later on, the Indian Constituent Assembly adopted the first few lines of the Preamble to India’s Constitution from the French Revolution.
The Preamble grants the Liberty- of thoughts, expression, belief, faith and worship, Equality of – status and opportunity (to its citizens), and, to promote among them all, Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation.
The idea of Republic
By overthrowing its monarchy, the French broke the myth of the invincibility of monarchies across the world.
Republic means reserving the highest office of the state for an elected representative, symbolising governance by the people themselves.
The Constituent Assembly on the Preamble began its debates in October 1949. Many members wanted the inclusion of ‘God’ or ‘Gandhi’ in the Preamble.
Eventually, it was all negated in favour of the version submitted by the Drafting Committee of the Assembly. The idea of Equality was already codified by this time. Articles 14,15,16 and numerous others had reasonably demonstrated it.
For instance, India abolished titles (Article 18), introduced universal adult franchise (Article 326) and argued for equality with principles of equity as the Fundamental Rights of citizens (Articles 14, 15).
Secularism and Fraternity
The Indian Constitution makers took another lesson from France in terms of the idea of Secularism and Fraternity.
Secularism in Indian context is not the absence of religion altogether but presence of all sects and religion in equal terms. Hence, the state provides grants to all religious denominations.

CHROMIUM CONTAMINATION
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Odisha government to supply safe potable drinking water in the different regions where the joint inspection committee had detected contamination of ground water due to chromium pollution.
Hexavalent chromium is recognized to have a negative impact on the human body, both in the short and long term.
About chromium contamination
Chromium is an odorless and tasteless metallic element.
Chromium is found naturally in rocks, plants, soil and volcanic dust, and animals.
The most common forms of chromium that occur in natural waters in the environment are:
Trivalent chromium (chromium-3)
Hexavalent chromium (chromium-6)
Chromium-3 is an essential human dietary element. It is found in many vegetables, fruits, meats, grains, and yeast.
Chromium-6 occurs naturally in the environment from the erosion of natural chromium deposits. It can also be produced by industrial processes. There are demonstrated instances of chromium being released to the environment by leakage, poor storage, or inadequate industrial waste disposal practices.
The sources of chromium in water include industrial wastes from leather and tanning, petroleum and ore refining, electroplating and pulp industries. These industries contribute liquid and solid forms of chromium to subsurface water. The tanneries play a significant part in occurrence of chromium in groundwater.
Hexavalent chromium is dangerous and can easily dissolve in water, whereas Trivalent chromium is stable and harmless in nature .
The hexavalent chromium causes health effects due to its mobility, high solubility and oxidizing behaviour.
Health issues like pulmonary congestion, vomiting, diarrhea and liver damage are commonly caused by hexavalent chromium.

**********Why States Must Reconsider Their Demand for Special Category Status
Context
Special Category Status (SCS) has played a crucial role in addressing regional disparities,
its future remains uncertain amidst evolving political and economic landscapes.
Leaders of aspiring states push for SCS for political reasons
without thoroughly assessing the net benefits.
challenge lies in finding a balanced approach
that continues to support underprivileged states while ensuring equitable development across the country.
The Concept of SCS and Role of the National Development Council (NDC) and Finance Commission (FC)
The concept of SCS was
introduced in 1969 during the Fourth Five-Year Plan by the Planning Commission
, aiming to address the disparities in development among Indian states.
NDC played a significant role in this process by providing plan assistance to states
using
the Gadgil formula
, which gave higher weightage to population and economic deprivation.
This
formula ensured that 30 percent of funds were reserved for SCS states.
FC also recognised the importance of SCS
and incorporated it into their budgetary deficit considerations and tax devolution criteria.
These states benefited from a funding model where 90 percent of centrally-sponsored schemes were grants
and the remaining 10 percent were loans, unlike other states which received 60 or 75 percent grants.
Additional Benefits of Special Category Status
Concession in Taxes
SCS states receive significant relief in excise duties
, which are taxes levied on the manufacture of goods within the country.
relief helps local industries by reducing their tax burden
, encouraging industrial development and investment in these states.
Concessions in customs duties,
which are taxes imposed on imported goods,
lower the cost of imported raw materials
and goods for industries in SCS states.
reduction makes it more economical for businesses to operate and expand in these regions
, fostering economic growth.
These lower tax rates make the states more attractive
to both individuals and businesses, encouraging investment and the establishment of new enterprises.
Higher Central Plan Status
SCS states receive 90 percent of the funding for centrally sponsored schemes as grants,
with only 10 percent provided as loans.
In contrast,
other states receive 60 or 75 percent as grants
and the remaining amount as loans.
favourable funding structure greatly reduces the financial burden on SCS states,
enabling them to undertake more development projects.
higher central assistance provides SCS states with greater flexibility
in utilising funds for various developmental projects.
flexibility allows states to tailor the use of funds to address their specific needs
and challenges effectively.
Enhanced Financial Transfers
Finance Commission's criteria for tax devolution have often favoured SCS states,
ensuring a higher share of central taxes is transferred to them.
higher share helps compensate for their developmental lag and geographical disadvantages.
Finance Commission also considers the budgetary deficits of SCS
states more favourably.
consideration results in additional financial support to cover gaps in their budgets,
ensuring they can maintain essential public services and infrastructure projects.
Transition to NITI Aayog and Current Scenario
With the replacement of the Planning Commission by NITI Aayog,
the mechanism for central plan assistance has changed.
Now,
all Centre-to-state transfers are managed through the Finance Commission,
except for specific central sector and centrally sponsored schemes.
While the structural framework has evolved,
the core objective of supporting underprivileged states remains.
transition has introduced a more streamlined and accountable process for fund allocation,
with a focus on performance-based incentives and outcome-oriented funding.
However,
the fundamental benefits that SCS states received in terms of financial support and tax concessions continue to play a crucial role
in their development trajectories.
Recommendations of the 14th and 15th Finance Commissions
Acknowledgment of Demands and Concerns by 14
14th Finance Commission did not consider SCS in its recommendations,
though it acknowledged the demands and concerns of various states.
It proposed higher allocations for northeastern states
, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, continuing the trend of higher grants and lower cost-sharing for central projects.
Special grants were also sanctioned to address specific challenges
faced by these states.
No Mention of SCS in 15
15th Finance Commission did not explicitly mention SCS but allocated 10.5 percent of devolved taxes to the northeastern and hilly states
, accounting for only 5.2 percent of the population.
This decision resulted in lower shares for southern and western states.
Commission also considered factors like ecology and area,
leading to a higher share of divisible taxes for these states.
shift to using the 2011 Census population data, as opposed to the 1971 data, further increased their share
due to higher population growth in SCS states, except Himachal Pradesh.
Challenges and Future Considerations
Political Controversies and Bargaining
One of the most significant challenges with SCS is
its transformation into a tool for political bargaining.
increased presence of regional parties in the central government has intensified demands for SCS
, often driven by political rather than developmental motives.
politicisation of SCS complicates the objective assessment
of which states genuinely need special assistance.
Fiscal Implications
central government faces budgetary constraints
and must balance the need for supporting SCS states with other fiscal responsibilities.
Allocating a significant portion of funds to SCS states can strain the overall budget.
Ensuring equity among states is a challenge
, as other states may perceive the benefits to SCS states as unfair, leading to demands for similar concessions.
can create regional tensions and calls for a re-evaluation of the SCS framework.
Administrative Challenges
that SCS states effectively utilise the funds and benefits provided is crucial and mismanagement
or under utilisation can negate the intended developmental impacts.
There needs to be a robust framework for transparency and accountability
in the allocation and utilisation of funds.
includes regular audits and assessments to ensure that the benefits are reaching the intended targets.
Establishing Clear, Updated Criteria
government should develop an inclusive framework
that considers a wide range of factors, including economic performance, social development indices, and ecological vulnerabilities.
Also,
there is a need to establish a mechanism for regular review
and updating of the criteria to ensure they remain relevant and effective in addressing emerging challenges.
Strengthening Institutional Mechanisms
Strengthening institutional mechanisms
to ensure transparency, accountability, and effective utilisation of
resources is crucial.
Implementing robust monitoring systems
to track the progress and impact of SCS benefits, ensuring they
are used effectively for intended purposes.
Building the capacity of state governments to manage and implement projects efficiently, ensuring that the benefits of SCS are fully realised.
Conclusion
The future of SCS in India depends on addressing its current challenges
and evolving the framework to meet contemporary needs.
By establishing clear, updated criteria, strengthening institutional mechanisms
, and developing regional cooperation,
SCS can continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring balanced regional development.
The focus must remain on equitable growth, transparency, and accountability to achieve the intended socio-economic transformation
of underprivileged states.

Editorial Analysis
**********Control of nodal cyber security watchdog CERT-IN
Why in news?
Two ministries, Information Technology and Home Affairs, are making a strong pitch for the ownership of Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN), the country’s nodal cybersecurity watchdog.
At present, Cert-In comes under the administrative control of the IT Ministry.
What’s in today’s article?
Control of CERT-IN
Conclusion
About
The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) is an organization under the
Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology
, Government of India.
It has been operational since 2004.
As per the Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008, CERT-In has been designated to serve as the national nodal agency responsible:
for responding to computer security incidents as they occur and
for enhancing the security of India's communications and information infrastructure.
Functions
Incident Response
Providing technical assistance and advice to individuals and organizations in case of a cyber incident.
Coordinating responses to security incidents on the national level.
Cyber Security Awareness and Training
Organizing training programs, workshops, and conferences to educate stakeholders about cyber security threats and best practices.
Disseminating information on cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and protective measures.
Vulnerability Handling and Coordination
Identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks.
Coordinating with stakeholders to mitigate the impact of vulnerabilities and advising on preventive measures.
Security Quality Management Services
Offering security quality management services, including risk assessment, penetration testing, and security audits.
Developing guidelines, standards, and policies for the protection of information infrastructure.
Cyber Threat Monitoring
Continuously monitoring cyber threats to the country's information infrastructure.
Providing early warning and alerts on potential and ongoing cyber threats.
Collaboration and Coordination
Collaborating with domestic and international cyber security organizations, law enforcement agencies, and industry partners.
Sharing information and best practices to enhance collective cyber security defenses.
Policy Development and Implementation
Assisting in the formulation of national policies and strategies related to cyber security.
Ensuring the implementation of government policies and regulations pertaining to cyber security.
Research and Development
Engaging in research and development activities to innovate and improve cyber security technologies and methodologies.
Promoting the development of indigenous cyber security solutions.
Few notable works of CERT-IN
CERT-In has been involved in high-profile investigations, such as the 2022 cyberattack on AIIMS Delhi.
It issued a cybersecurity directive in 2022, requiring VPN and cloud service providers to store customer information for five years.
CERT-In handled approximately 1.4 million cybersecurity incidents in 2022, with mitigation of vulnerable services being the most common.
Two key ministries in India, Information Technology (IT) and Home Affairs (MHA), are in a dispute over control of the CERT-IN.
Positions of the Ministries
Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
: Advocates for CERT-In to come under its control to enhance law enforcement capabilities, particularly in cyberspace, given CERT-In's technical expertise and the MHA's enforcement powers.
The MHA believes this integration would streamline cybercrime investigations.
Ministry of Information Technology (IT)
: Argues that CERT-In's role is technical and extends beyond law enforcement, focusing on incident reporting, malware alerts, and advising on security infrastructure improvements.
The IT Ministry emphasizes that CERT-In's technical functions are distinct from investigative powers, which the MHA holds.
Background
CERT-In, under the IT Ministry, performs technical functions like analyzing and disseminating information on cyber incidents, issuing alerts, and coordinating responses.
It does not have investigative powers like search and seizure
The MHA, through the Indian Cyber-crime Coordination Centre (I4C), focuses on cybercrimes and coordination among law enforcement agencies.
Control of CERT-In could provide the MHA with needed technical expertise.
Dispute highlights an associated issue
The dispute is partly due to ambiguous Allocation of Business Rules (AoBR).
These rules
do not designate cybersecurity solely to any one ministry, leading to overlapping responsibilities
among the Prime Minister’s Office, Home Ministry, and IT Ministry.
Globally, CERTs can fall under either the Home office or the IT ministry, depending on the country.
The tussle between the IT Ministry and MHA over CERT-In highlights the evolving challenges in cybersecurity management and the
need for clear delineation of roles and responsibilities among various governmental agencies

**********ED's Power to Arrest
Why in news?
The Supreme Court has granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. A two-judge bench of SC referred some questions on the ED’s power to arrest under Section 19 of the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 to a larger bench.
What’s in today’s article?
Section 19 of the PMLA
Questions raised over ED’s power to arrest under Section 19 of PMLA
Analysis of the remarks made the apex court
About
Section 19 of the PMLA grants the ED Director the authority to arrest individuals.
According to Section 19(1):
if the Director "has on the basis of material in his possession,
reason to believe
(that reason for such belief to be recorded in writing) that any person has been guilty of an offence punishable under this Act, he may arrest such person and shall, as soon as may be, inform him of the grounds for such arrest."
Power of arrest under this section
Under Section 19 of the PMLA, an
ED officer must have "reason to believe," based on the material in their possession, that the accused is guilty of the offence
. This belief must be recorded and communicated to the accused at the time of arrest.
Essentially, the provision states that the arrest has to be on the basis of material in possession of evidence with the ED.
However, at times, the ED emphasizes the phrase "reason to believe" in Section 19.
It contends that the Director's belief, which is subjective and can evolve during the investigation, is sufficient for an arrest without necessarily delving into the materials.
Stricter than ordinary criminal law
This standard under Section 19 of PMLA is stricter than ordinary criminal law, where police can arrest based on reasonable suspicion under Section 41 of the CrPC.
The PMLA also imposes a reverse burden of proof, requiring the accused to prove their innocence, unlike in ordinary law where the prosecution must prove guilt.
For bail under the PMLA, the court must find prima facie that the accused is not guilty.
In the Vijay Madanlal Chaudhary case, the SC upheld the stringent bail provisions.
The Court noted that the narrower power to arrest under the PMLA justified these stricter requirements.
The legal validity
In the 2022 Vijay Madanlal Chaudhary ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Section 19 of the PMLA.
While the court did not address the necessity of arrest or the standard of evidence required (proportionality aspects), it affirmed that the extensive power to arrest is not unconstitutional.
The SC endorsed a key argument by the ED that only high-ranking officials, after recording reasons in writing, can authorize an arrest.
The court noted that granting this power to high-ranking officials, combined with the requirement to provide reasons in writing, ensures reasonableness and minimizes the risk of arbitrariness.
Observations made by the SC
The Supreme Court has clarified the interpretation of "reasons to believe" under Section 19 of the PMLA.
The court held that the
ED must meet a higher standard, requiring reasons that are almost equivalent to "evidence admissible in court" to establish guilt
, rather than just a subjective finding by the ED.
The SC emphasized that the material in possession must lead the designated officer to form an opinion of guilt based on admissible evidence, not on inadmissible evidence.
The court highlighted that arrests must not be arbitrary and must be based on valid "reasons to believe" that adhere to legal parameters.
The Supreme Court emphasized that the clear language of Section 19(1) must be upheld to ensure stringent safeguards against pre-trial arrests during ongoing investigations.
The court distinguished between the power to arrest and the process of framing charges and conducting a trial.
It noted that an individual can face charges and undergo trial while on bail, underscoring that arrest should not be equated with the commencement of trial proceedings.
Need to scrutinize the ED's use of its arrest powers
The Supreme Court did not rule on the legality of Kejriwal's arrest but found sufficient grounds to scrutinize the ED's use of its arrest powers.
The court stated that this issue needs "in-depth consideration" by a larger Bench.
Meanwhile, given that the Delhi CM Kejriwal had been incarcerated for over 90 days, the court ordered his release on bail until the larger Bench addresses the matter.
Necessity for clear guidelines to prevent potential misuse of authority
The ruling, while deferring the key question of when an arrest is legally necessitated to a larger Bench, raises significant concerns about how the ED exercises its extensive powers under the PMLA.
This decision highlights the need for a thorough examination of the ED's arrest procedures and underscores the necessity for clear guidelines to prevent potential misuse of authority.
Raised the bar for arrest by the ED under the PMLA
Arrest, after all, cannot be made arbitrarily and on the whims and fancies of the authorities. It is to be made on the basis of the valid ‘reasons to believe’, meeting the parameters prescribed by the law.

**********The Delhi Urban Land and Immovable Property Records Bill 2024
Why in News?
The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry (MoHUA) is working on a law - the Delhi Urban Land and Immovable Property Records Bill 2024, that would bring all urban land and building records in the national capital under a single Authority.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Major Impediments in the Urban planning in India
What is the Current Situation in the National Capital?
What are the Proposals in the Delhi Urban Land and Immovable Property Records Bill 2024?
What is the Significance of the Delhi Urban Land and Immovable Property Records Bill 2024?
Major Impediments in the Urban planning in India:
According to the NITI Aayog’s ‘Urban Planning Capacity in India’ report, for many major cities
accurate and usable maps do not exist
The Record of Rights (RoR)
in some states are either non-existent or not updated after areas are declared urbanised.
This is because Revenue Departments believe that maintaining urban records is the responsibility of the municipality or urban development authority.
This is a major impediment
in the planning processes as well as planning capacity, since the detailed and robust land records are essential for proper urban planning.
Hence, the spatial plans need to be aligned with land records for the successful execution of the urban planning.
According to the Economic Survey of Delhi 2022-23
, the National Capital Territory (NCT) sprawls over 1,483 sq km, of which 1,114 sq km is designated as urban.
Rural land records are maintained under the Delhi Land Reforms Act 1954 and the Punjab Land Revenue Act 1887.
However, there is currently
no urban land and buildings records law or system
in Delhi. Also,
multiple agencies
are responsible for land in Delhi.
For instance,
The Revenue Department of the Delhi government:
It maintains the RoR.
The NDMC and the MCD:
They maintain the property tax records for their areas.
The Land & Development Office (L&DO) under the MoHUA:
Maintains land records dating back to the establishment of New Delhi by the British in 1911.
The Delhi Development Authority (DDA):
It has records for the land acquired by it for development.
Establishment of a single authority:
The Delhi Urban Land and Immovable Property Records Authority will frame the guidelines for creating and maintaining urban land records.
It will be chaired by the Delhi LG and will include officials from the DDA, MCD, NDMC, Delhi Cantonment Board, the L&DO and Revenue Department as members.
An urban RoR:
The proposed Bill will have provisions for an urban RoR that have the names of all holders, occupants (other than tenants), owners, or mortgagees of the land, or assignees of the rent revenue from it.
With no single custodian for the NCT of Delhi, there are
no uniform records
across various governance and planning typologies, making the
process of property title search extremely cumbersome.
With the enactment of the bill,
all notified urban areas
within the geographical boundaries of the NCT of Delhi will be covered by the Delhi Urban Land and Immovable Property Records Authority.
Since land in Delhi is a central subject under
Article 239AA
of the Constitution, the proposed law will not fundamentally change who controls land policy in the capital.

Why in the News?
The Government of India has decided to observe
every year as
‘Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas.’
National Emergency imposition in India
June 25, 2025
, will mark
fifty years
since the imposition of the Emergency.
The Emergency lasted from
June 25, 1975, to March 21, 1977
It was characterized by the
suspension of civil liberties, press freedom, mass arrests
, the cancellation of elections, and rule by decree.
What was the Emergency?
PM
Indira Gandhi’s government

Opposition
leaders were jailed
fundamental rights
, including freedom of speech and expression,
were curtailed
, leading to
press censorship
federal structure
was effectively
converted into a unitary
one, with the Union controlling state governments.
Parliament
extended its term,
made laws on state subjects
, and extended the Union’s executive powers to the states.
Legal and Constitutional Sanction
Article 352
allowed the
President
to proclaim an emergency if India’s security was threatened by war, external aggression, or armed rebellion.
In 1975, “
internal disturbance
”
was used as grounds
for the Emergency, citing incitements against the police and armed forces.
This was the
only instance
of emergency due to “internal disturbance,”
later removed by the 44th Amendment in 1978.
Article 358
suspended limitations on Article 19
(“Right to freedom”).
Article 359
allowed the President to suspend the right to court enforcement of rights during an emergency.
Political and Social Circumstances: A Timeline
In 1974, the
Navnirman movement
against corruption in Gujarat led to President’s Rule.
Inspired by
Navnirman, a
student movement in Bihar
, led by
Jayaprakash Narayan (JP),
aimed to cleanse the country of corruption and misgovernance.
In May 1974,
George Fernandes
led a massive railway workers’ strike.
On June 5, 1974, JP called for “
Sampoorna Kranti
” (total revolution).
On June 12, 1975,
Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha
of the Allahabad High Court
convicted Indira Gandhi of electoral malpractice.
On June 25, 1975, President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed signed the Proclamation of Emergency, cutting power to major newspapers and informing the Cabinet the next morning.
Impact on Opposition Leaders, Media, and Political Dissenters
Almost all opposition leaders, including JP, were detained under the
Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).
Newspapers faced pre-censorship
, with UNI and PTI merged into a state-controlled agency, Samachar.
More than
250 journalists were jailed
, and The Indian Express resisted by
printing blank spaces
when stories were censored.
Sanjay Gandhi’s “five-point programme”
included forced family planning and slum clearance, leading to forced sterilizations and violent clashes.
Sanjay Gandhi’s “Five-Point Programme”
Sanjay Gandhi, the younger son of then PM, Mrs. Indira Gandhi had come forward with a programme to ‘improve’ the condition of the poor people.
His programme can be divided under five Headings, i.e.
Adult Education.
To abolish Dowry.
To Grow more trees.
Family planning – only two children.
Eradication of caste system.
Legal Changes during the Emergency
With opposition leaders in jail,
Parliament passed amendments barring judicial review
of the Emergency and securing the Prime Minister’s election.
The 42nd Amendment
expanded Union authority over states
and gave Parliament unbridled power to amend the Constitution.
ADM Jabalpur vs. Shivkant Shukla (1976),
the Supreme Court ruled that
detention without trial was legal
during an emergency, with Justice H.R. Khanna dissenting.
Lifting the Emergency and Aftermath
Indira Gandhi lifted the Emergency in
early 1977
, leading to her
defeat in the elections
Janata Party emerged victorious
, with Morarji Desai becoming India’s first non-Congress Prime Minister.

Scientists from the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) have discovered a new species of deep-water dogfish shark, Squalus hima, from the Sakthikulangara fishing harbour in Kerala along the Arabian Sea.
About Squalus hima
Squalus is a
genus of dogfish sharks
in the family
Squalidae
, commonly known as spurdogs, characterized by
smooth dorsal fin spines
The new species, Squalus hima sp. nov., has been
misidentified with S. mitsukurii and S. lalannei
in the past.
differs from other species
by the number of precaudal vertebrae, total vertebrae, teeth count, trunk and head heights, fin structure, and fin colour.
Comparison with Other Species
On the Indian coast,
two species of Squalus
are found from the southwest coast of India.
Squalus hima n.sp
., is very
similar to Squalus lalannei
but differs in many characteristics.
Species in the Squalus megalops group are characterized by an angular short snout, a small mouth almost as wide as the snout, the first dorsal fin origin behind the pectoral fins, and a body without any spots.
Economic and Conservation Implications
Sharks in the genus Squalus and Centrophorus are exploited for their liver oil, which contains high levels of squalene, used in high-end cosmetic and anti-cancer products.
Fishermen from southern India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands harvest these sharks for their liver oil, making conservation of these species critical.

**********Weed control using ‘Cyrtobagus salvinia’ Insect
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
The Sarani reservoir in the Betul district has been successfully cleaned following the release of an exotic beetle to eradicate the invasive weed Salvinia molesta. The weed was completely eliminated within 18 months, transforming the 2,800-acre reservoir.
Case Study: Salvinia Molesta eradication from Sarani Reservoir
Salvinia molesta, an aquatic fern, had overtaken the Sarani reservoir on the Tawa River in Madhya Pradesh.
Locally known as “
Chinese Jhalaar
,” the invasive species was first
noticed in 2018
and covered the reservoir by 2019.
This project is the
largest and most successful experiment
by ICAR-DWR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Directorate of Weed Research).
Initial Challenges
The invasive species had covered water bodies, depleting oxygen and destroying fish populations.
The company initially considered manual removal of the weed, estimated to cost Rs 15 crore.
Manual removal was deemed ineffective due to the likelihood of the weed’s resurgence.
Biological Control using ‘Cyrtobagus salvinia’
ICAR-DWR proposed using the exotic insect
Cyrtobagus salvinia, a
bio-agent from Brazil
, specifically targets Salvinia molesta.
ICAR-DWR, after thorough research and government approvals,
released the insect
into the reservoir in April 2022.
This insect
feeds exclusively
on Salvinia molesta and
dies naturally
once the weed is eradicated, posing no environmental threat.
Within
15 to 18 months
, the insect population
eradicated the weed
About
Establishment:
Founded in 1989 and located in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India.
Mandate:
Focuses on research and development in weed management, aiming for sustainable and environmentally friendly practices.
Research Areas:
Includes weed ecology and biology, herbicide resistance, non-chemical weed management, and weed utilization.
Facilities:
Equipped with modern laboratories, experimental farms, a herbarium, and a comprehensive library.
Economic and Social Benefits
The elimination of Salvinia molesta has relieved fishermen in surrounding villages, restoring their livelihoods.
The infestation had forced many fishermen to migrate and work as laborers due to the loss of fish populations.
With the reservoir clear, fishermen are optimistic about regaining their income through reintroduced fish populations.

**********The PDS impact on household expenditure   
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About PDS and its structural mandate
Mains level:
Imputation of values for food and non-food items
Why in the news?
The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey Data provides an opportunity to analyze the effects of social transfers.
About Public Distribution System (PDS):
The Public Distribution System (PDS) aims to ensure food security by providing subsidized foodgrains to economically vulnerable sections of society. Under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, up to 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population are eligible for subsidized foodgrains.
Foodgrains procured by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) are distributed through a network of Fair Price Shops (FPS).
Its structural mandate:
Procurement and Distribution:
The PDS operates through the procurement of foodgrains by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from farmers at Minimum Support Prices (MSP). These foodgrains are then allocated to states and union territories based on their requirements and distributed to Fair Price Shops (FPS), which deliver subsidized foodgrains to eligible beneficiaries.
Identification and Subsidy:
Beneficiaries are identified based on the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) data, classifying households into Priority Households and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households. Under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, eligible households receive rice at ₹3 per kg, wheat at ₹2 per kg, and coarse grains at ₹1 per kg. The system aims to ensure that food security is maintained for the economically vulnerable sections of society.
Observations made by the HCES:2022-23 report
The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2022-23 provides insights into the coverage of social welfare programs, including the Public Distribution System (PDS).
The survey highlights discrepancies between administrative data and survey estimates due to inclusion and exclusion errors, offering detailed characteristics of households benefiting from these programs.
Note:
Imputation of values for food and non-food items refers to the process of assigning a monetary value to items received by households for free or at a subsidised rate through social welfare programs like the Public Distribution System (PDS) in India.
Purpose:
Imputation is done to estimate the total consumption expenditure of households more accurately. It accounts for the fact that households receive goods (such as foodgrains from PDS) without directly paying for them, thus impacting their overall consumption.
Methodology:
The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and other agencies use statistical methods to assign a value to these items. This involves determining the modal (most common) or percentile prices of the items received, which may vary by state and rural/urban classification.
Types of Items Imputed:
Imputation covers both food and non-food items. In the context of the PDS, it primarily includes foodgrains but can extend to other essential commodities provided through government schemes.
Data Sources:
Data for imputation can come from surveys like the HCES, where households report receiving these items. NSSO surveys typically provide detailed guidelines on how imputation values are derived and applied in their reports.
Impact on Analysis:
Imputing values allows analysts to compute metrics like the Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) accurately, reflecting the true economic status and welfare impact of households.
Implications for Poverty
Economic Relief for Poorer Households:
By providing foodgrains at highly subsidized rates, the PDS reduces the financial burden on poorer households, allowing them to allocate their limited resources to other essential needs.
Enhanced Measurement of Poverty:
Imputing the value of free or subsidised items received through programs like the PDS allows for a more comprehensive assessment of household consumption. Including these imputed values in poverty measurements provides a more accurate reflection of the economic well-being of households.
Policy Insights and Targeting:
Understanding how imputed values impact poverty metrics helps policymakers in targeting social welfare programs more effectively.
Diversification of Diet:
Access to subsidized foodgrains from the PDS allows households to free up resources, potentially enabling them to purchase a more diverse range of nutrient and protein-rich foods such as vegetables, milk, pulses, eggs, fish, and meat
Way forward:
Enhancing Efficiency and Targeting:
Improve the identification and targeting of beneficiaries through updated and accurate data collection methods. Continuous validation and updating of Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) data can help in reducing inclusion and exclusion errors.
Promoting Nutritional Security and Health Outcomes:
Expand the scope of subsidized items beyond basic grains to include more nutritious food options like pulses, edible oils, and fruits.
Mains PYQ:
What are the major challenges of Public Distribution System (PDS) in India? How can it be made effective and transparent?

Challenges related to asteroid Apophis
Why in the news?
Last week, ISRO Chairman S Somanath expressed the possibility of engaging with the asteroid Apophis during its close approach to Earth at a distance of 32,000 km in 2029. However, the specific manner of ISRO’s involvement has not yet been determined.
Space objects:
The asteroid Apophis may pose a threat:
Initial Concerns:
Discovered in 2004, Apophis initially posed a 2.7% chance of colliding with Earth, raising alarms due to its size (about 450 m wide).
Revised Risk:
Subsequent observations ruled out immediate collision risks in 2029, 2036, and 2068, but it will pass close to Earth in 2029 at 32,000 km.
Potential Impact:
Its size could cause significant damage if it were to collide with Earth, though recent observations suggest no imminent danger.
Other possible incoming threats from space:
Daily Encounters:
Thousands of asteroids enter Earth’s atmosphere daily, most burning up due to friction, causing phenomena like fireballs.
Russian Example:
In 2013, a 20-meter asteroid exploded above Russia, releasing significant energy and causing damage and injuries.
Detection Challenges:
Some asteroids are detected only upon entering the atmosphere, especially those coming from the direction of the Sun, which can obscure detection.
ISRO’s plan: From sci-fi to reality:
Planetary Defense Initiative:
ISRO aims to develop capabilities in planetary defense, potentially participating in missions to study and potentially deflect asteroids.
Collaboration:
Considering sending its own spacecraft or collaborating with other space agencies, like NASA, which has already redirected a spacecraft to study Apophis in 2029.
Evolution of ISRO:
Reflects ISRO’s evolution as a space agency, transitioning from aspirations to reality in tackling global space objectives, demonstrating growing confidence and capabilities.
Way forward:
Form Partnerships:
ISRO should actively seek partnerships with leading space agencies like NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and others involved in asteroid detection and planetary defense.
Joint Missions:
Collaborate on joint missions to study and potentially mitigate asteroid threats. This could include sharing resources, technology, and expertise to maximize effectiveness and minimize costs.
