Divide Between High-Skilled and Low-Skilled Jobs in India
Context:
A country with a population of 1.4 billion cannot rely entirely on the services sector to contribute to job creation, since this will increase the gap between high-skilled and low-skilled jobs.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is Happening in the Job Sector in India?
Why are These Trends in the Job Sector Concerning?
Way Ahead to Boost Jobs in India (Particularly in the Labour-Intensive Sectors)
Decline in labour-intensive jobs:
The Indian economic growth has increasingly been driven by the services sector
, particularly in IT, banking and finance, over the past two decades.
This has coincided with a noticeable decline in traditional industries such as apparel and footwear, which provide livelihoods for millions of low-skilled workers.
The stagnation in manufacturing
, which continues to remain at around 14% of GDP (well below the target of 25%), has exacerbated the
divide between high-skilled and low-skilled jobs.
Decline in export-related jobs:
According to a World Bank report, the export-related jobs in India have been
declining
over the past decade.
This is due to the
dominance of the service sector and high-skill manufacturing
in India’s export basket.
Since these sectors are
less suited to absorbing large portions of the Indian workforce
(India’s services exports constitute 4.3%, while goods exports 1.8% of the world’s), job creation due to trade has diminished.
High tariffs on input materials:
Since 2017, India appears to have reversed the tariff reductions initiated in the early 1990s.
As per the WTO Tariff Profile for 2022,
India’s average Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff increased to 18.1%, from 17.6% in 2019 and 13.4% in 2016
High import tariffs on key intermediate inputs have
raised production costs, making Indian producers less competitive in international markets
Declining participation in Global Value Chains (GVCs):
The Indian exporters with GVC linkages demonstrate stronger export performance and greater diversification in products and markets compared to those without such connections.
However, India’s participation in GVCs has been declining due to issues such as
difficulties in procuring raw materials and high transport costs.
High national unemployment rate:
According to the Economic Survey 2023-24, India needs to
create nearly 7.85 million jobs annually in the non-farm sector
to accommodate the growing workforce.
However, the national unemployment rate surged from
7 to 9% in June 2024
(as per the CMIE data).
India has been unable to capitalise on the opportunity presented by China:
Between 2015 and 2022, China’s participation in low-skill manufacturing of apparel, leather, textiles and footwear has decreased.
Countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Germany and the Netherlands (
not India
) have become the primary beneficiaries of China’s shrinking market share.
Way Ahead to Boost Jobs in India (Particularly in the Labour-Intensive Sectors):
Steps taken boost scale in the Indian textile sector:
PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks:
In 2023, the Centre had approved the setting up of
PM MITRA parks to develop world-class infrastructure with an outlay of Rs 4,445 crore for a period up to 2027-28.
National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP):
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs recently approved setting up of 12 industrial smart cities under the NICDP with an estimated investment of Rs 28,602 crore.
Reducing tariffs and simplifying procedures:
In the FY25 Union Budget, the government announced tariff reductions on various items, including medical equipment, critical minerals, solar energy products, leather and textiles, etc.
Rise in Global Capability Centres (GCCs):
Even as manufacturing in traditionally high-labour-intensive sectors has slowed,
India has emerged as a key market for MNCs to establish data analytics and software development centres.
Known as GCCs, these centres have proliferated in India, leveraging the large pool of qualified IT engineers in the country.
With close to 1,600 GCCs from MNCs across various sectors, India has become to the world what China is for tech hardware.

**********Centre Doubles Funding for Road Connectivity in LWE Areas
Why in the News?
The Centre has doubled the allocation of funds under the
Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas
(RCPLWEA) for financial year 2024-25.
Earlier, Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced that Left Wing Extremism will be “completely eradicated” in the country before March 2026.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About RCPLWEA (Objective, Funding, etc.)
About Naxalism (Meaning, Ambitions, Steps Taken by Govt.)
News Summary
About Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas:
The Union Government's Road Connectivity Project for
(LWE) Affected Areas aims
to improve infrastructure in regions impacted by insurgency and extremism
Launched as part of a broader strategy to foster development and peace, the project focuses on constructing and upgrading roads in the most affected areas.
As a separate vertical under the
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
(PMGSY), it is aimed at
providing all-weather road connectivity with culverts and cross-drainage structures in 44 worst-affected LWE districts and adjoining districts in 9 states
Under the scheme, the
Centre and states share the expenditure in 60:40 ratio
— same as under PMGSY.
Recently, the
Ministry of Rural Development
, the nodal ministry for the scheme, said the revised “indicative allocation” of funds — the central share — has been kept at
₹
1,000 crore for financial year 2024-25
This is double the amount allocated earlier.
About Naxalism:
The birth of Naxalism is pinpointed to the
Naxalbari
uprising in 1967.
Naxalbari, a village in West Bengal that gave its name to the movement, was the site of a peasant revolt, instigated by communist leaders such as
Charu Majumdar
Kanu Sanyal
, and
Jangal Santhal
against land owners of the State.
Naxalism is an
extremist ideology
which doesn’t believe in the concept of democracy and democratic process.
It is a form of
armed insurgency against the State
motivated by Leftist/Maoist ideologies and thus is also known as Left Wing extremism (LWE) or Maoism.
Ideologies of Naxals:
Chinese Communist ideologue and leader
Mao Zedong
provided ideological leadership for the Naxalbari movement, advocating that Indian peasants and tribals overthrow the government and upper classes by force.
The objective of their fight was
redistribution of land to working peasants, which was controlled by landlords for generations
Oppressed population, including tribes and rural Dalits, wanted their share of land which was denied to them for generations.
A large number of urban elites were also attracted to the ideology.
To achieve the same, the Naxals, or the Maoists as they are also known, engaged in a violent uprising against security forces.
The early 1970s saw the spread of Naxalism to almost every state in India, barring Western India.
Steps Taken by the Successive Governments to Counter Naxalism:
The Government has used various sustainable strategies towards the Maoist insurgency.
The principal strategy used by the government is the ‘
Law and Order Approach
’.
Intelligence and Networking
The government has set up Multi-Agency Centre (MAC) at the Central level and State Multi-Agency Centre (SMAC) at the state level.
These centres have proved to be highly effective in Maoist hotbeds.
Deployment of Central Paramilitary Forces
The creation of
Central Armed Police Forces
(CAPF) to carry out counterinsurgency strategies has been a significant factor to improve the condition.
SAMADHAN
In 2017, the Union Government launched SAMADHAN.
The acronym stands for the following:
S – Smart Leadership, A – Aggressive Strategy, M – Motivation and Training, A – Actionable Intelligence, D -Dashboard Based KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and KRAs (Key Result Areas), H- Harnessing Technology, A – Action plan for each theatre and N- No access to Financing.
This policy aims to hit at critical junctures in the Maoist links.
Ban on the CPI(Maoist) and the UAPA Act, 2009
The Union Government in 2009 put a countrywide ban on the CPI(Maoist).
Apart from this, the government enacted the
Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 2009
to put a check on the activities of the Naxalites and providing police and paramilitary forces autonomy and increased powers.
News Summary:
The government has doubled the funding for the RCPLWEA for the financial year 2024-25, following Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s announcement that LWE will be eradicated by March 2026.
The revised allocation of ₹1,000 crore from the central government, up from ₹500 crore, will require an additional ₹500 crore from the states, making the total funds for the project around ₹1,500 crore for the year.
The scheme is expected to boost socio-economic development and support security needs in these regions.
Since its inception,
1,347 road projects covering over 12,227 km have been sanctioned, with nearly 9,259 km of roads completed

**********Typhoon Yagi - Asia’s most powerful storm
Why in news?
Typhoon Yagi, the strongest tropical cyclone in Asia this year and second only to Hurricane Beryl globally, has caused widespread devastation across Southeast Asia.
Countries like the Philippines, China, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand have been severely affected, but Vietnam has borne the brunt of the storm, with around 233 deaths. Torrential rains, floods, and landslides have added to the challenges faced by millions in the affected areas.
What’s in today’s article?
Tropical Cyclones
Reasons behind Typhoon Yagi becoming the strongest storm in Asia
Operation Sadbhav by India
About
Cyclones that develop in the regions between the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer are called tropical cyclones.
The World Meteorological Organisation uses the term 'Tropical Cyclone’ to cover weather systems in which winds exceed ‘Gale Force’ (minimum of 34 knots or 63 kph).
Tropical cyclones are the progeny of ocean and atmosphere, powered by the heat from the sea; and driven by easterly trades and temperate westerlies, high planetary winds and their own fierce energy.
Formation of cyclones
Tropical Cyclone is a
weather phenomenon
, which is formed
only over warm ocean waters near the equator
Characteristics of a Tropical Cyclone:
centre of a cyclone is very calm and clear with very low air pressure
. The average speed is
120 kmph
They have closed
isobars
which leads to greater velocity.
Isobars are imaginary lines on a weather map that connect
locations with equal atmospheric pressure
They develop over oceans and sea only.
move from east to west
under the influence of trade winds.
They are seasonal in nature.
Classification of cyclones
Cyclones are classified
on the basis of wind speed
by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD):
Depression:
Wind speeds of between 31–49 km/h
Deep Depression:
Between 50-61 km/h
Cyclonic Storm:
Between 62–88 km/h
Severe Cyclonic Storm:
Between 89-117 Km/h
Very Severe Cyclonic Storm:
Between 118-166 Km/h
Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm
: Between 167-221 Km/h
Super Cyclonic Storm
: Above 222 Km/h
Category of a tropical cyclone
The category of a tropical cyclone is determined by its sustained wind speed, as measured by the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale
It is classified into five categories — Category 1 to Category 5.
While Category 1 tropical cyclones bring winds of 119 to 153 kmph, Category 5 tropical cyclones, which are the strongest, have winds of 252 kmph or higher.
Storms that reach Category 3 and higher are considered major tropical cyclones due to their potential to inflict significant damage.
Tropical cyclones are known by different names in various regions
Hurricanes
– In the in the West Indian islands in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.
Tornados
- In the Guinea lands of West Africa and southern USA
Typhoons
– In the Northwest Pacific Ocean, particularly affecting East and Southeast Asia (e.g., Japan, Philippines, China, Taiwan).
– In the Southwest Indian Ocean (off the coast of Africa, Madagascar), the Southeast Indian Ocean, and the Southwest Pacific Ocean.
Willy-Willies
– An informal term used for tropical cyclones in Australia.
Warm waters of South China Sea
Typhoon Yagi started as a tropical storm in the western Philippine Sea. It made landfall in the Philippines and started to weaken.
However, due to
unusually warm waters in the South China Sea
, the storm intensified again.
Later, it became a Category 5 typhoon with peak maximum sustained winds of 260 kmph.
Typhoon Yagi is one of four Category 5 storms recorded in the South China Sea, after Pamela in 1954, Rammasun in 2014, and Rai in 2021.
The storm was subsequently downgraded to a tropical depression but still brought heavy rains last week in countries such as Myanmar, where it triggered severe floods around the remote capital, Naypyidaw.
Role of climate change
Scientists are still debating how climate change affects tropical cyclones, as many factors influence storm formation and development.
However, there is agreement that rising global temperatures are making tropical cyclones more intense.
A recent study suggests that in Southeast Asia, cyclones are now forming closer to coastlines, intensifying faster, and lingering longer over land.
This is likely due to warmer sea surface temperatures, which have increased by nearly 0.9°C since 1850.
Hotter oceans fuel storms with more water vapor and heat, leading to stronger winds, heavier rainfall, and increased flooding when storms make landfall.
Operation Sadbhav by India
India launched Operation Sadbhav to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) to Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam that have been hit by severe flooding caused by Typhoon Yagi.
India has committed $1mn worth of flood relief assistance to Vietnam and $1,00,000 worth of assistance to Laos.
India has been among the first responders in providing HADR to the region.
This Operation is part of India’s broader effort to contribute to HADR within the ASEAN region, in line with its longstanding Act East Policy.

**********One nation, one election to be implemented in this term
Why in news?
As per the government official, the concept of simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, referred to as “One Nation, One Election” will be implemented within the current term of the present government.
What’s in today’s article?
Simultaneous elections in India
High-level Committee (HLC) on One Nation, One Election
Key recommendations of the HLC
About
The concept of "
" envisions a system in which all state and Lok Sabha elections must be held simultaneously.
This will entail restructuring the Indian election cycle so that elections to the states and the centre coincide.
This would imply that
voters will vote for members of the LS and state assemblies on the same day and at the same time
(or in a phased manner as the case may be).
Various Committees on Simultaneous election
The idea of returning to simultaneous elections was raised in the Election Commission's annual report in 1983.
It was also mentioned in the Law Commission's Report in 1999.
Following the reintroduction of the idea by PM Modi in 2016, the NITI Aayog prepared a working paper on the subject in 2017.
The Law Commission stated in its 2018 working paper that at least "five Constitutional recommendations" would be required to make simultaneous elections a reality in India again.
In June 2019, PM Modi said that a committee would be formed to examine the issue and a meeting with leaders of political parties would be called.
In July 2022, the issue of holding simultaneous Parliamentary and Assembly elections was referred to the 22
Law Commission.
It recommended various steps in order to conduct simultaneous elections in India.
It also suggested the addition of a new chapter (Part XVA) on simultaneous polls in the Constitution.
The HLC, popularly known as the Kovind panel after its chairman, former President Ram Nath Kovind, was constituted in September 2023.
It was constituted to study the issues involving One Nation, One Election. It submitted its report in March 2024.
Simultaneous election by 2029
The panel recommended
amending the Constitution
so that elections for the Lok Sabha, all state assemblies and local bodies can be held by 2029.
Amending the Constitution
The Constitution should be amended to enable simultaneous elections in two steps.
In all,
18 amendments to the Constitution and other statutes have been suggested
In the first step
, simultaneous elections will be held to Lok Sabha and State Assemblies.
In the second step
, elections to municipalities and the panchayats will be synchronised with elections to Lok Sabha and state Assemblies.
This will be done in such a way that local body elections are held within 100 days of the elections to Lok Sabha and state Assemblies.
This will require ratification by not less than one-half of the states
Achieving synchronization for first step
To achieve synchronisation at the first step, the government should take a one-time step where they pick a specific date after a Lok Sabha election.
After this date, the terms of all state assemblies that have elections will end along with Parliament's term.
To effect these changes, the panel has recommended amendments to
Article 83
(duration of Houses of Parliament) and
Article 172
(duration of State legislatures) of the Constitution.
For this,
no ratification by the states will be required for the constitutional amendment
Insertion of Article 324A
The committee recommended an
, which states that Parliament may make a law to ensure that elections to municipalities and panchayats be held together with General Elections.
This is to enable municipal and panchayat elections to be held simultaneously with the others.
Single electoral roll and election ID
To make single electoral roll and electoral photo identity cards for use in elections to all the three tiers of government, the Constitution should be amended.
For this, the committee recommended that Article 325 of the Constitution be amended.
Then only, Election Commission of India can prepare a single electoral roll and election ID in consultation with the State Election Commissions.
These
amendments will require ratification by not less than one-half of the states
In case of hung house
In the event of a hung House, a no-confidence motion, or any such event,
fresh elections should be held to constitute the new Lok Sabha or state Assembly for the unexpired term of the House
Meeting logistics requirement
The committee suggests that the Election Commission of India should plan ahead with State Election Commissions for things like manpower, polling staff, security forces, and voting machines to ensure fair elections across all levels of government at the same time.
Rejected the Germany model of bringing no-confidence motion against a government
The committee rejected the concept of constructive vote of no-confidence, which is the model in Germany.
In this model, to bring a no-confidence motion against a government, a positive vote of confidence in an alternate leader or government is required.
The committee said that the prevailing Parliamentary practice in this regard is appropriate and does not require any change.
Making a motion of no confidence by the Members of the Parliament is not only their right, but also their responsibility.
The Committee would not like to dilute this feature of the Indian Parliamentary system.

Polity & Governance
**********Realizing the rural-urban continuum
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Government schemes and Initiatives; AMRUT;
Mains level:
Challenges in Rural-Urban Area;
Why in the News?
India is currently experiencing an urban transformation due to
significant demographic shifts and increasing infrastructure needs.
To effectively address these challenges, it must adopt a
holistic urban-rural continuum approach.
Issue of Over-Centralisation of Finances:
Over Financial Centralisation
: Recent times have seen an over-centralization of finances, which has negatively impacted financial decentralization and autonomy for local bodies.
The
13th Finance Commission
highlighted that local bodies are being “asphyxiated” due to this centralization.
Tied vs. Untied Grants
: Local bodies face financial constraints because
grants
are often tied to
centrally sponsored schemes.
The rise in
property tax
needs to match the rise in
State Goods and Services Tax
to avoid losing tied grants, which have increased relative to untied grants over the years.
Programmatic Limitations
: Flagship programmes like the
Swachh Bharat Mission and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)
fail to address the urban-rural continuum effectively.
Urban-Rural Continuum Challenge
: Infrastructure funding for areas like sewage treatment plants often excludes contiguous urban villages and census towns, which are integral parts of the broader urban ecosystem.
Initiatives taken by the Government:
: It aims to improve urban infrastructure for liquid waste management, but its scope initially covered only statutory towns, now extended to all statutory towns.
Swachh Bharat Mission 1.0:
It focuses on making
urban India garbage-free and managing solid and liquid waste.
Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0
: The mission aims to extend beyond open defecation-free status to
sustainable waste management in urban areas
and solid and liquid waste management in rural areas.
Governance models needs to be revisited:
73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments
: District Planning Committees, including Zila Panchayats and urban local bodies,
need to be empowered
Strengthening District Planning Committees
: Currently, District Planning Committees are
often subordinate to the district bureaucracy.
Strengthening these committees can better integrate urban and rural planning and improve governance.
Integrated Planning
: The current approach to separate
urban and rural local bodies
needs updating. Given India’s rapid urbanisation, there is a need for integrated and joint planning to address the blurring lines between urban and rural areas effectively.
Collaborative Infrastructure Planning
: Solid waste management and other infrastructure projects could benefit from collaborative
planning at the district or regional levels,
rather than being implemented in a compartmentalised manner.
Way forward:
Enhance Financial Decentralisation and Flexibility
: Reform financial mechanisms to reduce centralisation, provide greater autonomy to local bodies, and ensure grants are more flexible, allowing for better alignment of local needs with urban-rural continuum challenges.
Strengthen Integrated Planning Frameworks
: Revise governance models to empower
for more cohesive urban-rural planning, and promote collaborative infrastructure development across district and regional levels to address the interconnectedness of urban and rural areas.
Mains PYQ:
What are ‘Smart Cities’? examine their relevance for urban development in India. Will it increase rural-urban differences? Give arguments for ‘Smart Villages’ in the light of PURA and RURBAN Mission.

initiatives like drone technology training.
Significance and Scope of DMF in India:
Community Welfare
: DMFs provide direct financial resources for the
welfare of communities affected by mining activities,
transforming mineral wealth into tangible social benefits.
Inclusive Development
: DMFs empower local communities, with focus on
social inclusivity
by involving elected representatives and non-elected gram sabha members in governance structures.
Cooperative Federalism
: DMFs are a model of cooperative federalism, converging
national, state, and local governance
to address mining impacts and foster regional development.
Innovation and Planning
: Various DMFs innovate to maximise project impact, adopting
three-year plans for goal-oriented development
, establishing dedicated engineering departments, and employing Public Works Department personnel for efficient project execution.
Sustainability
: DMFs aim to align with the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
focusing on forest dwellers’ livelihoods, sports infrastructure, and health. They contribute to long-term environmental and socio-economic sustainability.
Way Forward:
Standardisation and Best Practices
: Establish uniform guidelines to
standardise successful practices across DMFs
while retaining local knowledge, ensuring efficient implementation of long-term, goal-oriented projects.
Enhanced Integration with National Schemes
: Strengthen the integration of DMF activities with
ongoing central and state schemes,
particularly in aspirational districts, to amplify the socio-economic and environmental benefits in mining-affected regions.
**********Post-glacial ecosystems could help slow down climate change – Study
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Glacier Retreat;
Mains level:
Climate Change; Impact of Glacier Retreat;
Why in the News?
The retreat of glaciers is one of the most visible indicators of climate change
but it also creates new ecosystems that could play a role in mitigating its effects, according to a global study titled
‘The Development of Terrestrial Ecosystems Emerging After Glacier Retreat’
published in “
Nature”.
How are Glaciers Formed?
Glaciers form when
snowfall accumulate
s over time in a particular area where temperatures are consistently cold enough for snow to remain year-round.
Over the years, the
weight of accumulating snow compresses the lower layers
, turning them into
firn (a dense snowpack).
Further compression transforms firn into ice.
Once thick enough, glaciers begin to move under the force of gravity, flowing slowly like rivers of ice. The glacier’s movement is driven by the
internal deformation of the ice and sliding at its base,
leading to the
formation of crevasses and other glacial features.
What is Glacier Retreat?
Glacier retreat refers to the process where
glaciers lose mass due to melting and insufficient snowfall to replenish their ice.
This phenomenon is accelerated by
climate change, leading to rising sea levels and altered water supplies.
As global temperatures rise, glaciers shrink more rapidly, which
impacts ecosystems and human communities
that rely on glacial meltwater for drinking, agriculture, and hydropower.
Key Highlights of the Recent Study
The recent study titled “The Development of Terrestrial Ecosystems Emerging After Glacier Retreat,” published in Nature, presents several significant findings:
Ecosystem Development:
The study indicates that while glacier retreat is a clear sign of climate change, it also leads to the emergence of new ecosystems that can mitigate
climate change effects
because of it can enhance
carbon capture and storage
through
biogeochemical processes.
Microbial Colonization:
Following glacier retreat,
microorganisms
such as
bacteria and algae
are the first to colonize the barren landscapes, which helps in
soil formation
Within a decade, hardy plants
like lichens and grasses
establish themselves, further enriching the soil and enabling more complex life forms to thrive.
Management Importance:
The study emphasizes that with appropriate strategies to manage it because, these areas can quickly develop, providing habitats for species threatened by climate change and contributing to biodiversity conservation
Water Regulation:
In regions like the Himalayas, post-glacial ecosystems are vital for
regulating water availability,
impacting rivers that support millions of people.
Potential for Discoveries:
The biodiversity in these areas may
lead to new agricultural and medicinal discoveries,
highlighting the ecological benefits of protecting and studying these ecosystems
Way forward:
Ecosystem Management
: Implement strategies for managing emerging post-glacial ecosystems to enhance their carbon capture potential and biodiversity conservation, supporting climate change mitigation efforts.
Research and Conservation
: Prioritize research on these ecosystems, particularly in regions like the Himalayas, to safeguard water resources and explore potential agricultural and medicinal discoveries, benefiting both the environment and local economies.
Mains PYQ:
Bring out the relationship between the shrinking Himalayan glaciers and the symptoms of climate change in the Indian sub-continent.

Jute, often referred to as the
‘golden fibre’
, is considered safe for packaging due to its natural, renewable, biodegradable, and eco-friendly properties.
The Jute Industry in India is over
150 years old
, with approximately
93 jute mills
currently in operation, as per the
Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA)

Jute Cultivation in India
Jute cultivation is mainly concentrated in
3 Indian states
: West Bengal, Assam, and Bihar which together produce
99% of the country’s jute
Conditions Required:
Temperature:
25-35°C
Rainfall:
150-250 cm

**********India raises Import Tax on Edible Oils
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Edible Oil Trade in India
Why in the News?
India has increased the
basic import tax
crude
and refined edible oils
by
20%
to protect domestic farmers suffering from low oilseed prices.
The move could push up edible oil prices,
reduce demand, and potentially lower imports of palm oil, soyoil, and sunflower oil.
Edible Oil Scenario in India
India imports
more than
70% of its vegetable oil
demand, mainly sourcing:
Palm oil
Indonesia
Malaysia, and Thailand
Soyoil and sunflower oil
Argentina, Brazil, Russia
Ukraine
constitutes over
50% of India’s edible oil imports
NITI Aayog Report on Edible Oil Self-sufficiency
Key Highlights
NITI Aayog, along with the Ministry of Agriculture and other stakeholders, released a report titled “Pathways and Strategies for Accelerating Growth in Edible Oils Towards the Goal of Atmanirbharta.”
Details
Consumption Details
India consumes
19.7 kg/year
per capita edible oil, with
16.5 million tonnes
of imports in 2022-23; only
40-45%
of demand met through domestic production.
Projections
Domestic production could reach
16 MT by 2030
26.7 MT by 2047
under Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario
Strategic Interventions
Crop Retention and Diversification
Horizontal Expansion (increase cultivation area)
Vertical Expansion (improve yield through technology)
Self-sufficiency Targets
Edible oil production of
36.2 MT by 2030
70.2 MT by 2047
