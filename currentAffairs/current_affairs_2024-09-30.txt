What India Can Do to Reduce Food Wastage
Context
The
issue of food loss and waste (FLW) is a critical global challenge
that has profound implications for food security, environmental sustainability, and economic efficiency.
Recognising the urgency of the matter,
the United Nations designated September 29 as the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste (FLW).
It is
important to have an assessment on the scale of food loss and waste, its environmental impact, and India’s specific challenges
and efforts to mitigate these losses.
Global Impact of Food Loss and Waste
According to a 2023 Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report
, food lost between harvest and retail
accounts for 13.2% of global food production, while UNEP estimates that 17% of food is wasted
at the retail and consumption stages.
Combined,
this amounts to nearly 30% of global food production being lost or wasted each year
If just half of this food could be saved, it would be sufficient to feed all the world’s hungry people,
thus contributing to the global fight against hunger.
Furthermore,
reducing FLW would lead to a significant decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG)
It is estimated that
FLW contributes to 8-10% of global GHG emissions
accounts for 38% of total energy usage in food production.
An Assessment on Causes of Food Loss in India
Lack of Mechanisation
All-India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS)
in 2019 revealed that only
4
4% of cultivator households in India owned tractors, and only 5.3% owned essential farm equipment
such as power tillers, combine harvesters, or threshers.
Small and marginal farmers,
who make up over 86% of India’s agricultural households, often
cannot afford these machines.
As a result,
manual methods are still widely used, which increases the risk of food loss
during harvesting and processing.
For instance,
combine harvesters, when used in paddy cultivation, significantly reduce grain losses
compared to traditional methods, but their use is limited to
regions like Punjab, where 97% of paddy-producing households use mechanized equipment.
In contrast,
only 10% of paddy farmers in Bihar have access to such equipment.
Inadequate Cold Chain Infrastructure
cold chain infrastructure is underdeveloped
, particularly for perishable goods like fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.
Due to the lack of proper refrigeration and temperature-controlled transport,
a large proportion of horticultural crops are lost
before they even reach the market.
absence of efficient cold chains results in spoilage and wastage
, reducing both the availability of fresh produce and the potential income for farmers.
According to a survey,
horticultural crops are especially vulnerable
, with nearly 50 MMT lost annually due to this deficiency.
Traditional Drying and Storage Methods
While
sun drying is a low-cost option, it exposes food to contamination from dust, pests, and uneven moisture levels
, leading to quality degradation and food loss.
inadequate storage facilities exacerbate post-harvest losses, with 10% of total food grain production is lost
due to poor and inadequate storage infrastructure.
Without access to modern drying technologies such as solar dryers or proper storage infrastructure
like warehouses and silos,
farmers face significant challenges
in preserving their produce, especially during the monsoon season.
Transportation and Supply Chain Inefficiencies
India’s vast geography, coupled with poor road infrastructure in rural areas, means that
transporting crops from farms to markets can take considerable time.
During this period,
perishable goods are particularly prone to spoilage
due to exposure to heat, moisture, and handling damage.
Even non-perishable items such as grains can suffer from poor handling and packaging
during transit, leading to further losses.
Impact of Food Loss in India
Economic Consequences
The monetary value of food loss in India is alarming,
with Rs 1.53 trillion worth of food wasted annually.
This
translates into lost income for farmers, especially small and marginal farmers
who cannot absorb these losses.
Food loss
also affects the country’s GDP, as agriculture accounts for a significant portion
of India’s economy.
Additionally,
the lost produce could have been sold domestically or exported,
reducing potential revenue streams for both the government and farmers.
Environmental Impact
Agriculture is a resource-intensive sector
, requiring large amounts of water, energy, and land, therefore,
when food is lost or wasted, all the resources that went into producing it are wasted as well.
In India, this is particularly concerning
given the country’s ongoing struggles with water scarcity and land degradation.
food that is discarded often ends up in landfills
, where it decomposes and produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
Reducing food loss would not only conserve resources but also lower the country’s greenhouse gas emissions
, contributing to the fight against climate change.
Social and Food Security Implications
According to the Global Hunger Index,
India ranks poorly in terms of hunger and malnutrition,
with millions of people unable to access sufficient nutritious food.
fact that such a large quantity of food is lost each year while millions go hungry is a stark indicator of systemic inefficiencies.
If even a portion of the food lost post-harvest could be saved, it would significantly improve food security in the country
and reduce the incidence of malnutrition, particularly in rural areas.
Solutions to Address the Food Loss Problem in India
Mechanization and Technological Interventions
Expanding the use of mechanised farming equipment,
particularly among small and marginal farmers, is essential for reducing post-harvest losses.
Initiatives such as
Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) can help farmers access machinery
through group leasing or shared services.
investing in green technologies like solar dryers and modern storage facilities can further reduce losses
, particularly for perishable goods.
Improving Cold Chain Infrastructure
Building a robust cold chain infrastructure is crucial
for reducing the spoilage of perishable products.
Government initiatives to
encourage private investment in cold chains, as well as public-private partnerships, can help bridge the infrastructure gap.
Expanding cold storage facilities and improving refrigerated transportation would enable farmers to extend the shelf life of their produce
and reach wider markets, thereby reducing food loss.
Policy Reforms
Policy interventions are necessary
to ensure that small and marginal farmers can benefit from technological advancements and infrastructure improvements.
revisiting the Jute Packaging Material Act (JPMA) to allow for the use of airtight bags in place of jute bags could significantly reduce storage
and transit losses.
Similarly,
government programs that offer subsidies
for modern storage facilities, cold chains, and mechanised equipment
would support farmers in reducing food loss.
Education and Awareness Campaigns
Educating farmers
about best practices in harvesting, drying, and storage
is crucial for minimising losses.
Training programs on the use of modern technologies,
such as combine harvesters and solar dryers,
can empower farmers to adopt more efficient methods.
raising awareness among consumers about food waste at the household level
especially in urban areas
where waste from weddings and events is high, could help reduce food wastage.
Conclusion
India’s food loss and waste
problem presents
both a challenge and an opportunity.
Reducing food loss is not merely an economic necessity but a moral obligation
, especially in a country where millions still suffer from hunger and malnutrition.
By prioritising solutions, India can contribute to global efforts to tackle food loss and waste
while fostering a more sustainable and resilient agricultural system.

Editorial Analysis
**********Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Urban 2.0
Why in News?
Since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Urban 2.0, large cities have not cleared any land in half of their legacy landfill sites, with just 38% of the total dumped waste has been remedied so far.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)?
Analysing the SBM Urban 2.0
Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM):
About:
The Government of India had launched
the SBM on 2nd October 2014
to accelerate the efforts to achieve universal sanitation coverage and to put focus on sanitation.
The mission has two components - rural (
SBM-Gramin,
overseen by the Ministry of Jal Shakti) and urban (
SBM-Urban
, overseen by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs [MoHUA]).
Under these components,
all villages, Gram Panchayats, Districts, States and UTs
in India had to declare themselves "open-defecation free" (ODF) by 2 October 2019 - the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Achievements:
As one of the largest cleanliness drives in the world, SBM has brought in
a remarkable transformation and traceable benefits
to the society as a whole.
Many States have achieved the status of 100% ODF and Individual Household Latrines (IHHL) coverage, thereby
leading to a sea change in the dignity of people, especially women
This mission acts as a driver for
eliminating the gender disparity
through the construction of gender-specific latrines in public areas such as schools, roads and parks.
This public movement will have an indirect positive impact on society by
increasing the enrolment ratio of girls in schools and improving health standards.
Analysing the SBM Urban 2.0:
Launched in
2021
, the SBM Urban 2.0 has the target of
clearing around 2,400 legacy landfill sites in the country by 2025-2026
Legacy waste dumpsites
are places that contain solid waste that has been collected and stored for years in an unscientific and uncontrolled manner.
Funding:
To get funding from SBM Urban 2.0,
cities are supposed to submit action plans to the MoHUA for bioremediation
of their legacy landfills and then reuse of the land cleared.
Process:
Converting the waste into different categories, leading to the -
Creation of
refuse derived fuel (RDF)
for waste-to-energy plants,
Recycling
of construction and demolition waste and
bio-soil
that can be used for road construction.
Performance:
Out of the 69 landfill sites (accounting for 57% of the total waste dumped in landfills in the country) in cities with a population over 1 million,
land is yet to be cleared in 35 sites.
Out of a total area of 3,354 acres with 1,258 lakh metric tonnes of waste in these 69 sites, 1,171 acres with 475 lakh MT of waste have been cleared so far.
Some success stories:
Ahmedabad
has been able to clear up 4.3 acres of land that used to have 2.30 lakh tonnes of waste. The site has been redeveloped as an ecological park.
Nagpur’s
legacy landfill spread over 35 acres, with 10 lakh metric tonnes of waste, has also been 100% cleared under the mission.
The bioremediation
of the waste led to generation of refuse derived fuel and manure, which is being sold.
The site will be used for an integrated waste management project.
Pune’s
legacy landfill at Vanaz has been cleared for use as a depot for the Metro in the city.
Lucknow’s
landfill at Ghaila was spread over 72 acres, with 8 lakh tonnes of waste. The site has been cleared and is being used to develop a park, Rashtriya Prerna Sthal.
Challenges ahead:
Despite significant progress under the SBM, a large portion of legacy waste and landfills continues to
present environmental, health and space constraints
for cities.
The cities are facing the challenge of clearing the remaining 65% of land and remediating 62% of garbage left at the legacy landfill sites, with less than 2 years to go before the scheme is completed.
Way ahead:
Proper planning
before starting the bioremediation process.
Stopping dumping fresh waste
on the sites undergoing remediation.
Providing alternative locations to process fresh waste.
Stopping the use of the fine soil-like material generated from the sites as compost, because of the possibility of contamination due to the presence of heavy metals.

**********Can a variety of rice address farm fires in Punjab & Haryana?
Context:
In order to tackle the issue of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, govt. is looking for different varieties of rice.
Pusa-2090 yields nearly as much as Pusa-44, the first choice of farmers. But it can be harvested by early to mid-October, eliminating the need for stubble burning before the sowing of wheat.
What’s in today’s article?
About
, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in 1993, takes 155-160 days to mature.
It has high yield of 35-36 quintals per acre, sometimes reaching 40 quintals.
Despite its longer growing period compared to the
PR-126
variety, which matures in 123-125 days and yields 30-32 quintals per acre, farmers prefer
This is because the additional 4-5 quintals per acre translates to extra earnings of
Rs 9,280-11,600
at the government-set minimum support price of Rs 2,320 per quintal for 'Grade A' paddy.
Environmental cost associated with Pusa-44
While
Pusa-44 paddy
offers high yields,
its long growing period causes issues for farmers in Punjab and Haryana
Harvesting in late October leaves
little time for wheat sowing
, leading many to burn the remaining straw and stubble for quick field preparation, contributing to severe air pollution in northern India during late October to mid-November.
Although
cultivation has decreased from 39% in 2012 to 14.8% of Punjab’s non-basmati paddy area in 2023, it remains popular in many districts of the region.
Despite a government ban and lack of new seeds, farmers continue using saved seeds to grow Pusa-44.
Pusa-2090 is a newly bred, shorter-duration paddy variety developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) as a potential replacement for Pusa-44.
A cross between
CB-501
(an early-maturing Japonica rice line),
120-125 days
, similar to PR-126, but with a higher yield of 34-35 quintals per acre, closer to Pusa-44’s yield.
Benefits
The variety maintains a high number of tillers (branches with grain-bearing ear-heads or panicles) and grains per panicle, comparable to Pusa-44 and higher than PR-126.
Pusa-2090 also features a strong culm, making it less prone to lodging (bending over or falling due to heavy winds and rains) in adverse weather conditions, and it is highly responsive to nitrogen application.
Moreover, its shorter duration results in significant water savings, requiring 5-6 fewer irrigations than Pusa-44, which typically needs 29-30.
A viable replacement of Pusa-44?
Pusa-2090 has a lower reduction in yield compared to Pusa-44, as it produces almost as much grain as Pusa-44.
At the same time, Pusa-2090 matures in a shorter time, similar to PR-126, which allows farmers to harvest earlier and potentially prepare for the next crop without delays.
Therefore, Pusa-2090 presents a promising, viable option for farmers seeking both high yields and efficient water use.
Farmers of this region are also considering Pusa-2090 as a potential replacement for Pusa-44, especially since the latter has been banned.
However, in addition to yields, milling quality is also important.
PR-126 is less favored by millers due to its low rice recovery rate of
63%
, below the government's standard of 67%.
If
matches the grain quality of Pusa-44, it could gain wider acceptance among millers as well.

Tax Reforms
The introduction of the GST on July 1, 2017, streamlined India's tax system by unifying 36 states and union territories into a common market.
Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
India’s UPI has become a global leader in digital payments, processing 46% of the world’s real-time transactions.
Between April and July 2024, UPI processed nearly ₹81 lakh crore, highlighting its robust infrastructure and growing consumer trust.
Ease of Doing Business
India made remarkable progress in improving its business environment, climbing from 142nd in 2014 to 63rd in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report (DBR) 2020, published in October 2019.
This jump reflects the government’s sustained efforts to simplify regulations, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, and create a more business-friendly environment, significantly boosting investor confidence.
Record FDI to Boost MII
MII has been significantly boosted by record FDI inflows, driven by simplified FDI rules and improved ease of doing business.
FDI inflows increased from $45.14 billion in 2014-15 to a record $84.83 billion in 2021-22.
Between 2014 and 2024, India attracted $667.41 billion in FDI, with total inflows reaching $70.95 billion in FY 2023-24.
Key Achievements
Manufacturing Growth
India has emerged as the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer.

The textile industry has created a staggering 14.5 crore jobs across the country.
India produces an impressive 400 million toys annually
, with 10 new toys being created every second.
Criticism
Experts highlights that the scheme has largely been ineffective in either increasing the share of manufacturing in GDP or attracting major investments in the country.
Even on the employment front, manufacturing jobs remain few and far between.
The share of value addition by manufacturing sector is 15.9 percent in 2023-24 compared to 16.7 percent of GDP (in constant price) in 2013-14.
Even in terms of FDI, net FDI inflows have come down from 1.5 percent of GDP in 2013-14 to 0.8 percent in 2023-24.
Challenges
Ease of doing business is still a far cry from what is claimed on paper.
High incidence of taxation and high handedness in dealing with tax litigation cases.
Scarcity of skilled workers in India and competition from Vietnam and Bangladesh for low-skilled manufacturing.
Conclusion
As "Make in India" enters its second decade, it stands as a testament to India's determination to reshape its manufacturing landscape and enhance its global standing.
With the support of strategic reforms, such as the PLI schemes, PM GatiShakti, and the National Logistics Policy, India has emerged as a competitive and self-reliant economy.
The success of indigenous projects like the Vande Bharat trains, the INS Vikrant, and the growing electronics sector signals a promising future for India’s industrial and manufacturing sectors

**********Small Modular N-Reactors
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction
About SMRs (Meaning, Working, Characteristics, Types, Benefits, Challenges, etc.)
News Summary (Govt. Measures to promote SMRs)
Introduction:
As the world grapples with the urgent need to decarbonize energy systems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, nuclear energy is resurfacing as a critical component of the solution.
While traditional nuclear power plants are large and costly to build, Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs) are emerging as a promising alternative.
These compact reactors offer the potential to provide safe, scalable, and sustainable energy to meet global demands.
What are Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)?
Small Modular Reactors are nuclear reactors designed to generate a small amount of electricity—
typically up to 300 MW per unit
Unlike traditional large nuclear reactors, which generate up to 1,000 MW or more, SMRs are smaller in size, allowing for modular deployment, enhanced safety features, and reduced construction times.
SMRs operate on the same fundamental principles as traditional nuclear reactors, using nuclear fission to generate heat.
This heat is then used to produce steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity.
Characteristics of SMRs:
Modularity
: SMRs can be factory-built in modules and transported to the installation site, which significantly reduces on-site construction time and costs.
Scalability
: The modular nature allows for flexible scaling, enabling utilities to add capacity as demand grows.
Safety Enhancements
: Many SMR designs incorporate passive safety systems, which rely on natural forces like gravity and convection, reducing the need for operator intervention in emergencies.
Lower Capital Costs
: Smaller reactors mean lower upfront investments, making SMRs an attractive option for countries and regions with limited financial resources for energy infrastructure.
Types of SMRs:
Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs)
: Most SMRs are based on PWR technology, where water is used as both a coolant and moderator.
Fast Neutron Reactors
: These reactors use fast neutrons and liquid metal coolants to achieve higher efficiency in fuel use.
Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs)
: Instead of solid fuel, MSRs use liquid fuel dissolved in molten salt, offering inherent safety benefits by reducing the risk of meltdown.
High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors (HTGRs)
: These reactors use helium as a coolant and can operate at higher temperatures, increasing efficiency.
Benefits of SMRs:
Safety:
SMRs are designed with advanced safety features that significantly reduce the risk of accidents.
Many designs feature
that automatically shut down the reactor without human intervention if certain safety parameters are exceeded.
Cost-Effectiveness:
Traditional nuclear plants are capital-intensive and often face construction delays. SMRs, on the other hand, are designed to be more affordable.
With their modular design, they can be manufactured in factories and assembled on-site, lowering construction costs and timelines.
Scalability & Flexibility:
One of the primary advantages of SMRs is their scalability.
Utility companies can install a single reactor to meet current energy demand and add more modules over time as demand grows.
This makes SMRs particularly suitable for smaller grids or regions with fluctuating energy needs.
Lower Environmental Impact:
While nuclear power is already considered low-carbon, SMRs offer further environmental benefits:
Reduced Waste Generation
: Some advanced SMR designs are capable of reusing spent nuclear fuel, reducing the volume of radioactive waste.
Small Physical Footprint
: SMRs occupy less land compared to traditional nuclear plants, making them easier to site in remote or space-constrained areas.
Challenges Facing SMR Deployment:
Regulatory Hurdles:
Nuclear energy, being a highly regulated industry, poses a challenge for SMRs. Existing regulatory frameworks are designed for large nuclear plants, and SMRs will require tailored regulations that account for their smaller size and enhanced safety features.
Public Perception:
The legacy of nuclear disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima continues to impact public perception. Gaining public trust and dispelling myths around the safety of SMRs will be critical for widespread acceptance.
High Initial Costs:
While SMRs are more affordable than large nuclear plants, the upfront costs are still higher compared to renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
This can make it difficult to secure investment without clear long-term policy support and financial incentives.
Waste Disposal:
Although SMRs produce less nuclear waste, the issue of waste disposal remains.
A comprehensive strategy for handling and storing nuclear waste will be essential for the sustainable operation of SMRs.
News Summary: Small nuclear reactors get traction
India's ambitions to enter the
manufacturing value chain are showing positive signs, with
private players expressing interest in deploying these reactors at their captive sites
SMRs, which range between
30 MWe to 300 MWe
per unit, are seen as key to keeping nuclear energy commercially competitive.
India is positioning itself as a leader in SMRs, both as part of its
clean energy transition
and as a foreign policy initiative.
Russia
, a major SMR player alongside
China
, is reportedly looking to expand nuclear cooperation with India in this field.
Technical discussions are underway to assess the feasibility of SMRs in India, with the
Atomic Energy Act, 1962
guiding policy decisions. The
Indian government is also considering private sector involvement in this sector
Globally, only two SMRs have reached operational status—
Akademik Lomonosov
in Russia and
HTR-PM
in China.
India aims to emerge as a credible alternative, leveraging its history of operating small reactors and cost-effective nuclear manufacturing capabilities.
Steps Taken by Government to Promote SMRs:
Integration of SMRs into National Energy Plans
: The Indian government has highlighted nuclear energy as a crucial part of its clean energy transition. SMRs, being a flexible and scalable alternative, have been integrated into discussions on future energy policies to diversify the nuclear energy portfolio.
Long-term Strategy for Net-Zero
: India’s ambitious target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070 includes nuclear energy as a key component, and the government is increasingly considering SMRs as a clean and safe option for decentralized energy production.
Budget Allocations for Nuclear R&D
: The Indian government has allocated funds in its budget to enhance nuclear research, focusing on advanced reactor technologies like SMRs. This funding supports R&D efforts and contributes to infrastructure development.
In the 2024-25 Indian Budget, the government announced plans to partner with the private sector to develop and set up "
Bharat Small Reactors
", essentially SMRs.

**********Was animal fat present in Tirupati laddus?
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Adulteration issues in India;
Why in the News?
The ghee samples used by ‘Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams’ for ritual offerings and ‘Laddu Prasadam’ were found to contain foreign fats, including fish oil, beef tallow, and lard, as per the
NDDB’s analysis report.
What did the ALF of the National Dairy Development Board find in the Tirupati laddus?
Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF)
of the National Dairy Development Board found that ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) for preparing laddus were adulterated with various fats.
Adulterants detected included:
Plant-based fats:
soybean, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, linseed, wheat germ, maize germ, cotton seed, coconut, and palm kernel fat.
Animal-based fats:
fish oil, beef tallow, and lard (pig fat).
Existing Laws:
Indian Penal Code (1860)
penalizes food adulteration under
Section 272,
but penalties are often minimal, leading to insufficient deterrence.
Food Safety and Standards Act, of 2006
aims to consolidate food safety regulations, but implementation remains weak due to inadequate resources and oversight.
Implementation Gaps:
Despite robust standards set by the
FSSAI,
the actual enforcement is lacking. For instance, many tests that could detect sophisticated forms of adulteration are only sometimes conducted due to a lack of testing facilities and trained personnel.
A study by the
Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)
highlighted that major brands of honey were found to be adulterated with
undetectable syrups,
raising concerns about the effectiveness of current testing protocols.
Why maintaining a good baseline data (specific to Indian conditions) is necessary?
Biological Variation in Indian Cows
: Baseline data specific to Indian cows is needed for accurate results. Indian cows may have different genetic and biochemical profiles compared to European cows, meaning the existing international standards for detecting adulteration (like the ‘s-values’)
may not accurately reflect
the composition of Indian cow ghee.
Adulterants Unique to Local Conditions
: The types of adulterants commonly used in India, such as
certain vegetable oils or animal fats
, may differ from those in other regions. Establishing baseline data for Indian adulterants would improve the precision of detecting the specific types of foreign fats used in India.
Accurate Interpretation of Results
: Without specific data on the composition of Indian cow ghee, it becomes
difficult to interpret
the results from methods like gas chromatography. Customized baseline data ensures that the detection methods yield accurate and meaningful conclusions in the Indian context.
Way forward:
Strengthen Enforcement Mechanisms
: Increase resources for testing facilities and train personnel to implement FSSAI standards more effectively, ensuring regular checks for sophisticated adulteration.
Develop India-Specific Testing Protocols
: Create testing standards based on baseline data specific to Indian cows and local adulterants to improve accuracy in detecting food adulteration.

Why in the News?
In the third year of the five-year
, larger cities have yet to clear land at half of their landfill sites. According to government sources, only 38% of the total waste has been remediated so far..
Present State of Cities in India (related to legacy landfills):
Inadequate Progress in Waste Remediation
: Three years into Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Urban 2.0, only 38% of the waste in legacy landfill sites across major cities has been remediated. About 62% of garbage still remains unprocessed, and 65% of the land has not been cleared.
Slow Progress in Large Cities
In major cities with populations over 1 million,
35 out of 69 landfill
sites have not had any land cleared.
Deonar landfill in Mumbai,
the largest in India, has not seen any remediation or land clearance.
Ahmedabad’s Pirana landfill,
48% of the total area has been cleared, while in Delhi’s Ghazipur and Bhalaswa landfills, waste remediation has begun, but no land has been reclaimed yet.
Challenges with Legacy and Fresh Waste
: Legacy landfills remain a persistent issue as fresh waste is still being deposited at the same sites undergoing remediation. This cycle hampers progress, as more fresh waste offsets the clearance of older waste, making remediation efforts inefficient.
Note: The Swachh Bharat Mission – Urban 2.0 (SBM-U 2.0),
launched on October 1, 2021, aims to achieve a “Garbage Free” India by 2026. It focuses on sustainable sanitation, effective waste management, and enhancing urban cleanliness through initiatives like
door-to-door waste collection
and remediation of legacy dumpsites.
What are the cities expected to do with reclaimed land?
Reuse Plans for Cleared Land
: According to SBM Urban 2.0 guidelines, cities are expected to reuse cleared land after bioremediation for productive purposes such as:
Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF)
: Waste is processed into RDF for use in waste-to-energy plants.
Construction and Demolition Waste Recycling
: Cleared waste is recycled for infrastructure projects.
Bio-soil
: Reclaimed bio-soil is used for road construction or other land development projects.
Limited Action on Reuse
: Despite these plans, the amount of land reclaimed from garbage dumps remains
minimal in many cities
, and detailed data on how reclaimed land is being utilized is lacking. As of now, the focus remains on remediation rather than immediate land reuse.
Way forward:
Develop Alternative Waste Processing Sites
: Cities must create dedicated facilities to manage fresh waste separately from legacy landfills to avoid offsetting progress and ensure efficient remediation.
Accelerate Land Reuse Plans
: Prioritize the swift repurposing of reclaimed land for productive uses, such as waste-to-energy plants, construction material recycling, and bio-soil applications, ensuring sustainable urban development.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Issues related to manual scavengers;
Why in the News?
Government data from over 3,000 urban local bodies across 29 States and Union Territories shows that 91.9% of the 38,000 sewer and septic tank cleaners profiles belong to SC, ST, or OBC communities.
What are the socio-economic conditions of workers engaged in sewer and septic tank cleaning?
Demographics
: A significant majority (91.9%) of the 38,000 profiled workers belong to marginalized communities: 68.9% Scheduled Castes (SC), 14.7% Other Backward Classes (OBC), 8.3% Scheduled Tribes (ST), and 8% from the general category.
Employment Status
: The workforce largely comprises low-income individuals engaged in hazardous, low-status jobs, reflecting persistent caste-based disparities.
Capital Subsidies support
: Since the launch of the NAMASTE program, ₹2.26 crore in capital subsidies have been distributed to 191 beneficiaries, indicating some financial support for transitioning into self-employment.
How effective are current policies and rehabilitation schemes for sanitation workers?
NAMASTE Programme
: Aimed at mechanizing sewer cleaning and providing safety training and equipment, the program is a replacement for the Self-Employment Scheme for
Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS).
Enumeration Process
: Over 3,326
urban local bodies (ULBs)
are involved, with 38,000 workers profiled so far. However, 283 ULBs reported zero workers, suggesting that the profiling might not be comprehensive or that many workers are unrecognized.
Rehabilitation Success
: Out of 58,098 identified manual scavengers under the previous SRMS scheme, 97.2% were from SC communities. While cash transfers of
₹40,000
were provided, only a fraction pursued skills training or loans for alternative livelihoods.
What are the challenges?
Social Stigma
: Predominantly from marginalized communities (SC, ST, OBC), these workers face discrimination, limiting their access to better job opportunities and social mobility.
Health Risks
: Exposure to hazardous working conditions leads to significant health risks, with a high mortality rate
(377 deaths from 2019 to 2023)
due to unsafe practices.
Ineffective Rehabilitation
: Current policies and support programs lack comprehensive coverage, leaving many workers unrecognized and limiting the effectiveness of financial assistance and training initiatives.
What are the health risks and safety measures for workers in hazardous cleaning roles?
Hazardous Working Conditions
: Between 2019 and 2023, 377 workers died from hazardous cleaning activities, highlighting the extreme risks associated with sewer and septic tank cleaning.
Safety Training
: The NAMASTE program aims to provide safety training for workers to minimize health risks, but the effectiveness of such training needs further evaluation.
Equipment and Mechanization
: The goal is to transition workers from manual cleaning to mechanized processes, reducing their exposure to dangerous conditions and improving overall safety.
Way forward:
Comprehensive Training and Support Programs
: Enhance the effectiveness of the
by providing robust safety training and resources for workers, coupled with extensive outreach to ensure all workers are identified and supported, including those currently unrecognized.
Promotion of Mechanization and Safety Standards
: Accelerate the mechanization of sewer cleaning operations to reduce health risks, and establish strict safety standards and regulations to protect workers, ensuring regular monitoring and enforcement of these standards.

Why in the News?
The
LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment
revealed that as we continue to push the boundaries of dark matter detection, the issue of neutrino fog becomes increasingly significant.
What is the
LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) Experiment?
The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment is a cutting-edge
detection project
located deep underground at the
Sanford Underground Research Facility
South Dakota, USA
It is one of the most sensitive experiments in the world designed to detect
dark matter particles
, which are believed to make up about
85% of the matter
in the universe but have not yet been directly observed.
The heart of the LZ experiment is a tank filled with
10 tonnes of liquid xenon
, a very dense and pure material.
The idea is that if a
collides with a
xenon atom
, it will produce a tiny burst of light and free electrons.
These interactions are then
detected by sensitive equipment
surrounding the xenon.
The experiment is located
1.5 km below the Earth’s surface
What is Neutrino Fog?
Neutrinos
, often referred to as “
ghost particles
,” are subatomic particles with nearly
zero mass and no electric charge.
“Neutrino Fog”
refers to the interference caused by
neutrinos
—subatomic particles that rarely interact with matter—in
dark matter detection experiments
Neutrinos are produced naturally in the
Sun’s core
supernovae
, and even
Earth’s atmosphere
Though they pass through most matter undetected, their weak interactions can cause small disturbances in highly sensitive detectors.
As
dark matter detectors
become larger and more sensitive, they are more likely to detect
, leading to a “fog” of signals that can obscure or mimic potential
dark matter interactions

Why in the News?
Recent research indicates that pigs may act as a transmission vehicle for a strain of the
hepatitis E virus (HEV)
commonly found in
rats
, known as
Rocahepevirus ratti, or rat HEV.
Role of Pigs in Transmission
HEV Reservoir
: Pigs naturally carry hepatitis E virus (HEV), particularly strains that can infect humans.
Transmission via Pork
: Humans can contract HEV by consuming raw or undercooked pork from infected pigs.
Environmental Contamination
: Infected pigs shed HEV in faeces, contaminating the environment and water sources, potentially spreading the virus to humans.
Poor sanitation in pig farms facilitates HEV transmission between pigs and increases the risk of human infection through the food chain.
Cross-Species Transmission
: Pigs may also act as intermediaries for
, transmitting the virus from rats to humans in farm environments.
About
Hepatitis E Virus (HEV):
Hepatitis E is caused by the
, which is a
positive-sense, single-stranded, non-enveloped RNA virus
HEV is classified under the family
Hepeviridae
, genus
Orthohepevirus
It was first identified during an outbreak among
Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan
in 1983.
The earliest well-documented HEV epidemic occurred in
New Delhi, India, in 1955
, retrospectively identified as HEV.
Transmission:
The primary route of transmission is
fecal-oral
, especially through contaminated water and food.
Zoonotic transmission
is possible with genotypes 3 and 4, commonly spread through undercooked meat or direct animal contact.
Symptoms:
Jaundice, nausea, fatigue, and elevated liver enzymes.
Severe cases can lead to

**********Dead Coral Skeletons hinder Reef Regeneration
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Coral Bleaching and Coral Regeneration
Why in the News?
A study conducted at Moorea, French Polynesia, has revealed that the network of
dead coral skeletons
left behind by bleaching events prevents reefs from regenerating.
About Corals
Corals are
marine invertebrates
made up of genetically identical organisms called
polyps
Polyps have a
mutualistic relationship
with microscopic algae called
zooxanthellae
that live within their tissues.
Zooxanthellae perform
photosynthesis
, providing the corals with carbohydrates, while the corals offer compounds needed for photosynthesis.
Corals have
calcium carbonate skeletons
, which help in building the reef structure.
Thousands of polyps combine to form coral colonies, which multiply and grow over time.
Coral reefs
are underwater ecosystems formed by the accumulation of
from corals.
Known as the
“rainforests of the seas”
, they provide habitat and protection for a wide variety of marine life.
Coral reefs are built by both
hard
soft corals
and grow over time as more corals attach to the reef structure.
They are the
largest living structures
on the planet, vital for marine biodiversity.
Challenges due to Dead Corals
Shelter for Seaweed
: Dead coral skeletons create a complex structure that offers protection to macroalgae (seaweed) from herbivores. This allows seaweed to colonize the reef quickly, outcompeting young coral.
Impeded Herbivory:
The complex landscape of dead corals prevents herbivores, which normally graze on algae, from accessing the macroalgae effectively. This leads to unchecked algae growth.
Increased Competition:
Macroalgae grow faster and reproduce more frequently than coral, leading to increased competition for space, light, and nutrients, which further inhibits young coral from settling and growing.
Annual Coral Reproduction:
Coral typically spawns only once a year, while algae reproduce continuously. This gives algae a competitive advantage in newly available spaces left by dead coral skeletons.
Altered Ecosystem Balance:
The presence of dead coral shifts the balance between herbivores, algae, and coral, making it difficult for the reef to regenerate naturally.
Conditions for Reef Regeneration
Flat Substrate:
After events like cyclones, which remove coral but leave behind a flat surface, reefs tend to recover more easily, as young coral can settle and regrow without much competition from macroalgae.
Herbivore Activity:
Active herbivory is crucial for reef recovery, as herbivores control the growth of macroalgae, allowing space for coral recruits to settle and thrive.
Clear Space for Coral Recruits:
To regenerate effectively, coral needs open space free from excessive algae. Removing dead coral skeletons might help create these conditions.
Frequent Disturbances:
Coral reefs are better adapted to recover from frequent but non-lethal disturbances like storms, which scrape off coral and allow for fresh regrowth, compared to bleaching events, which leave the dead coral structure intact.
Water Quality and Temperature:
Coral recovery depends on optimal water conditions, including the absence of pollutants and suitable temperatures.
PYQ:
[2018]
Consider the following statements
Most of the world’s coral reefs are in tropical waters.
More than one-third of the world’s coral reefs are located in the territories of Australia, Indonesia and Philippines.
Coral reefs host far more number of animal phyla than those hosted by tropical rainforests.
