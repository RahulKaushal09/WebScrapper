The Bhartiya Vayuyan Vidheyak Bill 2024
Why in News?
The Ministry of Civil Aviation tabled the “The Bhartiya Vayuyan Vidheyak Bill 2024” that replaces the Aircraft Act 1943, to put aside the colonial legacy of aviation - one of the most modern and hi-tech sectors.
The Aircraft Act 1934 is an act to make better provision for the control of the manufacture, possession, use, operation, sale, import and export of aircraft.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Need to Replace the Aircraft Act 1943
Objectives of the Bhartiya Vayuyan Vidheyak Bill 2024
What are the Major Additions in the Bhartiya Vayuyan Vidheyak Bill 2024?
Need to Replace the Aircraft Act 1943:
The Act has been amended several times
to enhance safety, oversight, and to meet requirements for sustainable growth of the aviation sector and to give effect to the provisions of international conventions.
As a result of numerous amendments,
a need is felt to address the ambiguities and confusion
experienced by the stakeholders,
To remove redundancies,
To simplify processes and improve ease of doing business,
To provide for design, manufacture, and maintenance of aircraft and related equipment.
Objectives of the Bhartiya Vayuyan Vidheyak Bill 2024:
The proposed legislation will bring the
Radio Telephone Operator Restricted (RTR) Certificate and Licence testing process
from the Department of Telecom (DoT) to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (
DGCA
).
This would ease the process
for pilots as they can secure all their certificates from one authority.
Empower the Central Government -
To make rules to implement the Convention relating to international civil aviation and other matters relating to civil aviation security.
To issue orders in emergencies in the interest of public safety or tranquility.
Provide for payment of compensation
for loss or damage in such manner as provided under the Act.
Provide for appeals
against matters relating to compensation, licenses, certificates, or approvals, and adjudication of penalties.
Provide for imprisonment, fines, or penalties
for contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder.
The government has changed the definition of what qualifies as an aircraft
, with balloons and gliders removed.
The Bill empowers the Central Government to make rules -
Regulating the design, manufacture, maintenance, possession, use, operation, sale, export, or import of any aircraft or class of aircraft and
For securing the safety of aircraft operations.
The new bill has given more powers
, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) over the safety of the aviation environment in the country.
It empowers the Central Government or any officer
to suspend, cancel, or restrict any license or certification
granted under the Act.
However, an opportunity for hearing must be given to the affected party prior to passing such an order.
A concept of second appeal
against such an order has also been added.
So earlier there was one appeal and then a final appeal to the Secretary MoCA.
Now an interim appeal in between has been added.

**********Wayanad ranked high on ISRO ‘Landslide Atlas’
Why in news?
Wayanad, currently reeling from the deadly July 30 landslide disaster, was among several places in Kerala identified by the ISRO in 2023 as being highly susceptible to landslides based on key socio-economic parameters.
In the Landslide Atlas of India, prepared by the National Remote Sensing Centre (a unit of ISRO) in February 2023,
Wayanad ranked 13th
among 147 districts across 17 States and two Union Territories.
Meanwhile, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode ranked third, fifth, seventh, and tenth, respectively.
What’s in today’s article?
About
The Landslide Atlas of India, prepared by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of ISRO, details landslide occurrences and damage assessments in landslide-prone areas of India.
It covers 147 districts in 17 states and two Union Territories in the Himalayas and Western Ghats.
The geospatial landslide inventory database includes approximately 80,000 landslides mapped from 1998 to 2022,
categorized into three types: seasonal, event-based, and route-wise inventories
The seasonal inventory documents landslides from the 2014 and 2017 rainy seasons.
The event-based inventory includes major events like the Kedarnath and Kerala disasters and the Sikkim earthquake.
The route-wise inventory covers landslides along significant tourist and pilgrimage routes.
The mapping utilized high to very high-resolution satellite data, including IRS-1D, Resourcesat, Cartosat, Sentinel, Pleiades, and WorldView, as well as aerial images, with some landslides validated in the field.
The data was used to rank districts based on their exposure to landslides, considering key socio-economic parameters.
Key findings
Uttarakhand, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh
reported the highest number of landslides during 1998 – 2022.
Mizoram topped the list, recording 12,385 landslide events in the past 25 years
, of which 8,926 were recorded in 2017 alone.
Likewise, 2,071 events of the total 2,132 landslides reported in Nagaland during this period occurred during the 2017 monsoon season.
Manipur, too, showed a similar trend, wherein 4,559 out of 5,494 landslide events were experienced during the rainy season of 2017.
Among all these states, an alarming situation is emerging from Uttarakhand and Kerala.
Uttarakhand’s fragility was recently exposed during the land subsidence events reported from Joshimath since January.
The state has experienced the
second highest number (11,219) of landslides since 1998
Kerala has been consistently reporting massive landslides since it suffered the century’s worst floods in 2018.
The year-wise landslide events here are 2018 (5,191), 2019 (756), 2020 (9) and 2021 (29).
Most Vulnerable District
From the events and images obtained, the NRSC ranked
Rudraprayag
in Uttarakhand at the top of 147 vulnerable districts.
It has the highest landslide density in the country, along with having the highest exposure to total population and number of houses.

**********Hamas chief assassinated
Why in news?
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran early on July 31. The 62-year-old leader, who had been
managing Hamas’s political operations from exile in Qatar
, reportedly died in what Hamas described as an Israeli “strike” on his residence.
The Israeli military has not commented on the incident so far.
What’s in today’s article?
Key takeaways from this assassination
About
Hamas is the largest Palestinian militant Islamist group and one of the two major political parties in the region.
Currently, it governs more than two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
The organisation, however, is also known for its armed resistance against Israel (more on this later).
Hamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is
designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries
Background
The group was founded in the late 1980s, after the beginning of the
first Palestinian intifada
, or uprising, against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Hamas is essentially the internal metamorphosis of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood.
Reasons for its creation
The main reason for Hamas’ creation was a deep sense of failure that had been set within the Palestinian national movement by the late 1980s.
This primarily happened after the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) — involved in the armed struggle against Israel from the mid-1960s to ‘liberate Palestine’ — made two massive concessions.
PLO recognized Israel and its right to exist
— thereby, relinquishing its goal of liberating Palestine.
Two, it also
dropped the armed struggle as a strategy
, for the sake of a negotiated settlement.
Hamas gained prominence after it opposed the Oslo Peace Accords signed in the early 1990s between Israel and the PLO.
India’s stand on Hamas
So far,
India has not declared Hamas as a terrorist organisation
New Delhi neither recognizes Hamas nor describes it as a terrorist group but pursues a delicate balance between its support for the Palestinian cause and opposition to terrorism.
After the 7 October attack, PM Modi expressed deep shock and solidarity with Israel. However, he did not mention Hamas or Palestine.
Since then, India has spoken of the need for a two-state solution to the wider Israel-Palestine conflict.
Key takeaways from assassination of Hamas chief
Ismail Haniyeh, the Qatar-based public face of Hamas, killed in Iran
assassinated in Iran
in what might mark a defining moment in the ongoing war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group.
Haniyeh was killed in Tehran, where he had gone to attend the inauguration of the newly-elected Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.
Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari is also in Tehran at the moment for Pezeshkian’s inauguration.
As a result, Iran has vowed to avenge the killing.
This also signals that
Hamas leaders are not safe in Iran and in Iran’s protection
In April this year, Iran and Israel had exchanged a round of missile and drone attacks at each other.
Temperatures had cooled since then, but this assassination has the potential to trigger further hostilities.
Wider conflict in the Middle East
The killing, hours after an Israeli strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut, heightens fears of wider conflict in the Middle East.
Hezbollah had confirmed that its commander Fuad Shukr was killed in that strike.
For Israel - a success
On October 7, 2023, Hamas killed at least 1,200 Israeli civilians and military personnel, and took about 250 hostages.
Since then, the Israeli military has pounded Gaza with air strikes and ground operations, with the stated aim of going after Hamas leaders.
From the Israeli point of view, this is a major victory in its mission to neutralise Hamas — a stated objective behind launching the Operation Swords of Iron.
Haniyeh is the most highly placed Hamas figure to have been killed so far.
For Hamas - a provocation
From Hamas’ perspective, however, this is a major provocation since Haniyeh was the head of its political bureau, based in Qatar.
He was the public face of Hamas, and was negotiating the terms of the hostages deal and the ceasefire.
Yahya Sinwar is the military leader who was responsible for the October 7 attacks.
Pressure on Newly elected President of Iran
Within Iran and Hamas, there will now be calls for avenging Haniyeh’s death.
These are certain to put pressure on the newly-elected moderate President Prezeshkian.
The president’s election campaign focussed on beginning negotiations with the West, primarily for economic reasons given how damaging Western sanctions have been for Iran. He would have hoped to restart dialogue with Europe, to begin with.
But, with Haniyeh’s assassination, Pezeshkian will be under pressure from the IRGC and the hardliners in the Iranian establishment to respond in kind.
West Asia a tinderbox
For the region as a whole, the assassination is not good news, especially if Iran and Hamas escalate. Such an escalation will impact all of West Asia.
Qatar, Turkey, and the Yemeni Houthis have already condemned the assassination, and the top regional players like Saudi Arabia, UAE are watching the events closely.
India to carefully frame its response
India is cautious about responding to the situation involving Hamas leaders due to the complexity of a targeted assassination on foreign soil.
New Delhi's primary concern is maintaining peace and stability in the region, which hosts about nine million Indian expatriates and supplies almost two-thirds of India's crude oil.

**********RBI Proposes Regulation for Safer Digital Payments
Why in the News?
The RBI released a draft circular proposing an Alternative Factor Authentication for all transactions in a move to prioritize security of digital payments, according to its statement on July 31.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Authentication Process (Meaning, Types, etc.)
About Alternative Factor Authentication (Meaning, Types, Benefits, etc.)
News Summary
Authentication Process in Digital Payments:
Authentication in the context of digital payments is the process of verifying the identity of a user or the validity of a transaction to ensure security and prevent fraud.
This process ensures that the person initiating the payment is authorized to do so and that the transaction is legitimate.
Basic Types of Authentication Methods for Digital Payments:
Password-Based Authentication:
Users enter a unique password to confirm their identity.
PIN-Based Authentication:
Users enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to authorize transactions.
Biometric Authentication:
Utilizes unique biological characteristics such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
Combines two different methods of authentication, typically something the user knows (password) and something the user has (mobile device).
Usage:
Enhances security for online transactions and account access.
One-Time Password (OTP):
A temporary password generated for a single transaction or session, sent to the user's registered mobile number or email.
Token-Based Authentication:
Uses a hardware or software token to generate a unique code that the user must enter to authenticate.
Smart Card Authentication:
Involves the use of a smart card containing embedded integrated circuits to authenticate the user.
QR Code Authentication:
Users scan a QR code with their mobile device to authenticate and authorize payments.
What is Alternative Factor Authentication in Digital Transactions?
Alternative Factor Authentication (AFA) refers to using unconventional or additional methods beyond the traditional authentication factors to verify the identity of a user in digital transactions.
This approach enhances security by incorporating multiple layers of verification, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access.
Types of AFA:
Behavioural Biometrics:
Analyses patterns in user behaviour, such as typing speed, mouse movements, and navigation habits.
Device-Based Authentication:
Uses information about the device being used, such as its IP address, geolocation, and device ID.
Risk-Based Authentication:
Assesses the risk level of a transaction based on factors like transaction amount, location, and user behaviour.
Contextual Authentication:
Considers the context of the transaction, such as time of day, previous transaction history, and user preferences.
Push Notification Authentication:
Sends a push notification to a user’s registered mobile device for transaction approval.
Voice Recognition:
Uses the user’s unique voice patterns for authentication.
Email/SMS Verification Codes:
Sends a verification code to the user’s registered email or phone number.
Geolocation Verification:
Uses the user’s geographic location as an authentication factor.
Benefits of AFA:
Enhanced Security:
By incorporating multiple and varied authentication factors, AFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and fraud.
Flexibility:
Provides users with various authentication options, improving the user experience.
Fraud Detection:
Helps in detecting fraudulent activities by analysing unusual patterns and behaviours.
RBI Proposes Regulation for Safer Digital Payments:
On July 31, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released a
draft circular proposing Alternative Factor Authentication (AFA) for all digital transactions, emphasizing enhanced security for digital payments
The draft outlines principles for authenticating digital payments, mandating an additional robust factor of authentication that must be dynamically generated and used only once.
The type of
authentication factor will depend on various parameters, including the customer's risk profile and the transaction value
The RBI also requires compulsory customer consent for introducing a new authentication factor, along with the option for customers to withdraw consent and deregister.
Exemptions from this proposal include contactless card transactions below ₹5000, insurance premiums, credit card payments above ₹1,00,000, and other categories up to ₹15,000.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Endogenous Retroviruses and their significance in human evolution
Why in the News?
Research suggests that around
8% of the human genome is composed of Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs)
often referred to as
‘zombie’ regions.
Retroviruses and Human Genome Integration
Most
viruses can’t affect the human genome
, but retroviruses are an exception.
can integrate and reshape the genomes of their hosts.
They have an
RNA genome
can reverse-transcribe it to DNA
, inserting it into the host’s genome.
This process is
facilitated by the enzyme
reverse transcriptase.
Discovered by Howard Temin and David Baltimore in 1971
, this enzyme converts the virus’s RNA into a corresponding DNA sequence.
Historical Discoveries:
Viral causes of cancer were known even before the mechanism was understood.
In 1908, Oluf Bang and Vilhelm Ellermann discovered the viral cause of chicken leukosis.
In 1957, Ludwik Gross isolated a leukaemia-causing virus in mice.
What are Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs)?
ERVs are
remnants of ancient viral infections
that have integrated into the genome of the host species.
When these
retroviruses infect germ cells
sperm or egg cells
), their genetic material can be passed down to the next generation,
becoming a permanent part of the host’s DNA
Zombie Regions:
They refer to
inactive viral sequences within the genome
that no longer produce functional viruses
but remain as embedded genetic fossils.
These regions are a
result of retrovirus integration
that has lost its ability to replicate and produce proteins, yet they persist in the host’s DNA.
Evolutionary Significance of ERVs:
In the life cycle of a retrovirus,
reverse-transcribed DNA
integrated into the host’s DNA
with the
help of integrase
viral DNA,
called a
provirus
hijacks human cells
, turning them into virus-making factories.
Over tens of thousands of years,
many retroviruses have left genomic elements
in human genome
, contributing to evolutionary processes.
Example:
Syncytins
are genes thought to have descended from ERVs and are crucial for
placental development.
These genes originally came from viruses and were acquired during mammalian evolution.
Their Contribution to Human Biology

**********On discarding indexation for LTCG    
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Indexation, Capital Gains Tax Regime.
Mains level:
Significance of indexation
Why in the news?
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s decision to eliminate indexation for calculating long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax in the Union Budget has received a lukewarm response from stakeholders.
What is long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax?
LTCG refers to the profit realized from the sale of an asset that has been held for
more than one year.
This includes various types of assets such as
stocks, bonds, real estate, and mutual funds.
If an
asset is sold before this holding period, the gains are classified as short-term capital gains (STCG)
and are taxed at different rates.
Why has the Union Finance Minister done away with indexation for computing long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax?
Simplification of Tax Computation
: The Finance Minister proposed the change to
“ease computation of capital gains for the taxpayer and tax administration.”
The intention is to simplify the tax process.
Uniform Tax Rate
: Long-term gains on
all financial and non-financial assets
would now be taxed at a flat rate of 12.5%, replacing the previous tiered structure.
High real estate return:
The Income Tax department believes that the
real estate returns (12-16% per annum) are higher than indexation for inflation (4-5%)
. Thus, it predicts “substantial tax savings” for a “vast majority” of taxpayers under the new system.
What is indexation?
Indexation is a mechanism used to
adjust the original purchase price of an asset to account for inflation.
It helps in
calculating the real gains and prevents inflation
from inflating the tax liability. The adjusted purchase price is called the indexed cost of acquisition.
How does Indexation help in Tax Savings?
Adjusts the purchase price for inflation:
increases the original purchase price of an asset
to account for inflation between the time of purchase and sale. This results in a lower taxable capital gain.
Reduces the taxable capital gains:
By revising the purchase price upwards using the Cost Inflation Index, indexation
reduces the difference between the sale price and purchase price.
This lowers the taxable capital gains amount.
Leads to lower tax liability:
With a reduced taxable capital gain,
the tax payable on it also decreases
. For example, on a ₹48 lakh gain from selling a house, indexation can bring down the taxable gain to ₹28.6 lakh, saving ₹4,264 in tax (assuming 20% LTCG rate).
What has been the feedback from corporates and industry regarding the move?
Concerns Over Increased Tax Liability:
Many stakeholders expressed apprehension that the removal of indexation
would lead to higher tax obligations for ordinary investors
, particularly in the real estate sector.
There are fears that this might encourage the undervaluation of properties to reduce capital gains tax and potentially
increase black money transactions in real estate.
Mixed Reactions from Realty Players:
While some real estate developers and consultants indicated that the removal of indexation
might not significantly impact demand and prices,
especially for primary home buyers, they noted that high-end properties could see a drop in demand.
Some developers viewed the changes positively and said that the
lowered tax rate (from 20% to 12.5%) could make real estate a more attractive long-term investment.
Government Justifications and Clarifications:
The government has argued that the new tax regime
simplifies the capital gains tax structure
and is beneficial for most taxpayers.
Way forward:
Transitional Provisions
: Govt. should implement transitional provisions for existing investments to ease the shift from the old system to the new one.
Strengthen the monitoring system:
Need to strengthen monitoring mechanisms to prevent the undervaluation of properties and reduce black money transactions.

Present Scenario of ‘Data Race vs. Ethics’
Data Demand vs. Quality:
The race for data has intensified as AI systems, particularly
Large Language Models (LLMs),
require vast amounts of
high-quality data for training.
However, there is a growing concern that this demand may compromise
ethical standards, leading to the use of pirated or low-quality datasets
, such as the controversial ‘Books3’ collection of pirated texts.
What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems that can understand and generate human-like text by learning from vast amounts of data, enabling a wide range of language-related applications.
Feedback Loops and Bias Amplification:
The reliance on existing datasets can create feedback loops that
exacerbate biases present in the data.
As AI models are trained on flawed datasets, they may
perpetuate and amplify these biases, resulting in skewed outputs
that reflect an unbalanced and often Anglophone-centric worldview.
Ethical Considerations:
The urgency to acquire data can
overshadow ethical considerations
. This
raises questions about the fairness and accountability of AI systems
, as they may be built on datasets that do not represent the diversity of human knowledge and culture.
Challenges towards the Sources
Lack of Primary Sources:
Current LLMs are
primarily trained on secondary sources
, which often
lack the depth and richness
of primary cultural artefacts.
Important primary sources, such as
archival documents and oral traditions,
are frequently overlooked, limiting the diversity of data available for AI training.
Underutilization of Cultural Heritage:
Many repositories of cultural heritage, such as
state archives, remain untapped for AI training.
These archives contain vast amounts of
linguistic and cultural data
that could enhance AI’s understanding of humanity’s diverse history and knowledge.
Digital Divide:
The digitization of cultural heritage is often deprioritized, l
eading to a lack of access to valuable data
that could benefit AI development.
This gap in data availability disproportionately
affects smaller companies and startups,
hindering innovation and competition with larger tech firms.
Case Studies from Italy and Canada
Italy’s Digital Library Initiative:
Italy allocated €500 million from its
‘Next Generation EU’
package to develop a
‘Digital Library’ project aimed at making its rich cultural heritage accessible as open data.
However, this initiative has
faced setbacks and deprioritization,
highlighting the
challenges of sustaining investment in cultural digitization.
Canada’s Official Languages Act:
This policy, once criticized for
being wasteful, ultimately produced one of the most valuable datasets for training translation software.
Conclusion:
There is a need to implement robust ethical guidelines and standards for data collection and usage in AI training. These standards should ensure that datasets are sourced legally, represent diverse cultures and perspectives, and minimize biases. Encourage collaborations between tech companies, governments, and cultural institutions to develop and adhere to these guidelines.
**********SEBI’s proposed measures to curb F&O speculation    
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Types of derivatives
Mains level:
Measures taken by SEBI related to derivatives
Why in the news?
SEBI has proposed a series of
curb speculative trading in the index derivatives segment due to concerns over the exponential increase in trading volumes in futures and options,
especially among individual investors.
What are the different types of derivatives?
Note:
Derivatives are financial contracts deriving their value from an underlying asset such as stocks, commodities, or currencies.
Futures:
Futures are standardized contracts obligating the buyer to
purchase an underlying asset (such as stocks, commodities, or currencies)
at a predetermined price on a specified future date. They are traded on exchanges, with daily settlements based on market price changes.
Futures contracts have
margin requirements and are marked to market daily,
ensuring liquidity and reducing credit risk.
Options:
Options give the
buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified time frame.
Unlike futures, options are
not obligatory
; the buyer can choose whether to exercise the option.
Options can be traded on exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) and require the payment of a premium by the buyer.
Forwards:
Forward contracts are similar to futures but are
privately negotiated agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a future date and price.
They are customizable and traded over the counter, which allows for flexibility but introduces counterparty risk.
Settlement occurs at the maturity date, and forward contracts do not have standardization like futures.
Swaps:
Swaps involve the exchange of
cash flows or financial instruments between two parties
, often
based on interest rates or currencies.
Common types include interest rate swaps and currency swaps, which allow participants to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations or gain access to different currencies.
Swaps are typically traded over the counter and can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the parties involved.
What measures have the SEBI proposed?
Increase in
minimum contract size
index derivatives from Rs 5-10 lakh to Rs 15-20 lakh
, which can be further
increased to Rs 20-30 lakh after six months.
Upfront collection
of option premiums by
brokers from clients.
Intraday monitoring of position limits for
index derivative contracts by Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs).
Providing
only one weekly options
contract on a single benchmark index of an exchange.
Removal of calendar spread benefits on the expiry day for positions involving any of the contracts expiring on the same day.
Rationalisation of options strikes, with a
uniform interval up to a fixed coverage of 4% near the prevailing index price
and an increased interval as the strikes move away from the prevailing price.
Increasing margins on the expiry day and the previous day
to address the issue of high implicit leverage in options contracts near expiry.
Why have these measures been proposed?
The measures
aim to enhance investor protection and promote market stability
in the derivative markets, amidst concerns about an exponential rise in the volume of trade in the futures and options (F&O) segment, particularly by individual investors.
In the Union Budget 2024-25, the
Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on F&O of securities
was
doubled to 0.02% and 0.1%,
respectively, effective October 1, 2024.
Data shows that in FY 2023-24, 92.50 lakh unique individuals and proprietorship firms traded in the NSE index derivatives segment and cumulatively incurred a trading loss of Rs 51,689 crore, with only 14.22 lakh investors (about 15%) making a net profit.
Way forward:
Enhancing Investor Education and Awareness:
To mitigate the risks associated with speculative trading in index derivatives, it is essential to implement comprehensive investor education programs.
Strengthening Regulatory Oversight and Compliance:
SEBI should enhance its regulatory framework by implementing robust monitoring systems that ensure compliance with the proposed measures.
**********Why the Ukraine war makes India and Europe important for each other?    
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Bordering countries of Russia and Ukraine
Mains level:
India’s geopolitical priorities
Why in the news?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s anticipated visit to Ukraine next month should signify a reconfiguration of India’s strategy towards European security.
European Scenario
The war in Ukraine has put
the question of Europe right at the top of India’s international agenda
, necessitating a reconfiguration of India’s approach to European security.
India should see the
war in Ukraine as an imperative for long overdue re-engagement with European peace and security,
moving beyond treating it as a
“pressure point”
from the West or a moment for solidarity with Russia.
Europe is facing hard
geopolitical dilemmas, torn between criticizing China, pleasing the US, and dealing with a resentful Russia
willing to restructure the European security order.
India’s peace diplomacy in Ukraine, even in a limited way, would be
worthwhile given the implications of the war for the Indian economy and security
, as history shows that China benefits from conflicts between Russia and the West.
India’s Priorities
Re-engagement with European Security:
The war in Ukraine has prompted I
ndia to reassess its approach to European geopolitics
, which has been largely neglected in recent decades. India aims to
strengthen its political and diplomatic ties with Europe,
recognizing it as a crucial economic partner and a significant source of technology.
Balancing Relations with Russia and the West:
India has maintained a c
areful balance in its relations with Russia while also courting Western powers.
The historical ties with Russia, particularly in defence and energy, remain vital for India, especially as it increases its imports of discounted Russian oil.
Addressing Security Challenges:
The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has complicated India’s security landscape, particularly with China’s growing ties to Russia and its strategic manoeuvres in Europe. India should
navigate these complexities while ensuring its own security interests are safeguarded.
Promoting Peace Diplomacy:
India is positioning itself as a
mediator in the Ukraine conflict,
emphasizing the importance of peace and dialogue. This diplomatic role
not only enhances India’s global standing but also aligns with its long-term interests in promoting stability
in a multipolar world.
Future outlook
India’s evolving global priorities reflect its ambition to assert itself as a significant player in i
nternational affairs, pursuing economic growth, security, and sustainable development
while contributing to the emergence of a multipolar world order.
India’s role in shaping
the future of global governance will continue to evolve as it navigates complex geopolitical dynamics
and works towards its national interests and the common good of the international community.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s likely visit to Ukraine next month should mark a
reconfiguration of India’s approach to European security,
as the return of war to Europe has created multiple economic challenges for India and complicated its security challenges.
Way forward:
Proactive Diplomacy
: India should actively engage with European countries and institutions to strengthen political and diplomatic ties.
Peace Mediation Efforts
: India can leverage its
neutral stance and diplomatic relations
to facilitate peace dialogues and mediation efforts in the Ukraine conflict.
