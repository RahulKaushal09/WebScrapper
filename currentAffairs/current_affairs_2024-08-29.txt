**********What are Deepfakes?
South Korea’s president recently ordered a crackdown on an epidemic of digital sex crimes targeting women and girls who become the unwitting victims of deepfake pornography.
About Deepfakes:
Deepfakes are synthetic media, including images, videos, and audio,
generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI)
technology that
portray something that does not exist
in reality
or events that have never occurred.
The term deepfake
combines deep, taken from
AI deep-learning technology
(a type of machine learning that involves multiple levels of processing), and fake, addressing that the content is not real.
It
can create people who do not exist
, and it can fake real people saying and doing things they did not say or do.
Background: The origin of the word “deepfake” can be traced back to 2017, when a Reddit user with the username “deepfakes”, posted explicit videos of celebrities.
Working:
They are created by
machine learning models
, which
use neural networks
manipulate images and videos
To make a deepfake video of someone,
a creator would first train
neural network on many hours of real video
footage of the person
to give it a realistic “understanding"
of what he or she looks like from many angles and under different lighting.
Then
they combine the trained network with computer-graphics
techniques to superimpose a copy of the person onto a different actor.
Deepfake technology is now being
used for nefarious purposes
like scams and hoaxes
celebrity pornography, election manipulation
social engineering
, automated disinformation attacks, identity theft, and financial fraud.
They differ from other forms of false information by being
very difficult to identify as false.

**********PM 2.5 pollution dipped in 2022 in India
Why in news?
A study by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) found that favorable meteorological conditions and slightly reduced emissions led to a decrease in PM2.5 pollution in India between 2021 and 2022. This, in turn, has contributed to a one-year increase in the country's average life expectancy.
The report also underlined that meeting the World Health Organization (WHO)’s pollution guidelines would increase Delhi residents’ life expectancy by 7.8 years.
What’s in today’s article?
WHO’s revised air quality guidelines 2021
Key highlights of the report
In September 2021, the WHO has strengthened its air quality guidelines.
The revised norms recommend air quality levels for
six pollutants
:
Ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide.
The other two are PM10 and PM2.5 -- particulate matter equal or smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter.
The recommended levels for all the six pollutants have been revised
downwards from the
existing norms that have been in place since 2005
The WHO norms are
not binding
on any country.
About the report
The annual report, "
Air Quality Life Index" 2024
, has been released by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).
The report involves an annual assessment of air quality worldwide, highlighting regions where standards have not been met and instances of policy successes and failures.
A dip in particulate pollution (PM2.5) in India between 2021 and 2022
India recorded a significant 19.3% drop in particulate pollution in 2022 compared to 2021, the second-highest reduction in the world after Bangladesh.
Decline in particulate pollution added an average of 51 days to the life expectancy of every citizen.
The researchers attributed this decline to favourable meteorological conditions and a reduced number of thermal inversions.
During thermal inversions, a layer of warm air traps cooler air near the ground, causing pollution to build up.
Need to meet the WHO's annual PM2.5 concentration standard
Indians are likely to lose 3.6 years of life expectancy if the country fails to meet the WHO's annual PM2.5 concentration standard of 5 micrograms per cubic metre.
PM2.5 concentrations in India in 2022 were around 9 micrograms per cubic metre, 19.3% lower than 2021.
Most significant declines
The most significant declines were observed in Purulia and Bankura districts of West Bengal, followed by Dhanbad, Purbi, Paschim Singhbhum, Paschim Medinipur and Bokaro districts in Jharkhand.
In each of these districts, PM2.5 concentrations dropped by over 20 micrograms per cubic metre.
India's population still living in areas exceeding the national air quality standard
42.6% of India's population still lived in areas exceeding the national air quality standard.
The report emphasizes that while air pollution remains the greatest external threat to life expectancy, setting and enforcing ambitious air quality standards could significantly improve public health.
Impact of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)
The report said that PM2.5 concentrations declined by 19% on average in districts with cities covered by India's flagship programme on air quality management, the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).
Launched in 2019, the NCAP is India's first national effort to set clean air targets.
It aims for a 20-30% reduction in particulate pollution by 2024, using 2017 as the base year.
The revised target is a
40% reduction by 2026, with 2019-20 as the base year
The programme covers
131 non-attainment cities
, which consistently failed to meet the prescribed national ambient air quality standards between 2011 and 2015.
Districts not covered by the programme saw a 16% decline.
Innovative practices highlighted by the report
In 2019, Gujarat launched the
world's first market for particulate pollution
, which has since reduced pollution by 20-30% in Surat and is rapidly expanding to other cities and states.
These types of innovative policies demonstrate that it is possible to achieve improvements in air quality and people's health, without unduly impeding economic growth.
The report also praised India's clean cooking programme, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana.
The decline in emissions from the residential sector in India can largely be attributed to the nationwide rollout of this scheme.
It attributed the reduction in transport-related emissions to the decreased use of diesel in the transport sector.

**********Himachal Bill raises women’s marriage age
Why in news?
The Himachal Pradesh Assembly has passed the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Himachal Pradesh Amendment) Bill, 2024. The Bill proposed to raise the minimum age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years.
In order to do so, the bill amended the Prohibition of Child Marriage (PCM) Act, which was passed by Parliament in 2006.
What’s in today’s article?
Debate surrounding the minimum age for marriage for girls
Himachal bill to raise women’s marriage age
The demand to raise the minimum age for marriage for girls to 21 in India has been growing due to several social, economic, and health-related factors:
Gender Equality and Education
Higher Education
: Raising the marriage age allows girls more time to complete their education. This will improve their career prospects.
Empowerment
: Delaying marriage can help empower women by giving them more time to develop skills and become financially independent.
Health and Well-being
Maternal Health
: Early marriage often leads to early pregnancies, which are associated with higher risks of maternal and infant mortality.
Raising the marriage age allows girls to attain physical and emotional maturity, leading to safer pregnancies and better health outcomes for both mothers and children.
Child Development
: Delaying motherhood gives women the opportunity to provide better care and nurturing to their children.
They are more likely to be emotionally and economically prepared.
Reducing Child Marriage
Combatting Child Marriage
: Child marriage is still prevalent in some parts of India, leading to various social issues such as domestic violence, lack of education, and poverty.
Economic Development
Workforce Participation
: Delaying marriage can increase women's participation in the workforce, which contributes to economic development.
Key challenges
Different age for attaining majority and being allowed to marry
The Bill increases the minimum age of marriage for females to 21 years, bringing it on par with that for males.
However, the age of attaining majority is 18 years under the Majority Act, 1875.
This difference may have consequences regarding the rights and responsibilities of persons between 18 and 21 years of age.
Inconsistencies between the minimum age for marriage and various SC Judgements
In 2018, the SC said that right to marry is part of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.
In another case in 2018, the Court held that when two adults consensually choose each other as life partners, it is a manifestation of their choice.
This choice is recognised under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution.
The current Bill restricts the right to marry before the age of 21 years.
Hence it raises question about the reasonableness of restriction for those between the ages of 18 and 21 years.
For any restriction of fundamental rights by law, there needs to be three criteria.
These are: a public purpose, the restriction having a nexus with such purpose, and absence of a less intrusive way to achieve the purpose.
Implementation challenges
There has been limited success in curbing marriage of girls below the age of 18 years.
In 2020, only 785 cases were registered under the 2006 act highlighting the fact that the detection of such marriages remains low.
This raises the question of whether the increase in the minimum age would have any significant impact in reducing child marriages.
The Himachal Pradesh Bill amends the Prohibition of Child Marriage (PCM) Act by raising the minimum marriage age for both males and females to 21 years, eliminating the previous age distinction.
The Bill defines a "child" as anyone under 21, regardless of gender, and gives this new age limit overriding authority over any other law or cultural practice that might permit earlier marriage.
Additionally, it extends the time frame for filing a petition to annul a child marriage, allowing individuals to do so within five years of reaching the age of majority, giving them until the age of 23 to annul the marriage.
Legislative Process and Constitutional Implications of Himachal Pradesh's Marriage Age Bill
The Himachal Pradesh Bill seeks to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage (PCM) Act by raising the minimum marriage age for women to 21 years, conflicting with the central law that sets it at 18.
Since
marriage is a subject under the Concurrent List
, both the central and state governments can legislate on it.
However, when a state law contradicts a central law, Article 254(1) of the Constitution renders the conflicting part of the state law void unless the President gives assent under Article 254(2).
The Bill must therefore be reserved for President's consideration by the Governor of Himachal Pradesh.
President’s assent is necessary for the Bill to become law
, similar to the process seen with Uttarakhand’s Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill.

**********Himachal Bill raises women’s marriage age  
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCM Act);
Mains level:
Significance of raising the marriage age for women from 18 to 21 years ;
Why in the News?
The
Himachal Pradesh Assembly passed a Bill
on tuesday to increase the
minimum marriage age for women from 18 to 21 years.
Why did the Himachal Pradesh Assembly pass the Bill?
For Empowerment:
The bill aims to provide them with
more opportunities for education, career development, and overall personal growth.
For Health and Well-being:
The Bill addresses the
adverse health impacts associated with early marriage and motherhood,
emphasizing the importance of allowing women to
mature physically before starting a family.
For Social Justice:
The bill aims for equal opportunities and ensures that women are not deprived of opportunities due to early marriag
e.
What is the
PCM) Act?
The PCM Act, 2006 is a significant piece of legislation in India aimed at
preventing child marriages and protecting the rights of children.
Under the Act, a
“child”
is defined as a male who has not completed 21 years of age and a female who has not completed 18 years of age.
What are the new proposed Amendments to the PCM Act?
Uniform Marriage Age:
The Bill amends
Section 2(a) of the PCM Act,
redefining a
as any
male or female who has not completed 21 years of age,
eliminating the previous gender-based distinction.
Overriding Clause:
Section 2(b) to include a clause that gives the new marriage age an overriding effect over any other law, custom, or usage,
making it
universally applicable in Himachal Pradesh.
Extension of Annulment Period:
The Bill increases the period for filing a petition to annul a child marriage from two years after attaining majority to five years,
allowing both men and women to annul their marriage until they turn 23.
How will the Bill’s amendments to the PCM Act come into force?
Concurrent List Consideration:
Marriage is a subject under the
Concurrent List,
allowing both the central and state governments to legislate on it. However, the Bill introduces amendments to a central law, making it potentially
“repugnant”
PCM Act.
Note:
In the legal context,
refers to a situation where a law enacted by a state legislature conflicts with or is contradictory to an existing central law on the same subject.
Article 254(1):
If there is a conflict between a central law and a state law on a subject listed in the Concurrent List, the
central law will prevail
, and the
repugnant portion of the state law will be considered void.
Governor’s Assent:
As the Bill amends a central law, it
must be reserved for the President’s consideration under Article 254(2) of the Constitution
after being passed by the state Assembly and receiving the Governor’s assent.
President’s Approval:
The Bill will become law only
if the President of India gives her assent.
This process ensures that the
state’s amendments are consistent with the Constitution and central laws.
Way Forward:
Align with National Law:
Coordinate with the central government to harmonize the amended marriage age with national legislation, ensuring legal consistency.
Community Awareness:
Implement targeted awareness campaigns to educate the public on the benefits of delaying marriage, emphasizing women’s education and health.

**********Sharpening India’s anti-tuberculosis fight     
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About BPaL/M;
Why in the News?
In the present context, in India, there are groundbreaking new treatments available, but we need to rethink and update the program to eliminate TB.
Current status of TB in India:
Incidence Rate:
As of
2022,
the incidence rate of TB in India was reported at
199 cases per 100,000 population, a decline from 237 per lakh population in 2015.
This reflects a
16% decrease in new TB cases since 2015.
Prevalence:
The estimated prevalence of
tuberculosis infection (TBI) among individuals over 15 years of age was around 31%
according to a
national survey
conducted from
2019 to 2021.
Global Contribution:
India accounted for
approximately 26% of the global incidence of TB cases in 2020.
In that year, India also represented
38% of global TB deaths
among HIV-negative individuals.
Mortality Rate:
The mortality rate due to TB
decreased
28 per lakh population in 2015 to 23 per lakh population in 2022,
indicating progress in managing the disease.
Total Cases:
Estimates suggest that the total number of TB cases in India has increased from
2.2 million to 2.6 million in recent years,
reflecting ongoing challenges in detection and treatment.
What were the problems with previous Extended Treatment Regimen?
Lengthy and Complex
: Traditional TB treatment regimens are long and require patients to
take 13 to 14 tablets daily for 9 to 11 months, or 4 to 5 tablets daily for 18 to 24 months.
Severe Side Effects
: These regimens are
physically and psychologically draining,
causing side effects
like loss of hearing and psychosis
Economic Impact
: Prolonged treatment leads to
loss of employment and drives many families into poverty
due to the need for frequent clinic visits.
WHO-Recommended Effective Regimen:
BPaL/M Regimen
: WHO has recommended a
shorter, safer, and more effective regimen
called
for drug-resistant TB patients.
Advantages
: This regimen requires only 3 to 4 tablets daily for six months, with fewer side effects and higher
success rates (89% compared to 68% for traditional treatments).
Close to
80 countries
have procured the BPaL/M regimen, and
20 high-burden countries
are already rolling it out.
Present TB Elimination Policy in India:
The deficiency in the NTP was identified in 1963 and the Revised National TB Control Programme was developed.
Presently,
India’s National TB Elimination Programme 2023
is leading the effort to meet the goal of eliminating TB by 2025, five years ahead of the
SDGs
Ending the TB epidemic by 2030
is among the health targets of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.
How India can make the best use of new treatments?
Proactive Screening and Diagnosis
: Focus on modernizing
health datasets,
GIS mapping
, and conducting targeted
multi-disease screening drives
, especially
in vulnerable populations
(e.g., those with comorbidities, slum dwellers, and prisoners).
Advanced Diagnostic Tools
: Expand the use of
portable X-ray machines with AI-driven tools
apid molecular tests
for faster and more
accurate detection and drug resistance profiling.
Early Detection and Treatment
: Leveraging new technologies and proactive measures will help
improve TB detection rates, reduce delays,
enhance treatment outcomes,
ultimately aiding in the elimination of TB in India.
Conclusion:
India need to invest in advanced diagnostic tools like AI-driven portable X-ray machines and rapid molecular tests to ensure early and accurate detection of TB, particularly in high-risk and underserved populations, to support timely treatment and reduce TB incidence.
Mains PYQ:
Can overuse and free availability of antibiotics without Doctor’s prescription, be contributors to the emergence of drug-resistant diseases in India? What are the available mechanisms for monitoring and control? Critically discuss the various issues involved.

**********How Canada’s policy of ‘reducing low-wage, temporary workers’ may impact Indians?       
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
“Temporary Workers” in Canada;
Mains level:
Canada’s Policy of “Reducing” Such Workers' Impact on Indians;
Why in the News?
On Monday, August 26, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau announced that Canada would be “
reducing the number of temporary foreign workers in low-wage jobs.”
Who are these “Temporary Workers” in Canada?
Temporary workers in Canada encompass various categories of individuals, including:
Temporary Work Visa Holders:
These individuals come to Canada for a
fixed duration
, typically
two years, to work in low-wage jobs
that pay between
CAD 13-19 per hour (approximately Rs 800-1,200 per hour).
International Students:
After completing their studies, many international students remain in Canada on
work visas for one to three years while applying for Permanent Residency (PR).
Spouse Open Work Permit Holders:
Many international students bring their
spouses to Canada, who can work in low-wage jobs under this permit.
Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) Workers:
These workers are
hired under LMIA contracts, which allow employers to recruit foreign workers
when they cannot find Canadians to fill job openings.
Humanitarian Arrivals and Youth Program Participants:
This category includes individuals arriving through
special humanitarian pathways, such as the Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET), asylum seekers,
and participants in reciprocal youth programs that allow Canadians to work abroad.
How will Canada’s Policy of “Reducing” Such Workers Impact Indians?
Reduced Opportunities:
The restrictions on
temporary workers will limit job opportunities for many Indians,
particularly
students and their spouses,
who make up a significant portion of the temporary workforce.
Impact on International Students:
Indians constitute around
40% of Canada’s international student population,
with a majority coming from Punjab. The new policy may
restrict their ability to transition from temporary work to permanent residency
Shift in Immigration Dynamics:
The introduction of restrictions emphasizes a
policy shift that could deter potential migrants from considering Canada as a destination.
Indians in Canada:
The Indian community in Canada has grown significantly in recent years. Between 2000 and 2020, the registered Indian population increased from
670,000 to over 1 million.
As of 2021, there were approximately 1.8 million people of Indian origin in Canada, representing over
5% of the total population.
Indian students are the
largest international student group
in Canada, accounting for
20% of all international students in 2021.
There were over 319,000 Indian students enrolled in Canadian institutions, contributing approximately
US$ 4.9 billion to the Canadian economy in 2021
Many highly skilled Indian professionals contribute to various sectors, including technology, healthcare, and engineering. In
2022, over 15,000 Indian tech workers
moved to Canada, enhancing the
labor market with their expertise.
Way forward:
Strengthen Domestic Opportunities
: India should focus on
creating more job opportunities and enhancing skill development programs
within the country to reduce dependency on foreign employment, ensuring that young professionals and students have viable career options at home.
Bilateral Engagement and Negotiation
: Engage in
diplomatic discussions with Canada to advocate for the interests of Indian workers and students
, seeking to ensure continued access to work and study opportunities under fair and equitable conditions.
