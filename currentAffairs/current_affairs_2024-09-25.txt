India at the UN Futures Summit: An Advocate for Peace, Global South
Context
India's civilisational ethos of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam
, meaning the world is one family,
has been pivotal in its diplomatic endeavours, especially during its G20 presidency.
The
recent UN Summit on the Future
, held on September 23, 2024,
saw the adoption of many pacts, all of which align with this vision.
Amid these developments,
it is crucial to explore the implications of these initiatives and the challenges faced by the international community
in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs).
India's Vision and Participation
At the summit, PM Modi,
representing a significant portion of humanity,
emphasised a human-centric approach to development.
He also
underscored India's achievements in SDGs, Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), and solar energy.
His
advocacy for global collaboration resonates with the realities of modern challenges
, including terrorism, cyber threats, and climate change.
PM Modi's assertion
that
global action must match global ambition reflects a call for a proactive and cohesive international response
to these issues.
The Outcome of the UN Summit on the Future
A Greater Need for Global Solidarity
The outcomes of the summit
represent a critical juncture for multilateralism
with the Pact for the Future (PFF) outlining 58 actionable measures aimed at enhancing global public goods
, including conflict prevention, climate action, and humanitarian response.
Despite these intentions,
a prevailing solidarity deficit hampers progress, leading to the emergence of unilateral and transactional approaches
to international relations.
summit was described as a once-in-a-generation opportunity
to rebuild trust and update outdated frameworks to better reflect the contemporary world.
focus on equity and solidarity is paramount
, yet scepticism remains about the operationalisation of the commitments made.
Critics point out that while there is a strong emphasis on ambition,
the mechanisms for enforcing these commitments remain vague.
The Global Digital Compact: Advancing the Digital Future
Global Digital Compact stands out as a significant achievement,
reinforcing India's commitment to bridging the digital divide and fostering an inclusive digital economy.
Proposals for an
Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and a
Global Dialogue on AI Governance
signal a
recognition of the transformative potential
of technology in achieving SDGs.
A Detailed Analysis of Challenges to Multilateralism Highlighted at the Summit
Geopolitical Tensions
Current global tensions are often framed within the context of a multipolar world,
where power dynamics are shifting.
Key flashpoints, such as the NATO-Ukraine conflict
the West-China rivalry,
and the crisis in Gaza,
illustrate the deepening divisions in international relations.
These conflicts not only worsen regional instabilities but also hinder cooperative efforts to address shared global challenges.
The struggle for influence between the West and China complicates international negotiations,
as nations align with different blocs, reducing the capacity for unified action.
Ineffectiveness in Conflict Resolution
The UN,
which was established to maintain international peace and security,
has often been criticised for its inability to prevent or resolve conflicts.
organisation's structural limitations,
combined with the political agendas of powerful member states,
have rendered it ineffective in mediating crises.
For example,
in the cases of Syria and Yemen,
despite widespread humanitarian suffering,
the UN's efforts to broker peace have yielded limited results.
The Rise of Unilateralism and Transactional Approach
In response to perceived failures in multilateral diplomacy,
countries are increasingly resorting to unilateral or transactional approaches to foreign policy.
This
trend undermines the principles of collective action
and solidarity that underpin multilateralism.
proliferation of bilateral and plurilateral agreements allows powerful nations to bypass multilateral institutions,
often prioritising their interests over global cooperation.
For instance,
trade agreements that exclude certain countries or regions can make worse inequalities
and deepen divisions.
Challenges of Global Governance Reforms
necessity for reforming multilateral institutions has been widely recognised;
however, actual progress remains elusive.
UN Security Council (UNSC) reform, which aims to enhance representation and accountability, has been stalled for decades
due to the divergent interests of its permanent members and the fear of losing influence.
While there is consensus on the need for reform
—especially to include greater representation for developing countries—
the lack of a clear path forward has led to frustration.
As the global landscape evolves,
the inability to adapt existing frameworks to contemporary realities further erodes confidence in multilateral institutions.
The Role of India in Promoting Peace and Security
Commitment to Collective Security
India has
consistently advocated for a framework of collective security,
which acknowledges that peace and security are shared responsibilities among nations.
commitment is rooted in India's post-colonial ethos
and its aspiration to emerge as a leader in the Global South.
By
championing multilateralism, India emphasises dialogue and cooperation over conflict
and unilateralism.
India has actively participated in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the United Nations,
deploying troops to various conflict zones around the world.
Promoting Regional Stability
geopolitical position in South Asia places it at the centre of regional stability efforts.
country has worked tirelessly to address conflicts and tensions
within its neighbourhood, including its relations with Pakistan and China.
Through dialogue and diplomatic engagement, India seeks to promote peace in these areas,
recognising that regional stability is crucial for global security.
prioritising diplomacy and economic integration, India aspires to mitigate tensions
and build a more stable regional environment.
Combating Terrorism
India's stance on combating terrorism is central to its approach to international security.
country has been a victim of terrorism for decades
, which has shaped its understanding of the urgency required to address this global menace.
At the UN Summit on the Future, India reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing a future free from terrorism
and highlighted the necessity of revitalising international conventions against terrorist activities.
India's advocacy for a comprehensive international legal framework to combat terrorism underscores its commitment to addressing the root causes of extremism
and fostering global cooperation in intelligence sharing and counter-terrorism efforts.
Diplomatic Engagement and Global Governance
India's role in promoting peace and security
is further exemplified by its active engagement in international forums and organizations.
As a member of the G20 and BRICS,
India leverages these platforms to advocate for peace, stability, and inclusive growth.
Its
recent G20 presidency provided an opportunity for India to emphasise the importance of global governance reforms
that reflect contemporary realities, including the need for greater representation of developing countries in decision-making processes.
Leadership in Climate Security
India's proactive stance on climate action
, exemplified by its leadership in the International Solar Alliance and its commitment to the Paris Agreement,
reflects its understanding of the interlinkages between environmental sustainability and global security.
By advocating for climate justice
and sustainable development,
India positions itself as a leader in addressing the security implications of climate change.
The recognition that environmental degradation can lead to resource scarcity and conflict is central to India’s approach to security, making it an integral part of its global peace agenda.
Conclusion
The UN Summit on the Future has provided a framework for collective action
towards a more equitable and sustainable global order.
While the aspirations outlined in the outcome document represent steps towards this goal,
realising these ambitions will
require concerted efforts from nations to transcend narrow national interests.
Sanskrit adage, Yad Bhavam, Tad Bhavati; you become what you believe serves as a guiding principle for this collective endeavour.

Editorial Analysis
**********Government Survey Reveals Unchanged Unemployment Rate Despite Sectoral Shifts
Why in news?
The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) for July 2023 to June 2024, released in September 2024, shows no significant change in the unemployment rate. There is a slight increase in the share of workers in agriculture, while the manufacturing sector shows no growth in job creation.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Unemployment (Meaning, Types, etc.)
Measuring Unemployment (Methods, NSSO, CMIE, Challenges, Govt. Initiatives, etc.)
News Summary
What is Unemployment?
Unemployment occurs when individuals who are capable of working, actively seeking work, and willing to work at prevailing wages are unable to find jobs.
It is an important indicator of the economic health of a country, reflecting the level of economic activity, productivity, and social well-being.
Types of Unemployment:
Cyclical Unemployment
: This occurs due to the ups and downs of the economy. During economic downturns, demand for goods and services decreases, leading to job losses.
Structural Unemployment
: This happens when there is a mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the needs of the industry. Technological changes often lead to structural unemployment.
Frictional Unemployment
: This type is temporary and occurs when individuals are transitioning between jobs, entering the workforce for the first time, or re-entering the workforce.
Seasonal Unemployment
: Certain industries, like agriculture or tourism, experience fluctuations in employment due to seasonal variations in demand.
Disguised Unemployment
: This occurs when more people are working than actually needed, especially in agriculture, where productivity remains low despite a high number of workers.
Measuring Unemployment in India:
Government of India employs various methods and surveys to measure unemployment.
Key agencies responsible for unemployment data collection and analysis include the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), and the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).
National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) Surveys:
The NSSO uses two primary measures to classify the working status of individuals:
Usual Principal and Subsidiary Status (UPSS)
The UPSS classifies an individual's principal status-whether employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force-based on the activity they spent the most time on in the previous year.
An individual who works in a subsidiary role for at least 30 days within the year is also counted as employed under this measure.
For example, someone unemployed for five months but working for seven months would be classified as employed, whereas someone unemployed for nine months but working for three months would still be counted as employed according to UPSS.
Current Weekly Status (CWS)
The CWS method adopts a shorter reference period of one week.
An individual is counted as employed if they worked for at least one hour on any day during the seven days preceding the survey date.
As a result, unemployment rates under CWS are typically higher than those measured by UPSS, as the probability of finding work over a week is lower compared to an entire year.
Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE):
The CMIE is an independent private limited entity that serves both as an economic think-tank as well as a business information company.
CMIE provides high-frequency data on unemployment through its
Consumer Pyramids Household Survey
(CPHS).
This data is updated regularly and offers insights into unemployment trends on a monthly basis.
Key Unemployment Indicators Used in India:
Unemployment Rate (UR)
: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment.
Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR)
: The percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively seeking employment.
Worker Population Ratio (WPR)
: The proportion of the working-age population that is employed.
Challenges in Measuring Unemployment in India:
Informal Sector Dominance
: A large portion of India’s workforce is employed in the informal sector, making it difficult to capture accurate employment data.
Underemployment and Disguised Unemployment
: Many employed individuals work below their skill levels or in low-productivity jobs, masking the true extent of unemployment.
Data Frequency and Timeliness
: There is often a lag in data collection and reporting, making it challenging to get a real-time picture of unemployment.
Government Survey Reveals Unchanged Unemployment Rate Despite Sectoral Shifts:
The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) for July 2023 to June 2024, released by the Labour Bureau, shows that the
unemployment rate in India remains stagnant, with no significant improvement in job creation, particularly in the manufacturing sector
Although there is a slight increase in the workforce distribution in agriculture, the manufacturing sector continues to struggle with employment growth.
Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) has increased, rising from 50.7% in 2017-18 to 63.7% in rural areas and from 47.6% to 52.0% in urban areas
Female participation has notably improved
, with the LFPR for women rising from 23.3% in 2017-18 to 41.7% in 2023-24.
However, experts highlight that the increase in employment is mainly due to unpaid family labor in agriculture, which has grown for the fourth consecutive year.
Despite the rise in participation, the unemployment rate remains concerning.
In rural areas, it decreased from 5.3% in 2017-18 to 2.5%, while in urban areas, it fell from 7.7% to 5.1%. The overall unemployment rate is stable at 3.2%, similar to last year.
Experts warn that the employment scenario remains grim, with a lack of job growth in key sectors like manufacturing, which has not shown significant recovery over the past decade.

**********Karnataka CM to Face MUDA Scam Probe
Why in News?
In a big setback to CM Siddaramaiah, Karnataka HC dismissed his petition challenging the sanction given by Governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot to investigate him in the MUDA scam case.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background of the Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) Scam Case
What did the Karnataka HC Decide?
Effect of the HC’s Order on Karnataka Politics
Background of the Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) Scam Case:
It started when three
anti-corruption activists approached the governor
for sanction to file complaints against the Karnataka CM.
They alleged that his wife received 14 housing sites from MUDA in exchange for a 3.16-acre plot of land that MUDA illegally acquired in 2021 during the previous BJP-led government’s tenure.
This allegedly resulted in a Rs. 55.80 crore loss for the state.
Karnataka Governor issued a show cause notice to the CM and sanctioned the proceedings against him under
the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) 1988 and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023
The CM challenged this sanction
(on the ground that the Governor of a state is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers) and the Karnataka HC placed an embargo on the trial against him.
Issue before the court - To examine Section 17A of the PCA
It specifically deals with the procedure when the police seek sanction to conduct an inquiry.
This led to the question of whether sanction for prosecution can be given when a private person is a complainant.
Ruling of the court:
The PCA does not require only a police officer to seek approval to investigate a public official. In fact, it is the
duty of a complainant to seek such approval
even if they are a private citizen.
After seeing the facts of the case,
investigation
into the alleged MUDA scam case and its beneficiary (the Karnataka CM’s family),
is certainly necessary.
Hence, the governor's order nowhere suffers from want of application of mind and the alleged haste does not invalidate the order.
Impact of the ruling:
The order essentially allows the three RTI activists to approach an anti-corruption agency such as the Karnataka Lokayukta police
to seek a probe into the MUDA scam case.
Effect of the HC’s Order on Karnataka Politics:
Options before the CM:
Siddaramaiah, considered one of the top Backward Class leaders in Karnataka, is
expected to be allowed to wage a legal battle
The Congress party
can take a high ethical stand
that the CM cannot continue if an FIR is registered against him.
In 2010
, the then Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan was asked to step down by the party on moral grounds over allegations that three of his relatives were beneficiaries of flat allotments in the Adarsh housing scam.
Political narrative favours the CM:
He is expected to benefit from the current political narrative
which portrays agencies and institutions as being exploited to take revenge on adversaries or force them to join the BJP.
The Congress has projected the case as being part of a conspiracy by the principal Opposition party (BJP)
to dislodge non-BJP CMs
across the country by various means.

**********Tripura CM declares state insurgency-free
Why in news?
Tripura Chief Minister Manik Saha has declared the state as “insurgency-free” after 584 militants had laid down their weapons before him at a surrender ceremony. The rebels were from the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and the All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF).
This development came after the Centre and the Tripura government had signed a Memorandum of Settlement with insurgent groups on September 4 in the presence of Union Home Minister.
As per the CM of Tripura, the current government’s efforts have resulted in 12 peace accords over the past decade, involving over 10,000 insurgents laying down arms.
What’s in today’s article?
Insurgency in Tripura
Background
Tribal Composition
: Tripura has 19 indigenous tribes, including the Tripra, Reang, Jamatia, Kaipeng, Naotia, Koloi, Halam, Hrangkhal, Mog, and Bangcher.
Languages
: Kok Borok is the lingua franca, along with other Tibeto-Burmese dialects.
Journey towards Statehood
Tripura was a princely state that acceded to the Indian Union on October 15, 1949.
It became a Union Territory on November 1, 1956 and a full-fledged State on January 21, 1972.
Causes of Insurgency
Demographic Shift
: The massive influx of Bengali refugees from East Pakistan led to the indigenous population decreasing from 95% in 1931 to 31% by 1991.
Discontent Among Tribals
: Tribals became a minority, losing control over land, trade, government jobs, and business, sparking grievances.
Other factors
: Tripura, like other North-Eastern states, experienced insurgency due to geographical isolation, socio-economic backwardness, dysfunctional governance, rampant corruption, and tribal land alienation.
Political Movements and Armed Insurgency
Formation of TUJS (1967)
: Tribes formed Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti (TUJS) to demand an autonomous district council under the Sixth Schedule, official status for Kok Borok, and restoration of tribal lands.
Armed Struggle
: By 1970, Tripura Sena was formed, followed by the Tripura National Volunteers (TNV) in 1978 under Bijoy Hrangkhawl, demanding an independent tribal Tripura state.
Prominent groups involved in insurgency
Insurgency in Tripura began with the formation of
in 1971, followed by
in 1981, and the more aggressive
in 1989, and
in 1990.
Rise of Communal Clashes and Militancy
Bengali Opposition and Amra Bangali
: The Bengali population opposed the tribal demands, forming the militant organization Amra Bangali. Violent clashes ensued, leading to over 1,800 deaths and 3,600 homes being destroyed.
Army Intervention (1980):
The Army was brought in to control the violence.
Decline of TNV and Peace Efforts
Links with MNF
: TNV had ties with the Mizo National Front (MNF), but after the Mizo Accord of 1986, TNV’s strength weakened.
TNV Settlement (1988):
TNV signed a peace agreement with the State government, agreeing to lay down arms. The agreement focused on restoring alienated tribal lands.
Resurgence of Militancy
Implementation Issues
: There were complaints about the non-implementation of the 1988 agreement, leading to the emergence of new militant groups and a resurgence of militancy in Tripura.
Insurgency gained momentum between 1996 and 2004, fueled by logistical support from
Bangladesh
and external intelligence networks.
The insurgents capitalized on the rough terrain and porous borders, utilizing safe havens in Bangladesh for operations, weapons, and financial support.
Strategic Response to Insurgency
Counter-insurgency operations
The approach involved
counter-insurgency operations (C.I. Ops)
that were swift and focused on area domination, without involving the Army.
Central paramilitary and State police forces, including
Special Police Officers
(tribals included), were key players.
Psychological operations
These operations were launched to correct the negative perception of the state among tribals.
This included highlighting the hypocritical behavior of insurgents and their exploitation of the tribal population.
Confidence-Building Measures
Confidence-building exercises and rehabilitation packages were provided for insurgents.
The Governor and Chief Minister publicly urged insurgents to return to the mainstream, leading to several surrenders.
Civic and Developmental Interventions
Developmental initiatives
were swiftly rolled out, including healthcare, rural connectivity, drinking water, and job generation.
Security forces also conducted
civic action programs
, providing medical aid, educational materials, and vocational training, presenting a pro-citizen, development-oriented image of the state.
Political and Governance Reforms
Peace marches
were organized in insurgency-affected areas to instill confidence in the people.
Local governance institutions
like autonomous development councils, gram panchayats, and village councils were strengthened
, ensuring tribal participation in the development process.
Conclusion
Tripura overcame insurgency through a
well-crafted, multi-dimensional strategy
, combining socio-economic development, psychological operations, humane counter-insurgency efforts, and strong political leadership.
The state’s experience demonstrated that insurgency could be tackled with
sincerity, credible leadership, and a balanced approach
that addresses both military and socio-economic needs.

**********India to launch its first mission to Venus in 2028
Why in news?
Recently, the Union Cabinet had approved India's first mission to Venus, which ISRO plans to launch in March 2028. This will be India's second interplanetary mission, following the 2013 Mars Orbiter Mission.
The Venus mission aims to study the planet's surface, sub-surface, atmosphere, and ionosphere from orbit, and will also investigate Venus's interaction with the Sun. The mission will carry scientific instruments from India and other countries for this exploration.
What’s in today’s article?
Venus Orbiter Mission (VOM)
Why is India Exploring Venus?
Venus missions launched by other countries
About
India's first planned mission to Venus,
"Shukrayaan-1,"
will study the planet's atmosphere, surface, and geological features using advanced scientific instruments.
The mission will place an orbiter around Venus to gather data on its climate, atmospheric composition, and potential volcanic or seismic activity.
Instruments like synthetic aperture radar, infrared and ultraviolet cameras, and sensors will examine Venus's ionosphere and the thick clouds of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid.
The mission aims to explore signs of active volcanoes and provide insights into the planet's unique environment.
Objectives
Investigate surface processes and subsurface stratigraphy
Study the structure, composition, and dynamics of Venus's atmosphere
Explore solar wind interactions with the Venusian ionosphere
Key highlights of the mission
Timeline
India's Venus mission, originally planned for 2023, is now scheduled for launch in March 2028.
Earth and Venus come closest every 19 months, making this timeline crucial.
Payloads
The mission will carry around 100 kg of scientific payloads and follow a similar approach to India's previous space missions.
The payloads will conduct experiments to study the flow of interplanetary dust particles, and an experiment to study the high-energy particles entering the Venusian atmosphere leading to its ionisation.
Another payload will study the composition, structure, variability, and thermal state of Venus’s atmosphere.
The satellite will gain speed in Earth's orbit, sling-shot towards Venus, and reach its orbit in about 140 days.
India's first attempt at aero-braking
This mission will also mark India's first attempt at aero-braking, a technique to slow the spacecraft using atmospheric drag.
India's Venus mission will initially place the satellite in a highly elliptical orbit of 500 km x 60,000 km around Venus to save fuel.
However, this orbit is too high for scientific experiments, so the satellite will be lowered to a more suitable orbit of either 300 x 300 km or 200 x 600 km using aero-braking.
During this process, the satellite will repeatedly skim the outer layer of Venus's atmosphere at around 140 km, creating drag to gradually reduce its orbit height.
This process, which takes about six months, requires precise control—too deep a plunge risks burning up the satellite, while too shallow prolongs orbit adjustment.
Once the desired orbit is achieved, the satellite will exit Venus's atmosphere to avoid using excess fuel to maintain its orbit.
Unique opportunity to understand Earth’s evolution
Venus is often called Earth's twin due to its similar mass, density, and size, making it an important subject for studying Earth's evolution.
Scientists believe Venus once had water but is now dry and dusty.
Clues about climate change, atmospheric dynamics
The surface temperature of is around 462°C, hotter than Mercury, due to a runaway greenhouse effect.
Water on Venus likely evaporated, creating more heat and worsening the effect.
Venus, once believed to have oceans, has now become a sweltering greenhouse world with surface temperatures reaching 470°C.
By comparing Venus’s climate with Earth’s, scientists hope to uncover clues about climate change, atmospheric dynamics, and planetary evolution.
Studying Venus can provide insights into Earth's potential future and the factors that make a planet habitable.
Technology development capabilities and scientific prowess
Venus is notoriously difficult to study due to its extreme temperatures and dense atmosphere.
On Earth, the atmospheric pressure is 1 bar, but on Venus, it's a staggering 100 bar.
Its atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with sulfuric acid clouds, and it rotates very slowly, with one Venusian day lasting 243 Earth days.
Its surface temperature is around 462°C, hotter than Mercury.
No lander has survived the extreme heat for more than a few hours.
Successful exploration would place India among an elite group of countries with advanced planetary science programs.
Various missions
There have been several missions to Venus in the past by the United States, the erstwhile USSR, Japan, and a collaborative mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) with Japan.
Recently, several space agencies have announced Venus missions:
NASA's
DaVinci
in 2029 and
Veritas
in 2031
ESA's
EnVision mission
(planned for early 2030s)
Russia's
Venera-D mission
(under development)
Why the Renewed Race to Venus?
There is renewed global interest in Venus due to its importance in understanding planetary evolution, climate change, and the potential for life in extreme conditions.
NASA, the ESA, and Russia have announced Venus missions, especially after the
2020 discovery of phosphine gas
, a potential biomarker, in Venus's atmosphere, sparking speculation about microbial life.
Venus's proximity and its value as a comparative study to Earth make it a key target for space exploration.
Beyond science, the race to Venus fosters international collaboration and highlights space capabilities, with India’s planned mission advancing its global space ambitions alongside the U.S., Russia, and China.

**********What are retractions and why do they matter?
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to retraction;
Why in the News?
The ‘Retraction Watch’ database reports an Indian scientist in Lucknow with 45 retractions, while a Kolkata researcher, who published 300 papers in a year, had six papers retracted.
What is
retraction?
A
is when a scientific journal officially takes back a research paper because it contains serious mistakes or was found to be dishonest (like using fake data).
It’s like saying, “This paper shouldn’t be trusted,” to make sure other scientists don’t rely on wrong information.
What is retraction index?
is a way to measure how often papers are retracted in a particular journal.
It helps to see the rate of retractions compared to the total number of papers published by the journal.
How It’s Calculated:
It is calculated by multiplying the number of retractions by 1,000 and dividing it by the total number of papers published in that journal during a specific time period.
What are the primary reasons for retraction?
Plagiarism
: Copying or presenting someone else’s work without proper attribution.
Fabrication/Falsification
: Deliberate manipulation of data, experiments, or results to present false findings.
Image Manipulation
: Altering figures or graphical representations, especially in fields like biology and medicine.
Paper Mills
: Fake or low-quality papers produced by organizations and sold to researchers to inflate publication counts.
Ethical Violations
: Including authorship disputes, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and failure to obtain proper consent for studies.
Errors in Data
: Honest mistakes in data collection, interpretation, or analysis that render the findings invalid.
How do retractions affect the credibility of scientific research?
Erosion of Trust
: Scientific integrity relies on trust; retracted papers can cause scientists to lose confidence in published research.
Hindrance to Scientific Progress
: Retractions delay progress, as future research may be based on faulty or retracted studies.
Impact on the Reputation of Researchers and Institutions
: Scientists and institutions involved in retractions often face damage to their credibility and career prospects.
High-Impact Journals at Greater Risk
: More retractions occur in high-impact journals, suggesting a vulnerability due to the pressure to publish groundbreaking work quickly.
Harm to Public Perception
: High-profile retractions, especially in fields like medicine, can damage public trust in science and scientific institutions.
What is the process of retracting a paper?
Detection
: Retractions are often initiated when errors or misconduct are identified through peer reviews, investigations, or by other researchers who question the validity of the work.
Investigation
: The journal and, in some cases, the author’s institution will conduct an inquiry to determine whether the issues warrant retraction.
Notification
: Once a decision is made, the journal issues a notice of retraction. This document typically explains why the paper is being retracted (e.g., misconduct or error).
Publication of Retraction Notice
: The retraction notice is published in the journal, often linked to the original paper. The original article is marked as retracted but remains in the journal archives for transparency.
Database Update
: Retractions are indexed in databases like PubMed, Retraction Watch, and others, so researchers are informed of flawed studies.
Way forward:
Strengthen Peer Review and Use AI Tools
: Implement advanced AI tools to detect plagiarism, data manipulation, and image alteration during the peer review process to prevent flawed papers from being published.
Shift Focus from Quantity to Quality
: Encourage institutions to prioritize the quality of research over the sheer number of publications to reduce the pressure on researchers and discourage reliance on paper mills.
**********Navigating cross-border insolvency
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Cross-border insolvency cases;
Why in the News?
It is essential to incorporate the significance of insolvency laws into global trade discussions through both multilateral and bilateral channels.
What are the key challenges in managing cross-border insolvency cases?
Jurisdictional Conflicts
: Difficulty in determining which country’s courts have jurisdiction over insolvency proceedings, especially when a company has assets and creditors in multiple countries.
Recognition of Foreign Proceedings
: Some countries may not recognize foreign insolvency proceedings, leading to inconsistent outcomes.
Coordination Issues
: Lack of cooperation between courts and administrators in different countries can complicate the resolution of cross-border insolvency cases.
Legal and Cultural Differences
: Variations in legal systems, insolvency laws, and business practices across countries make harmonization challenging.
Enforcement of Judgments
: Difficulty in enforcing insolvency-related judgments or agreements across different jurisdictions.
How does the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) address cross-border insolvency in India?
Limited Provisions
: The IBC, 2016, has provisions for handling cross-border insolvency on a case-by-case basis through bilateral agreements, but it lacks a comprehensive framework.
Bilateral Arrangements
: India’s approach currently relies on ad hoc bilateral agreements to manage cross-border insolvency cases, making the process fragmented and less efficient.
No Adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law
: Despite several recommendations by committees, India has yet to adopt the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, which would provide a more standardized and efficient resolution mechanism.
What international frameworks exist to facilitate cross-border insolvency resolutions?
UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (1997)
: A widely recognized framework designed to facilitate cooperation between courts and administrators in different countries.
It operates on four pillars:
access, recognition, cooperation,
coordination
. It has been adopted by over
60 countries.
EU Insolvency Regulation
: Provides a framework for handling insolvency within EU member states, facilitating the recognition of insolvency proceedings across borders within the EU.
NAFTA/US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
: Includes provisions for resolving insolvencies with cross-border implications between member countries.
Bilateral and Multilateral Trade Agreements
: Some international agreements include limited provisions on cross-border insolvency, though most focus on general trade and dispute resolution, leaving a gap in addressing insolvency directly.
Way forward:
Adopt the UNCITRAL Model Law
: India should expedite the adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency to establish a standardized framework, improving cooperation, recognition, and legal certainty in international insolvency cases.
Integrate Cross-Border Insolvency in Trade Agreements
: India should incorporate cross-border insolvency provisions in Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPAs) to ensure seamless insolvency resolution in international trade.

: In July 2023, anti-corruption activists approached Karnataka Governor Thawarchand Gehlot, alleging that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s wife, Parvathi, received 14 housing sites from the
Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA).
This was allegedly in exchange for a 3.16-acre plot of land that MUDA
illegally acquired in 2021,
during the tenure of the BJP-led government. The scam allegedly caused a loss of ₹55.80 crore to the state.
Governor’s Action
: In response, the Governor issued a show-cause notice to Siddaramaiah and later sanctioned an investigation under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PCA)
and the
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.
What were the grounds for Siddaramaiah’s challenge?
Council of Ministers’ Advice:
The Chief Minister argued that the Governor was bound by the Council of Ministers’ August 1, 2023 resolution, advising withdrawal of the show-cause notice.
Governor’s Discretion:
Siddaramaiah contended that the Governor’s sanction was unjustified, biased, and exceeded his discretionary powers, which could only be invoked if the Council’s decision was irrational.
What did the court decide?
The Karnataka High Court
upheld the Governor’s sanction
for the investigation, stating that the circumstances justified the Governor’s actions under
“exceptional circumstances.”
The court observed that the Governor’s decision was not made in haste but after
careful consideration
of the allegations and relevant facts.
The court clarified that
private individuals (complainants)
can seek approval to investigate public officials under the
and the Governor’s approval can be granted even in such cases.
The court l
ifted the interim embargo
on the investigation against Siddaramaiah, allowing the inquiry to continue into the alleged MUDA scam.
Conclusion:
The Karnataka High Court upheld Governor Gehlot’s sanction for an investigation into the alleged MUDA scam, rejecting Siddaramaiah’s challenge. The court ruled that exceptional circumstances justified the Governor’s actions, allowing the inquiry to proceed.

Chang’e-5 Mission and its outcomes
Why in the News?
Scientists long believed that
volcanic activity on the moon ceased
about a
billion years ago
.
However, a
study
China’s Chang’e-5 mission
samples
has questioned this belief with evidence suggesting the
moon had active volcanoes
recently as 120 million years ago
Chang’e-5 Mission: Overview and Recent Findings
Chang’e-5 is a mission
launched in November 2020
as part of the Chang’e lunar exploration program.
It was designed to:
Collect samples
from the moon’s surface and bring them back to Earth for analysis.
Study the geology
and mineral
composition of the moon.
It successfully landed on the
“
Mons Rumker
region”
, a volcanic complex in the
Oceanus Procellarum
(the ‘
Ocean of Storms’
) area on the moon’s near side, and
returned about 1.7 kg
of lunar material
to Earth in December 2020.
Recent Findings Based on Chang’e-5 Mission
Recent studies of samples have revealed
evidence of volcanic activity
on the moon as recently as
116-135 million years
ago.
It challenges the previous belief that the moon’s volcanic activity ceased about a billion years ago.
The
analysis of lunar glass beads
collected by Chang’e-5 has provided insights into both volcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts that shaped the moon’s surface.
What are the Beads on the Moon?
Lunar glass beads are
small, spherical or egg-shaped glass particles
found on the moon’s surface.
These beads are formed in two main ways:
Volcanic Activity:
During volcanic eruptions, molten lava fragments are thrown into the air, where they cool rapidly and form glass beads.
Impact Events:
When asteroids or meteorites hit the moon’s surface, the intense pressure and heat melt the surface material. The molten material cools quickly, forming glass beads as it lands back on the surface.
These beads are important because they:
Provide clues about the moon’s geological history.
Help scientists determine the age of volcanic eruptions.
Offer insights into the formation of the moon’s surface and its volcanic and impact events.
Key characteristics of Lunar Glass Beads
Composition:
These beads are primarily made of silicon, magnesium, and iron, with trace amounts of other elements such as potassium, titanium, and uranium.
Volcanic vs. Impact Beads:
Volcanic glass beads tend to be more uniform, while impact beads may show fractures or deformations caused by high-energy impacts. Volcanic beads often contain more volatile elements like sulphur, which are released during eruptions.
