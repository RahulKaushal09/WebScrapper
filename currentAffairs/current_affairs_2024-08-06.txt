FIVE YEARS OF ABROGATION OF ARTICLE 370
Syllabus
Mains – GS 2 & GS 3
Context:
On August 5, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the abrogation of Article 370, ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Subsequently, Parliament exercised its powers under Article 3 of the Constitution to withdraw statehood from Jammu and Kashmir, creating two Union Territories.
Background:-
“With the abrogation came security, dignity, and opportunity for women, youth, backward, tribal, and marginalized communities who were previously deprived of the benefits of development. At the same time, it has ensured that corruption, which plagued Jammu and Kashmir for decades, has been kept at bay,” Prime Minister remarked recently.
Key takeaways
Five years later, after the Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of the process, two questions loom:
Did the abrogation achieve its intended goals?
What is the way forward to bridge the democratic deficit in the Union Territory?
On the economic and governance fronts, there have been gains. Last-mile delivery of services has improved, with over 1,000 public utility services digitized.
Major projects under the Prime Minister’s development package are either completed or nearing completion, and investments worth an estimated Rs 6,000 crore have been realized.
Tourist visits to the Union Territory increased from 3.4 million in 2020 to 21.1 million in 2023, with the first half of 2024 witnessing a 20 percent increase over the previous year.
On the security front, peace has largely prevailed in the Valley, though it has been maintained more through strong-arm tactics than by winning hearts and minds.
Recently, however, the nature and focus of the conflict are shifting, with infiltrators from across the border becoming more active in the Jammu region.
Despite the detention of several elected leaders in August 2019, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have demonstrated their faith in the democratic process.
In the 2024 general election, voter turnout reached 58.6 percent— the highest in 35 years—during an incident-free poll. Nevertheless, politics remains the most significant work in progress.
Way forward
Too often, the security situation has been cited as a roadblock to restoring statehood. It is crucial to recognize that viewing democracy and security as mutually exclusive is narrow and limiting.
While restoring statehood undoubtedly requires a calibrated approach, it is a process that must commence swiftly, with clear timelines.
The Supreme Court’s September deadline to hold elections could serve as a starting point.
Only through active involvement of the people in the governance process can alienation be effectively addressed.

SUBSTANTIVE EQUALITY AND THE QUOTA QUESTION
Prelims & Mains – Polity
The Supreme Court’s recent verdict on sub-classification of the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) quota marked a milestone in equality jurisprudence. CJI D.Y. Chandrachud, emphasized substantive equality in the judgment.
In a string of rulings given over the last seven years, CJI Chandrachud has referred to substantive equality to stress that reservation is a facet of merit, and not an exception to the merit rule.
The State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh (2024) , the latest judgement allowing sub classification, stands as a testimony to the evolved understanding of judiciary with respect to reservations.
What is substantive equality
Substantive equality is a principle in law that goes beyond formal equality, which simply means treating everyone the same. Instead, substantive equality focuses on addressing the actual disparities and disadvantages that different individuals or groups face due to their unique circumstances or historical injustices.
It aims to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed by recognizing and addressing the different needs and barriers that affect them.
In essence, while formal equality treats everyone the same, substantive equality seeks to level the playing field by providing support and adjustments based on specific needs and historical contexts.
Supreme Court’s view on reservation over the years
As Limiting Equality:
Initially, the Supreme Court took a formal and restrictive approach to reservations, viewing them as exceptions to the principle of equal opportunity.
In The State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (1951), the Court ruled that reserving seats in educational institutions was unconstitutional, as there was no explicit provision for it, unlike Article 16(4) which allows reservations in public employment.
Parliament enacted the First Amendment to the Constitution, adding Article 15(4) to allow reservations in educational institutions, despite Article 29 prohibiting discrimination against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, language, or any of them with respect to admission into educational institutions.
This formalistic view persisted in the Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992) (Mandal judgment), where the Court saw Articles 15(4) and 16(4) as special provisions or in other words, an exception to the principle of equality and imposed a 50% cap on reservations.
As a Facet of Equality:
The Court’s decision in State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas (1975) marked a shift towards an expansive and substantive reading of equality, upholding a Kerala law that relaxed qualifying criteria for SC and ST candidates in government jobs, without viewing it as an exception to equality of opportunity.
As Limiting Efficiency:
Article 335 of the Constitution mandates that reservations for SCs and STs in services must be consistent with administrative efficiency.
The Supreme Court’s discourse on reservations emphasized maintaining “efficiency,” often equating merit with efficiency. This view led to rulings against reservations in promotions, as seen in the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment, where SC held that reservations in promotions would dilute efficiency in administration.
In 1995, the Constitution (Seventy-seventh) Amendment Act introduced Article 16(4A), allowing “consequential seniority,” which lets reserved-category candidates retain seniority gained through earlier promotions. This amendment was upheld in 2006, on the ground that the efficiency of administration was only relaxed, not obliterated.
Repudiation of the Reservation-Versus-Merit Binary:
Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud has reframed the quota-versus-efficiency debate through his rulings. He argues that reservations should be seen as embodying substantive equality, rather than as concessions.
Chandrachud contends that the stereotype linking reservation to inefficiency prevents SC/ST candidates from accessing promotions, which was precisely why reservations were introduced.
He views constitutional amendments as a repudiation of the binary between reservation and merit.

WESTERN GHATS
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
: Karnataka Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre recently announced the formation of a task force aimed at addressing encroachments in the Western Ghats.
<img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-196032 size-full" decoding="async" height="470" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kij.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kij.png 370w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/kij-236x300.png 236w" width="370"/>
This task force, led by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Head of Forest Force, will focus on clearing illegal resorts, homestays, and other encroachments in the ghat regions. The urgency of this action is underscored by recent landslides in Shirur, where over 10 people lost their lives.
About Western Ghats
The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri, is mountain range that stretches 1,600 km along the western coast of the Indian peninsula.
The Western Ghats traverse several Indian states: Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.
These mountains form an almost continuous chain along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, from the Tapti River to Swamithoppe in Kanyakumari district at the southern tip of India.
The range meets with the Eastern Ghats at Nilgiris before continuing south.
Anamudi is the highest peak in Western Ghats.
Features:
Biodiversity Hotspot: These mountains harbour an incredible array of plant and animal species. Over 5,000 flowering plants, 139 mammal species, 508 bird species, and countless insects call the Ghats home.
Endemic Species: Many species found here are unique to the region. For instance, the Nilgiri tahr (a mountain goat), the Malabar giant squirrel, and the lion-tailed macaque are endemic to the Western Ghats.
Rainfall Patterns: The Ghats intercept monsoon winds, leading to heavy rainfall on the windward side (western slopes) and a rain shadow effect on the leeward side (eastern slopes). This influences India’s overall climate.
Water Source: Numerous rivers originate in the Western Ghats, including the Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery. These rivers play a vital role in supporting agriculture and ecosystems downstream.
UNESCO World Heritage Site: Recognized for its ecological significance, the Western Ghats are a designated World Heritage Site, emphasizing their importance for global conservation efforts.

Ol Doinyo Lengai Volcano
: Ol Doinyo Lengai Volcano has been steadily sinking into the ground for the past 10 years, a new study shows, and the cause could be a deflating reservoir directly beneath one of the volcano’s two craters.
The research reveals that the ground around the summit of Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano, which sits along an active rift zone in East Africa, subsided at a rate of 1.4 inches (3.6 centimeters) per year between 2013 and 2023.
About Ol Doinyo Lengai Volcano :
Ol Doinyo Lengai, meaning “Mountain of God” in the Maasai language, is a unique and active stratovolcano located in the Gregory Rift, south of Lake Natron in Tanzania.
Geography and Structure
Location: Situated in the Arusha Region of Tanzania.
Elevation: The volcano rises to an elevation of approximately 2,962 meters (9,718 feet).
Crater: It has two main craters, with the northern crater being the active one.
Unique Lava:
Ol Doinyo Lengai is the only known volcano on Earth that is actively erupting carbonatite magma — extremely runny magma that is saturated with alkali elements, such as calcium and sodium, and poor in silica.
Most terrestrial magmas are rich in silica, a compound made from bonded chains of silicon and oxygen that binds molten rock together and gives it a viscous consistency.
But unlike those other magmas, whose weight is between 45 and 70% silica, the magma that feeds Ol Doinyo Lengai contains less than 25% silica by weight.
Appearance:
Although the lava is black or dark gray when it erupts, it quickly turns white once it dries.
It is because carbonatite lava weathers differently than silicate lava due to its chemical makeup.

**********Customs duty hike imposed for lab chemicals
Why in news?
The Finance Ministry has withdrawn a customs duty hike on imported laboratory chemicals, which was proposed post the Budget.
What’s in today’s article?
About laboratory chemicals
Budget 2024-25 and custom duty on laboratory chemicals
Need for imported chemicals
Imported chemicals, reagents, and enzymes are essential for experimental research across various scientific domains and the medical diagnostics industry.
These include oxidisers, corrosive acids, and compressed gases, used in experiments and product development.
Laboratory instruments like funnels, beakers, test tubes, and burners are closely associated with these chemicals.
Need for regulation
Due to their diverse properties and potential hazards, these chemicals are regulated and their imports are scrutinised. They are often niche and expensive products.
The Customs Department defines laboratory chemicals as organic or inorganic chemicals, imported in quantities not exceeding 500 grams or 500 milli-litres, identifiable by their purity and markings, intended solely for laboratory use.
India is a major manufacturer and exporter of pharmaceuticals and complex chemicals.
However, there is insufficient local demand from Indian research institutions to justify the substantial capital investments needed to produce niche chemicals.
According to scientists, replicating results from experiments conducted abroad, a crucial aspect of experimental research, often necessitates using the exact same materials.
The Budget documents released on July 23 increased the Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on imported laboratory chemicals from 10% to 150%, leading to a significant price hike.
For example, a batch of chemicals that previously cost ₹1,00,000 would now cost ₹2,50,000.
Additionally, there was a 25% hike on imported plastic components for laboratory use. Researchers were shocked by the steep increase, with some considering it a misprint.
Resolution of the issue
The customs department has raised import duties on ethanol that was previously being classified as ‘laboratory chemicals’ to avoid a 150% customs duty.
There are two main types of ethanol: regular ethanol used for alcohol production and ‘denatured’ ethanol, which is mixed with additives and used in laboratories and commercial applications.
While local manufacturers typically produce denatured alcohol, the new Finance Ministry regulations require imported laboratory chemicals to include a letter stating that they will only be used in a laboratory and not for commercial resale.
This could cause some delays in the procurement of these chemicals, although the duty rate will return to its original level.

**********Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina Quits
Why in news?
Sheikh Hasina has resigned as Bangladesh's Prime Minister amid violent protests demanding her departure. The Bangladesh Army, led by General Waker-Uz-Zaman, has taken control.
General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced that the Army will establish an interim government and urged protesters to return to peace.
What’s in today’s article?
The situation in Bangladesh
Sheikh Hasina's exit from Dhaka and its impact on India
India’s stand during the crisis
Background
Bangladesh has been facing significant protests for the past month over the job quota system.
The protestors opposed to the
return of a 30% quota in government employment at all levels for those who fought for the freedom of Bangladesh from Pakistan
, as well as their children and grandchildren.
These protests are the largest since Sheikh Hasina was re-elected for her fourth consecutive term since 2008.
While she has overseen economic growth, her crackdown on the Opposition, media, and civil society has led to widespread unpopularity.
The youth-led protests became the tipping point for her resignation.
Hasina resigned and fled to India
Hasina resigned and fled to India on a military aircraft, following weeks of anti-government protests that have left at least 300 dead and hundreds injured.
Following her resignation, Sheikh Hasina reportedly received an ultimatum to flee the country.
After leaving Dhaka, she arrived at Hindon Air Base in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad.
She held talks with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on the present situation in Bangladesh and her future course of action.
The Indian Air Force and other security agencies are providing security to Hasina.
While speculation exists that Hasina might travel to London, reports also suggest she could head to Belarus.
India has lost a trusted partner in the region
Sheikh Hasina's departure after 17 years means India has lost a trusted regional partner.
Even after her re-election for the fourth consecutive time earlier this year, Hasina's first port of call for a bilateral visit was India.
She was a friend to India, collaborating closely on countering terrorist groups in Bangladesh.
Hasina has been sensitive to India’s security concerns.
In return, India has been a generous neighbour, helping Bangladesh’s development as well as building connectivity to signal the economic and security interdependence between the two countries.
With Hasina as the PM, Bangladesh and India achieved a historic land boundary agreement on an issue festering for decades.
The countries share electricity and fuel, and India is the first responder for Bangladesh.
Strong China
A strong Chinese presence in Bangladesh poses a significant challenge for India, potentially leaving it encircled by unfriendly or indifferent neighbors:
China and Pakistan to the west and north,
a communist-led Nepal,
Taliban-controlled Afghanistan,
an anti-India Maldives, and
a potentially ambivalent Bangladesh.
This situation would be detrimental to India's strategic and security interests.
Recently, India offered to help out Bangladesh on the Teesta Reservoir Project, which China has been eyeing.
The location of the project, close to the Siliguri Corridor or the Chicken's Neck, is of strategic concern for India.
India faced security issues when Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) was in power
During the BNP rule, anti-India activities grew significantly. The BNP, led by Begum Khaleda Zia, used an anti-India stance as a major election plank.
This resonated with many Bangladeshis who felt India was interfering in their internal politics.
The BNP's anti-India rhetoric was further amplified by its alliance with Islamic groups like Jamaat-e-Islami between 2001 and 2006.
Several ethnic insurgent groups that troubled northeast India, like the Ulfa, operated from Bangladesh during this time.
The recent 'India-Out' campaign is another example of the BNP's stance, where some of its leaders openly voiced their opposition against their neighbour.
Hence, India will be worried about what attitude the new government will take towards India.
Border Security Concern
New Delhi cannot afford to have another front open when the LoC and the border with Pakistan is hot again, and the Indian Army is in a long standoff with the PLA in eastern Ladakh.
The Myanmar border is also extremely volatile, and the source of unrest and strife in India’s Northeast.
Islamist extremism could return to Bangladesh
As per various analysts, the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina represented a secular and modernizing vision of Bangla nationalism.
Her firm politics served as a strong barrier against radical extremism, which posed significant security challenges for India and threatened to push Bangladesh in a regressive direction.
Future of transit
Transit and trans-shipment arrangements with Bangladesh may be revised by the incoming regime in Dhaka.
India needs these for better logistics supply to its Northeast. New Delhi, therefore, must work with the interim govt to ensure their continuity.
Bangladesh protests - its internal matter
India described the violent protests in Bangladesh as an internal matter of that country.
India has been naturally supportive towards her
New Delhi has tacitly supported Sheikh Hasina despite her undemocratic practices.
The West has criticized her crackdown on civil society, the opposition, and the media, calling for an end to her authoritarian methods.
India's backing of Hasina, even amid allegations of election rigging, has created tensions between India and the West.
Conclusion
During the recent protests, there have been hints of anti-India anger due to the perception that India was helping Hasina cling on to power. Hence, India will have to be careful of the popular sentiments in Bangladesh.
Diplomacy will continue and whoever is in power in Bangladesh, India will do business with them. However, the comfort level might differ from when Sheikh Hasina was at the helm.

**********The Powers of the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi
Why in News?
The SC held that the authority of the LG of Delhi to nominate 10 persons/ aldermen with special knowledge of municipal administration to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is a statutory duty attached to his office.
The ruling party of the NCT of Delhi has held that the SC's claim that the Delhi LG is not bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers in this matter is a major setback to democracy.
What’s in Today’s Article?
The Office of the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi
Tussle Between the Union Govt and the Govt of NCT of Delhi
Tussle Between the LG and the Govt of NCT over the Administration of MCD
The Office of the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi:
Constitutional provisions:
Under
Article 239
of the Constitution of India, the administration of every union territory (UT) is handled by an administrator appointed by the President of India.
However,
the Constitution (69th Amendment) Act 1991
introduced
Article 239AA
which created an
elected Legislative Assembly
and a Council of Ministers (CoM) including a Chief Minister (CM) for National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT).
This
Assembly has the power to make laws for NCT
with respect to any of the matters under the
State or Concurrent Lists
of the Seventh Schedule (except public order, police and land matters).
The LG of Delhi was designated the Administrator of the NCT.
Powers of LG:
S/he acts on the aid and advice
of the CoM (including a CM), except when s/he is compelled to act in his/her
discretion
by or under any law.
If the LG and the Ministers disagree on any issue,
the LG shall refer it to the President
for decision and act accordingly.
When such a decision is pending with the President, it
shall be competent for the LG to take prompt action
in any scenario where the matter (in his/her opinion) is urgent.
Under Article 239AB
, the President may (on receipt of a report from the LG or otherwise) suspend the operation of any provision of Article 239AA by order.
This is done in a situation in which the administration of the NCT cannot be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 239AA.
Tussle Between the Union Govt/LG and the Govt of NCT of Delhi:
The relationship between
Articles 239 and 239AA
causes political conflict between the Union and the government of the NCT of Delhi for administrative control of the NCT region.
In 2018, the SC held that the
LG is bound by the aid and advice
of the CoM for all matters where the Legislative Assembly has the power to make laws.
The LG only needs to be consulted
on decisions taken by the Council,
but his/her concurrence isn’t required.
In order to overturn the SC's ruling, the central government enacted
the Government of National Capital Territory (Amendment) Act, 2021.
It prohibited
the Legislative Assembly from deliberating on issues concerning the day-to-day administration of the NCT and from conducting any investigations into administrative decisions.
It compels
the Legislative Assembly to reserve any laws enacted by the Assembly for
review by the President
if the bill 'incidentally' includes any topics outside the Assembly's authority.
Furthermore,
it requires the LG's 'opinion'
on all executive actions done by the government.
The Delhi government
challenged
the constitutional validity of the amendment in the SC
, claiming that it establishes the LG as the default administrative authority over NCT in all matters.
This destroys the
basic features of federalism, separation of powers
, rule of law and representative democracy.
In 2023, the SC upheld the Delhi government’s powers to control civil servants and day-to-day administration of the NCT of Delhi.
Tussle Between the LG and the Govt of NCT over the Administration of MCD:
The case before the SC:
The legal question before the court
was whether the LG could nominate 10 persons (to the MCD) as a part of the statutory duty of his office or was he bound by the aid and advice of the CoM.
The case was reserved for judgment by the SC in 2023.
The verdict:
The court held that the executive power of the Delhi govt would conform to a parliamentary law
dealing with subjects in the State and Concurrent Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.
The Bench held that the power of the LG (to nominate 10 persons with special knowledge of municipal administration to the MCD) is drawn from the
Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.
This parliamentary law was amended in 1993 to incorporate constitutional changes in Articles 239AA and 239AB.

**********India – Bangladesh Bilateral Relationship
Why in the News?
India’s relationship with Bangladesh may have entered a phase of uncertainty after Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned following weeks of violent demonstrations.
The Army chief has declared that an interim government will now run the country.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Political History of Bangladesh
India – Bangladesh Relationship (History, Trade, Development, Culture, etc.)
News Summary
Brief Political History of Bangladesh:
After the formation of Bangladesh in 1971, Awami League’s Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became the first Prime Minister of the country.
However, in 1975, he was assassinated during a coup.
1975-1990:
The Bangladeshi military played a significant role, starting with Chief Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem's appointment as president in 1975, followed by a military junta.
Gen Ziaur Rahman became President in 1977 but was assassinated in 1981.
His successor, Abdus Sattar, was ousted in a 1982 coup led by Army Chief H M Ershad, who later resigned in 1990 due to mass unrest.
Civilian Governments:
Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina (daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) served non-consecutive terms, with an attempted coup in 1996.
Khaleda's term ended in unrest in 2006, leading to a military-influenced caretaker government until 2008.
Post-2008 Stability:
After regaining power in 2008, Hasina ensured the army returned to barracks.
In 2010, the Supreme Court limited military interventions and reinforced secular principles in the constitution.
India – Bangladesh Bilateral Relationship:
India and Bangladesh share bonds of history, language, culture, and multitude of other commonalities.
Historical Ties:
India's relationship with Bangladesh dates back to the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War when India provided crucial military and material assistance to help Bangladesh gain independence from Pakistan.
However, the relationship deteriorated in the mid-1970s due to boundary disputes, insurgency, and water-sharing issues, especially after military regimes took control in Bangladesh.
Stability in bilateral relations was restored when Sheikh Hasina became Prime Minister in 1996, leading to the signing of the
Ganga Water Sharing Treaty
Since then, India and Bangladesh have strengthened their cooperation in various sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, connectivity, and defense.
Economic and Commercial Ties:
Bangladesh is India’s 25
largest trading partner, with the size of the bilateral trade at $12.9 billion.
The trade is dominated by exports, with Bangladesh being India’s eighth largest export partner.
In FY24,
India's exports to Bangladesh contracted 9.5 per cent to $11 billion
Bangladesh is also a key destination for Indian auto exports
, alongside African and Latin American countries.
In 2022, both countries completed a joint feasibility study on a
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
This agreement is crucial as Bangladesh will lose its Least Developed Country (LDC) status after 2026, which will impact its duty-free and quota-free access to Indian markets.
Consequently,
Bangladesh aims to finalize a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India
Power and Energy:
Bangladesh imports 1160 MW of power from India
Projects like the
Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline
are key initiatives.
India supports Bangladesh's energy sector through various partnerships.
Development Partnership:
India has extended four Lines of Credit to Bangladesh amounting to USD 8 billion for infrastructure development.
High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs) are a significant part of India’s assistance, focusing on human resource development and capacity building.
Cultural Cooperation:
Cultural exchanges are facilitated through the
Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre and Indian Cultural Centre in Dhaka
Programs in arts, dance, and language promote people-to-people contacts.
The Bangladesh Youth Delegation program attracts young talent to visit India.

the Department of Space (18.4%),
the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (12.4%), and
the Department of Atomic Energy (11.4%).
Government funding plays a crucial role, with significant allocations directed towards autonomous R&D laboratories that drive strategic research and technological development.
Public vs Private Contribution to R&D:
Private industry contributions in India lag behind many other economies.
Indian businesses contribute approximately $6.2 billion, representing 37% of the country’s Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D (GERD), compared to the global average where business enterprises typically contribute over 65%.
In leading innovative economies such as
China, Japan, South Korea, and the U.S., more than 70% of R&D funding comes from private industries
, driven by market forces and profit motives, with substantial R&D activities conducted in higher education institutions (HEIs).
Comparing India’s R&D Funding with Other Countries:
India’s R&D is witnessing significant growth, with a notable increase in Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD) from ₹6,01,968 million in 2010-11 to ₹12,73,810 million in 2020-21.
However, with research and development investment as a percentage of GDP standing at 0.64%, India falls behind major developed and emerging economies such as China (2.4%), Germany (3.1%), South Korea (4.8%) and the United States (3.5%).
Despite a lower GDP share for R&D,
India has become a significant producer of academic talent, generating 40,813 PhDs annually, ranking third after the U.S. and China
India's research output is also strong, with over 300,000 publications in 2022, placing it third globally.
In terms of patent grants, India ranks sixth worldwide with 30,490 patents in 2022, showcasing its growing innovation landscape and potential for further intellectual property development.
