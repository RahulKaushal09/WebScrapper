Green Revolution in India
Green Revolution in India:
About:
The history of the Green Revolution in India goes back to the
1960s
when high-yielding rice and wheat was introduced to
increase food production
It was a period during which
agriculture in India was converted into a modern industrial system
adoption of technology
, such as
The use of high yielding variety (HYV) seeds,
Mechanised farm tools,
Irrigation facilities,
Pesticides and fertilisers.
Mainly led by agricultural scientist
M.
S. Swaminathan
in India, this period was part of the larger Green Revolution endeavour initiated by
Norman Borlaug -
for increasing agricultural productivity in the developing world,
by leveraging agricultural research and technology.
Impact:
Crop varieties can be chosen by
breeding for a variety of beneficial traits
, including high yields, resistance to disease, fertiliser responsiveness, and product quality.
It resulted in
an increase in food grain production
(especially in Punjab, Haryana, and Western UP), reduction in imports (leading to self-sufficient), industrial development, rural employment generation, etc.
Criticism:
Despite its initial success, the Green Revolution was met with much controversy throughout India. This is mainly due to:
Increased input cost:
This resulted in the indebtedness of the small farmers due to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties.
Environmental damage and reduced soil fertility:
Due to excessive and inappropriate use of fertilisers and pesticides.
Increased regional disparities:
This is because the green revolution spread only in irrigated and high-potential rainfed areas.
Largely limited to wheat and rice.
Green Revolution in Maize:
Maize crop in India:
In India,
maize is principally grown in two seasons
, rainy (kharif) and winter (rabi).
Kharif maize represents around 83% of maize area in India, while rabi maize corresponds to 17% maize area.
Among the maize growing countries,
India ranks 4th in area and 7th in production
, representing around 4% of the world maize area and 2% of total production.
Maize production in India:
There is another less celebrated revolution that has taken place in India.
Between 1999-2000 and 2023-24, annual production of maize has more than tripled, with average per-hectare yields rising from 1.8 to 3.3 tonnes.
Another feature of maize in India:
Maize is a fuel crop rather than a feed crop.
Less than 25% of the maize produced is consumed directly by humans.
An estimated 60% goes as feed for poultry and livestock, which is indirectly consumed as food by households (as chicken, egg or milk).
14-15% of India’s maize utilisation is for industrial purposes
. Maize grains have 68-72% starch, and 1-3% of other simple carbohydrates.
Starch
has applications in the textile, paper, pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries.
The usage of maize as a feedstock for
ethanol
, which is mixed with petrol, is more recent.
New varieties of maize:
The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) has bred
India’s first “waxy” maize hybrid
with high starch content, making it better suited for ethanol production.
The Mexico-based CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) has opened
a maize doubled haploid (DH) facility
at Kunigal, Karnataka.
It produces genetically pure maize that can be used as parents for further crossing and breeding of hybrids.
What advantage does maize have over wheat and rice?
Rice and wheat are resistant to hybridization
because they are self-pollinating plants, meaning that both the male and female reproductive organs are present in their flowers.
This contrasts with maize, whose ability to cross-pollinate makes hybrid breeding a profitable endeavour.
Role of private sector in green revolution in maize:
More than 80% of India's maize crop is hybridised by the private sector.
CIMMYT is sharing its improved inbred lines with both public sector institutions and 25-odd private seed companies.

**********How do Assam's Foreigners Tribunal Function?
Background:
On July 5, the Assam government asked the Border wing of the State’s police not to forward cases of non-Muslims who entered India illegally before 2014 to the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs).
This was in keeping with the
Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019
that provides a citizenship application window for non-Muslims — Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, Jains, and Buddhists — who allegedly fled persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Foreign Tribunal (Objective, Composition, Powers, etc.)
Role of Border Police in Enforcing FT Laws
About the Recent Controversy
About Foreign Tribunal:
Foreign Tribunals (FTs) are quasi-judicial bodies established through the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order of 1964, under Section 3 of the
Foreigners’ Act of 1946
These tribunals
allow local authorities in a state to refer individuals suspected of being foreigners for further examination
Currently, FTs are exclusive to
, while other states handle cases of "illegal immigrants" according to the Foreigners’ Act.
Composition of an FT
Each FT is led by a member who is a judge, advocate, or civil servant with judicial experience.
In 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs informed Parliament that Assam has 300 FTs.
However, the State’s Home and Political Department website indicates that only 100 FTs are currently operational.
Powers of Foreign Tribunal:
Under the 1964 order, Foreign Tribunals (FTs) have similar powers to civil courts.
They can summon people, enforce attendance, examine individuals under oath, and request documents.
When a person is suspected of being a foreigner, the tribunal must serve a notice in English or the state's official language within 10 days of receiving the case.
The person then has 10 days to respond and another 10 days to present evidence supporting their claim of citizenship.
FT must resolve the case within 60 days
If the person cannot prove their citizenship, the tribunal can send them to a detention center, now called a transit camp, for eventual deportation.
Role of Assam Police Border Organisation:
The Assam Police Border Organisation was initially formed in 1962 as part of the State police’s Special Branch under the
Prevention of Infiltration of Pakistani (PIP) scheme
It became an independent wing in 1974 and is now led by the Special Director General of Police (Border).
Following Bangladesh's liberation war, the PIP scheme was renamed the
Prevention of Infiltration of Foreigners (PIF) scheme
The Central government has sanctioned 3,153 of the 4,037 personnel posts in this wing under the PIF scheme, with the remaining 884 posts sanctioned by the Assam government.
This wing is responsible for:
Detecting and deporting illegal foreigners,
Patrolling the India-Bangladesh border alongside the Border Security Force,
Maintaining a secondary line of defense to prevent illegal entry, and
Monitoring people living in riverine and sandbar areas.
Additionally, they refer individuals with questionable citizenship to FTs to determine their nationality based on documentation.
Election Commission of India can also refer cases of 'D' (doubtful) voters to an FT
People excluded from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) draft, released in August 2019, can appeal to FTs to prove their citizenship.
Approximately 19.06 lakh out of 3.3 crore applicants were excluded from the NRC, and the process is currently on hold
About the Recent Controversy:
On July 11 2024, the
Supreme Court overturned a Foreign Tribunal decision that had declared Rahim Ali, a now-deceased farmer, a foreigner 12 years ago
The court called this decision a "grave miscarriage of justice" and emphasized that the Foreigners’ Act does not give authorities the power to randomly select people and demand they prove their citizenship.
In September 2018, an FT member in Morigaon, central Assam, remarked that cases involving foreigners had become like an industry, with many people trying to make money off the situation.
The member also pointed out that notices were often placed on trees or electric poles, leaving the accused unaware of the cases against them.

**********NITI Aayog Suggests Measures to Revitalize Electronics Industry
Why in news?
NITI Aayog has released a report titled “
Electronics: Powering India’s Participation in Global Value Chains
”. Through this report, the Aayog has recommended a slew of measures to help grow India’s electronics sector from $100 billion to $500 billion by 2030.
What’s in today’s article?
Electronics sector in India
Key highlights of the report
Background
Presently, India's electronics manufacturing primarily involves the final assembly of electronic goods.
Brands and design firms have started increasingly outsourcing assembly, testing, and packaging tasks to Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies in India.
However, the ecosystem for design and component manufacturing is at a nascent stage.
Statistics
India’s electronics sector has experienced rapid growth, reaching USD 155 billion in FY23.
Production nearly doubled from
USD 48 billion in FY17 to USD 101 billion in FY23
, driven primarily by mobile phones, which now constitute 43% of total electronics production.
This comprises USD 86 billion in finished goods production and USD 15 billion in components manufacturing.
India has significantly reduced its reliance on smartphone imports, now manufacturing 99% domestically.
Global scenario
The global electronics market, valued at USD 4.3 trillion, is dominated by countries like China, Taiwan, USA, South Korea, Vietnam and Malaysia.
India currently exports approximately
USD 25 billion annually
, representing
less than 1%
of the global share despite 4% share in global demand.
Various initiatives by the govt
100% FDI is allowed under the automatic route.
In the case of defence electronics, FDI up to 49% is allowed through automatic route and beyond 49% requires government approval.
In order to position India as a global hub for ESDM, various schemes have been released. These include:
the Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing;
Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for IT Hardware;
Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS);
Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters Scheme (EMC 2.0).
Additionally, the
Semicon India Program
with an incentive outlay of $10 Bn was launched with the vision to develop a sustainable semiconductor and display ecosystem in the country.
This program will establish India as global hub for semiconductor and display manufacturing, promote self-reliance, strengthen resilience in global supply chains.
Other schemes such as – Digital India, Make In India, Phased Manufacturing Program, Electronic Cluster Manufacturing Scheme, Electronics Development Fund etc. have been launched to support the growth of this sector.
Challenges
Relatively high import tariffs
lead to higher costs of input parts, making the assembled product uncompetitive in global market.
India currently has one of the most complex tariff structures with multiple tariff slabs at 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%+, along with variety of surcharges.
Not only it increases costs of several sub-assemblies and components, it also leads to misinterpretations and disputes, thereby increasing compliance costs.
Lack of robust electronics component ecosystem
An ecosystem for high-complexity components such as SMD grade passives, semiconductors etc. does not currently exist.
Lack of access to the global demand
as it has failed to proactively attract top brands from different electronics segments to establish large-scale operations in India.
High cost of capital
due to India’s relatively high cost of financing, which ranges from 9% to 13%.
India’s tariffs are higher than China (4 per cent), Malaysia (3.5 per cent), and Mexico (2.7 per cent).
Lack of R&D and design ecosystem
Inadequate infrastructure facilities
Inadequate talent and skilling
USD 500 billion in electronics manufacturing by 2030
India should aim USD 500 billion in electronics manufacturing by 2030.
This ambitious target comprises
USD 350 billion from finished goods manufacturing and USD 150 billion from components manufacturing
The report added that such growth would create employment for about 6 million people.
Projection in a business as usual (BAU) scenario
In a BAU scenario, the report noted that the projections indicate India's electronics manufacturing could escalate to USD 278 billion by FY30.
This includes USD 253 billion from finished goods and USD 25 billion from components manufacturing.
Strategic interventions needed to achieve the goal of USD 500 billion by 2030
promoting components and capital goods manufacturing,
incentivising R&D and Design,
tariff rationalization,
skilling initiatives,
facilitation of technology transfers, and
infrastructure development to foster a robust electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India.
The report emphasised
scaling up production in established segments such as mobile phones and establishing foothold in component manufacturing
Additionally, it said there should be a strong focus on diversifying into emerging areas such as wearables, IoT devices, and automotive electronics.
To enhance competitiveness, India needs to localize high-tech components, strengthen design capabilities through R&D investments, and forge strategic partnerships with global technology leaders, the report noted.
The report also identified fiscal support to design-focussed companies alongside easing the process for technology transfer as key to boosting domestic electronics manufacturers’ role in global value chains (GVCs).
It also provides suggestions around improving access to skilled labour, by expediting visa approvals for professional visiting for training purposes and setting up Electronics Skill Training Hubs, and easing processes around technology transfer.
There is a need to develop a mechanism to fast-track approvals under Press Note 3 (2020) for specific proposals where foreign companies are critical for ecosystem development.
Press Note 3 (PN3) of 2020 was a policy amendment issued by the Government of India in April 2020 to regulate foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indian companies.
The note was intended to protect Indian companies from opportunistic takeovers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure national security.

**********Vasco da Gama’s toxic legacy is now a ‘pandemic’ that kills 8 million globally   
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Tobacoo industry in India
Mains level:
CRISPR can reduce the impact of Tobacoo
Why in the news?
On July 8th, 1497, Vasco da Gama’s historic voyage began, reshaping global maritime routes and leaving a lasting impact on trade and culture. This era of exploration introduced and disseminated tobacco, profoundly affecting societies in numerous ways.
Cultivation and Production of Tobacco
Historical Introduction:
Tobacco was originally cultivated by Native Americans and brought to Europe in the 16th century. It was introduced to South Asia by European traders and colonizers, notably the Portuguese, Dutch, and British.
Economic Significance:
Tobacco is a drought-tolerant crop providing livelihoods to many. It accounts for about 2% of India’s agricultural exports and employs over 45 million people.
Revenue Generation:
The tobacco industry is a major source of revenue through taxation and exports, generating over ₹22,000 crores annually.
Implications on Human Health
Health Issues:
Tobacco use contributes to various cancers (lung, mouth, throat, oesophagus, pancreas, and bladder), respiratory diseases (COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis), cardiovascular problems (heart disease, stroke, hypertension), and other conditions like diabetes, infertility, weakened immune system, and complications in pregnancy.
Addiction:
Nicotine, a highly addictive substance in tobacco, alters brain function leading to severe addiction.
Health Crisis:
In India, tobacco use causes over 1.2 million deaths annually. It is responsible for 27% of all cancers and adds significant costs to healthcare and productivity losses, totaling approximately ₹1.82 trillion annually.
Ethical and Revenue Considerations
Economic Benefits vs. Health Costs:
While tobacco provides economic benefits and employment, it comes with tremendous human and financial costs due to tobacco-related illnesses.
Constitutional Provisions:
Under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to life and health. The Directive Principles of State Policy mandate the state to improve public health and living standards.So,Govt. has responsibility to prevent tobacoo consumption.
Indian needs to Stack Up Its Priorities
Institutional Conflict:
The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) focuses on eliminating tobacco to mitigate health impacts, while the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) aims to increase tobacco crop yields.
Policy and Ethical Dilemma:
The conflicting priorities between ICMR and ICAR create significant policy challenges. The constitutional mandate to prioritize public health should guide policy decisions.
Will CRISPR make a difference?
Gene Editing Potential:
CRISPR technology offers potential solutions by developing genetically modified tobacco plants with reduced nicotine content.
Research Developments:
Studies have shown promise in using CRISPR to significantly lower nicotine levels in tobacco plants. However, further characterization is needed to ensure these modifications do not negatively impact other important traits.
Collaborative Efforts:
Collaboration between ICMR and ICAR is crucial to align scientific advancements with public health goals and agricultural sustainability.
The Tobacco Lobby and Surrogate Advertising
Circumventing Regulations:
The tobacco industry employs surrogate advertising to promote its products despite stringent advertising bans. These tactics perpetuate tobacco consumption, especially among youth, undermining public health efforts.
Aggressive Lobbying:
The tobacco industry has a large network of 1,027 registered lobbyists at the state level in 2024, many of whom are former government employees. They engage in extensive lobbying to weaken, delay or block life-saving tobacco control measures.
Way forward:
Implement Stricter Regulations:
Enforce stringent regulations on tobacco advertising, including surrogate advertising, and ensure compliance through regular monitoring and penalties.
Ban on Public Smoking:
Implement and strictly enforce smoking bans in public places to reduce exposure to second-hand smoke.

Mains level:
Decision-Making Process of Foreigners Tribunals
Why in the news?
On July 5, the Assam government instructed the Border wing of the State police not to refer cases of non-Muslims who entered India illegally before 2014 to the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs).
About Foreigners Tribunals:
Foreigners Tribunals are quasi-judicial bodies established to determine if a person staying illegally in India is a “foreigner” or not.
They were set up under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, enacted by the central government under the Foreigners Act, 1946.
Initially, only the central government could set up these tribunals. But a 2019 amendment empowered district magistrates in all states and UTs to establish Foreigners Tribunals.
The tribunals have the powers of a civil court to summon witnesses, require document production, and examine evidence.
Decision-Making Process of Foreigners Tribunals:
Referral:
Individuals suspected of being foreigners are referred to FTs by local authorities or border police. This referral can be based on various factors, including lack of documentation or doubtful voter status.
Notice Issuance:
Upon receiving a reference, the FT issues a notice to the person alleged to be a foreigner. This notice is served in English or the state’s official language.The person has 10 days to respond to the notice and an additional 10 days to submit evidence supporting their claim of citizenship.
Submission of Evidence:
The individual must present evidence to prove their Indian citizenship. This may include documents like birth certificates, school certificates, land records, or other official records.
Verification:
The tribunal examines the documents and evidence provided, and may call witnesses or seek additional information if necessary.
Hearing:
The FT has the authority to summon and examine the individual on oath, and to require the production of additional documents. The tribunal operates with certain powers of a civil court.
Judgment:
If the evidence provided is deemed insufficient to prove citizenship, the individual may be declared a foreigner. If evidence is adequate, the person is recognized as an Indian citizen.
Detention and Deportation:
If declared a foreigner and unable to appeal successfully, the person may be sent to a detention center (transit camp) for deportation.
Role of Border Police:
Detection and Referral:
The Assam Police Border Organisation is responsible for detecting illegal foreigners and referring suspicious cases to FTs.
Patrolling and Defence:
They patrol the India-Bangladesh border, work with the Border Security Force, and maintain a second line of defense.
Monitoring:
They monitor people settled in riverine and char (sandbar) areas.
Cases of ‘D’ Voters:
They refer cases of ‘D’ (doubtful) voters to FTs as directed by the Election Commission of India.
NRC Appeals:
People excluded from the NRC can appeal to the FTs through this wing to prove their citizenship.
Challenges and Criticisms:
Supreme Court Rulings:
The Supreme Court has overturned FT orders citing grave miscarriages of justice, such as the wrongful declaration of a deceased farmer, Rahim Ali, as a foreigner.
Corruption and Malpractice:
Observations have been made about corruption within the system, with allegations of notices being improperly served.
Conclusion:
Need to Implement stricter oversight and auditing of Foreigners Tribunals to ensure fairness and adherence to legal procedures. Regular reviews and monitoring can help prevent corruption and malpractice, ensuring that notices are properly served and tribunal processes are transparent.

Encroachment and Loss:
Approximately 10 million hectares of Indian forests are under encroachment, and about 5.7 million hectares have been lost for non-forestry purposes.
Dependence on Forests:
Nearly 27.5 crore people rely on forests for subsistence, highlighting the importance of sustainable management.
Restoration Goals:
India aims to restore 26 million hectares of degraded forests by 2030, but faces challenges such as encroachment and the need for effective tree planting strategies.
Way forward:
Community Involvement:
Need to foster local participation in tree planting drives by involving communities in planning, execution, and ongoing maintenance.
Monitoring and Maintenance:
Try to implement robust post-planting monitoring and care systems to ensure the survival and growth of planted trees.
Policy and Strategy Improvements:
To address criticism of mass planting drives, India needs to prioritize adequate financing, active community participation, and technical considerations in forestry and restoration strategies.
**********Decline in popularity of Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS)
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS); Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.
Why in the News?
Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS) are mutual fund schemes that offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.
Recently, ELSS has seen a decline in popularity, with more money being withdrawn from these schemes than invested.
What is Section 80C of the Income Tax Act?
Section 80C permits certain
investments and expenses to be tax-exempted
By well-planning the 80C investments that are spread diversely across
various options
like National Savings Certificate (NSC), Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP), Public Provident Fund (PPF), etc., an individual can claim
deductions up to Rs 1,50,000.
By taking
tax benefits under 80C
, one can avail of a reduction in tax burden.
About Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS)
An ELSS fund or an equity-linked savings scheme is the
only kind of mutual funds eligible for tax deductions
under the provisions of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Investors can claim a tax
rebate of up to Rs 1,50,000
and save up to Rs 46,800 a year in taxes by investing in ELSS mutual funds.
ELSS mutual funds’
asset allocation
is mostly
(65% of the portfolio
) made towards equity and equity-linked securities such as listed shares.
They may have some exposure to
fixed-income securities
as well.
These funds come with a
lock-in period of 3 years
only, the shortest among all Section 80C investments.
Being
market-linked
, they are
subject to market risk
, but may offer potentially
higher returns compared to traditional tax-saving instruments
like National Savings Certificate (NSC) or Public Provident Fund (PPF).
Recent Trends in ELSS
In the past few months, more money has been taken out of ELSS than put in.
For example, last month ₹445 crore was withdrawn, while in April it was ₹144 crore.
In the last fiscal year, only ₹1,041 crore was invested in ELSS, compared to ₹7,744 crore the previous year.
Impact of the New Tax Regime
new tax regime
introduced in 2020-21
, which is
now the default option
The old tax regime
offered various tax exemptions and deductions
, helping to reduce income tax.
benefits are not available under the new tax regime

OpenAI is now working on a
new reasoning technology
under the
code name “Strawberry”
believed to be the
new name for Project Q*.
Strawberry aims to enable AI models to plan ahead,
autonomously search the internet, and conduct deep research.
What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
LLMs are advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems designed to understand, generate, and process human language.
They are built using deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks, and are trained on vast amounts of text data.
Difference from Existing AI Models
Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) can summarize texts and compose prose but struggle with common sense problems and multi-step logic tasks.
Current LLMs cannot plan ahead effectively without external frameworks.
Strawberry models are expected to enhance AI reasoning, allowing for planning and complex problem-solving.
These models could enable AI to perform tasks that require a series of actions over an extended time, potentially revolutionizing AI’s capabilities.
Potential Applications of Strawberry Models
Advanced AI models could conduct experiments, analyze data, and suggest new hypotheses, leading to breakthroughs in sciences.
In medical research, AI could assist in drug discovery, genetics research, and personalized medicine analysis.
AI could solve complex mathematical problems, assist in engineering calculations, and participate in theoretical research.
AI could contribute to writing, creating art and music, generating videos, and designing video games.
Ethical Considerations
Impact on Jobs:
Improved AI capabilities may intensify concerns about job displacement and the ethical implications of AI reproducing human work.
Power Consumption and Ethics:
The vast amounts of power required to run advanced AI models raise environmental and ethical questions.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Elephant conservation in India
Why in the News?
Kerala’s forests have recorded 845 elephant deaths between 2015 and 2023.
Studies indicate an increasing trend in the death rate over time.
Habitat and Population Challenges
Elephants face increasing vulnerability due to shrinking habitats and rising fragmentation exacerbated by climate change.
Factors contributing to their susceptibility include:
Declining population sizes
Sensitivity to high temperatures
Competition from invasive plant species disrupting food sources
Heightened susceptibility to diseases
Elephant Mortality: Key Trends
Younger elephants
, particularly those
under 10 years of age
, face the highest risk of mortality.
The
mortality rate for
calves
is approximately
40%
The increase in deaths among calves is primarily due to
Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesviruses – Haemorrhagic Disease (EEHV-HD).
Influence of Herd Size on Survival:
A recent study in
Sri Lanka
highlights potential
mitigating factors against the herpesvirus
Calves in larger herds
exhibit
better survival
rates due to
shared immunity
Exposure to various virus strains within
larger herds helps calves develop antibodies
, improving their chances of survival.
