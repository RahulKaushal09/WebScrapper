Significance of GCC for India
India and GCC Relation
It is a political and economic alliance of six countries in the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE.
Established in 1981, the GCC promotes economic, security, cultural and social cooperation between the six states.
It holds a summit every year to discuss cooperation and regional affairs.
Introduction
The Gulf constitutes the immediate neighborhood of India separated only by the Arabian Sea.
The GCC has emerged as a major trading partner for India and it also has a vast potential as an important investment partner.
Geostrategic:
GCC countries sit across the Persian Gulf, which is an important sea lane for global trade. From the strategic point of view, India and GCC share the desire for political stability and security in the region.
Political Dialogue
The first-ever India-GCC Political Dialogue was held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in 2003.
India and GCC signed an MoU on the Mechanisms of Consultations in September 2022.
The MoU creates a framework for annual dialogue between
EAM and the GCC-Troika
(GCC-SG, Foreign Minister of the country holding current GCC presidency, and Foreign Minister of the country that will hold next GCC presidency), and any other Foreign Minister(s)/Senior Officials from the GCC countries.
Economic and Commercial Relations
Currently, the region is expanding beyond the energy sector into other fields, such as tourism, construction and finance. This opens up the opportunities for trade and investments for countries like India.
During FY 2023-24,
India-GCC bilateral trade stood at USD 161.59 billion
India’s exports were USD 56.3 billion in FY 2023-24, India’s imports were USD 105.3 billion in FY 2023-24.
India’s economic linkages with the GCC have increased steadily, especially due to growth in oil imports.
These have increased significantly in FY22 due to rising oil prices in the wake of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, as well as due to the resumption of demand following the COVID-19 disruption.
India-GCC Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
India and the GCC signed a Framework Agreement for enhancing and developing economic cooperation between the two sides in New Delhi in August 2004.
The India-GCC FTA is under negotiation and may benefit from some renewed momentum following the
India-UAE FTA
Energy cooperation
Together, the GCC countries possess almost half of the world’s oil reserves.
GCC contributes to ~
35% of India’s oil imports and 70% of gas imports
India is executing the second phase of its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Several GCC countries have expressed their interest in the same.
Indian Diaspora and remittances
According to latest figures, there are ~ 8.9 million Indian expats residing in GCC countries which is approximately 66% of non-resident Indians.
According to the RBI Remittances Survey 2021, the share of remittances from the GCC region in India’s inward remittances is estimated to have declined from more than 50% in 2016-17 to about 30% in 2020-21.
This still represents a major component of India’s total inward remittances.

**********Over 85% of Indian Districts Exposed to Extreme Climate Events
Why in the News?
More than 85% of districts in India are exposed to extreme climate events such as floods, droughts and cyclones, according to a new study.
What’s in Today’s Article?
India’s Vulnerability to Climate Extremes (Examples, Changing Risk Landscape, Solutions, etc.)
India’s Vulnerability to Climate Extremes:
India is witnessing an alarming rise in climate extremes, with over 85% of Indian districts vulnerable to floods, droughts, cyclones, and heatwaves.
According to a recent study by
IPE-Global
ESRI-India
, approximately 45% of districts are experiencing a significant shift in climate patterns, with regions traditionally prone to floods now facing droughts and vice versa.
This report highlights the urgency of climate action in the context of these escalating challenges.
Escalating Climate Extremes:
The study, which used
pentad-decadal analysis
(spanning 50 years from 1973 to 2023), identifies
nonlinear trends in climate patterns at the district level
. These include:
A two-fold increase in drought events (agricultural and meteorological)
A fourfold increase in cyclone events
A staggering rise in flood frequency, particularly in eastern, northeastern, and southern India.
The frequency and intensity of climate extremes in India have surged by
fourfold in recent decades
, with the last decade alone witnessing a fivefold increase.
Changing Risk Landscape:
India’s climate risk landscape is rapidly evolving.
For example, more than 60% of districts in states like Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Assam are experiencing multiple extreme climate events simultaneously.
Rising greenhouse gas emissions, unplanned urbanization, and unsustainable anthropogenic activities are exacerbating these hazards.
The report warns that India’s population is becoming increasingly exposed to these extremes.
By 2036, over 1.47 billion Indians will face severe climate risks
, making hyper-granular risk assessments critical to safeguarding the economy, particularly in sectors like agriculture and infrastructure.
Land Use & Environmental Changes:
The study also notes a
65% change in land-use and land-cover patterns
across climate hotspots.
Microclimatic shifts driven by deforestation, mangrove destruction, and unplanned land use are further contributing to the intensification of these events.
Swapping Trend:
A noteworthy finding of the study is the swapping trend seen in more than 45% of Indian districts.
Areas that once experienced frequent floods, such as Srikakulam, Cuttack, and Guntur, are now witnessing drought conditions, and vice versa
Southern states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka are particularly seeing a rise in drought occurrences.
Leveraging Technology for Resilience:
The study emphasized the role of GIS technology in building climate resilience.
With its advanced spatial analysis tools,
Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) can integrate diverse data sources to provide a geographical understanding of climate risks.
Solutions like the
Climate Risk Observatory
(CRO) can help stakeholders understand sector-specific impacts, fostering better planning and adaptation strategies.
The report also recommends
Infrastructure Climate Fund
(ICF) to support sustained investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, focusing on risk management and locally-led climate actions.
Conclusion:
India's climate crisis is a complex issue that needs immediate local solutions.
The IPE-Global and Esri study highlights the need for detailed risk assessments at the local level.
It also suggests creating climate resilience funds and focusing on both adaptation and mitigation strategies.
With proper investments and cooperation, India can lead global efforts in climate resilience and turn risks into opportunities for a sustainable future.

**********India overtakes China as most attractive emerging market for investing
Why in news?
India has overtaken China in the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Investable Market Index (IMI) for the first time,
becoming the largest country by weight
. However,
China still leads the MSCI Emerging Market Standard Index
The MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index (IMI) captures large, mid and small cap representation across 24 Emerging Markets (EM) countries. With 3,355 constituents, the index covers approximately 99% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each country.
What’s in today’s article?
Why India Remains Favorite Emerging Markets Growth Story for Investors
Challenges face by India
India overtakes China – key analysis
Why India Remains Favorite Emerging Markets Growth Story for Investors?
Background
Over the last decade, India emerged from being a
“fragile 5” economy to become the fifth-largest economy of the world
This is driven by a continuous focus on development, a range of structural reforms and anti-corruption initiatives.
India's stock market has surged by 46% over the past three years, outpacing global equities' 20% gain and the -13% decline in emerging market equities. Only the U.S. has performed similarly.
This strong growth has drawn global attention, prompting some investors to question if they've missed the opportunity.
With mixed headlines either praising India as the next growth engine or expressing concern over the rapid market rise, it becomes difficult to navigate the competing narratives.
What’s driving the Indian market?
Labo
India’s labor force underpins exciting prospects for manufacturing growth.
According to Bloomberg, over 48 million medium-skilled workers, largely in the manufacturing sector, could retire from China and developed economies from 2020-2040.
On the other hand, India could add over 38 million such workers
Capital
With a surge of infrastructure projects underway and
$1.7 trillion expected to be invested by 2030
, India is well-positioned to capitalize on these inflows.
This is especially timely as global manufacturers seek to diversify supply chains due to rising geopolitical tensions, creating a strong growth opportunity for the country.
Economic growth and fiscal prudence
The government’s focus on high economic growth with increased spending on infrastructure is helping India maintain a rapid pace of development.
India’s renewed focus on bringing down the deficits, as evident from Budget statements, also makes it an attractive destination.
The country’s economic fundamentals, coupled with its rising weight in global indices, make it an attractive destination for long-term investors.
Political stability
Political stability has played a significant role in driving India's growth and enhancing investor confidence in recent years.
Benefited from global investors turning negative towards China
India, to some extent, benefited from global investors turning negative towards China.
Productivity ad reforms
India's favorable labor and capital conditions support growth, but sustainable progress depends on productivity improvements through reforms.
Key areas include education and skills training to help workers transition from primary to secondary industries.
Over 40% of India’s workers are still employed in primary industry, nearly double the share in China.
Urbanization
(36% vs China’s 64%) also needs improvement to rehouse rural workers more efficiently.
Cutting red tape
and offering incentives for manufacturing have attracted business investment and should continue to drive growth.
Inflation
Increasing inflationary pressures present a short-term risk.
This is potentially resulting in tighter monetary policies, higher interest rates, declining asset prices, and currency depreciation in India.
Geopolitical tensions
Russia-Ukraine war and instability in the Middle East has created various challenges such as trade disruption, migration etc.
Global warming and climate change
It is posing significant risk to agricultural productivity, biodiversity and infrastructure, with implications for investments in India.
Attention from global investors
A rising weight in the MSCI EM index signals increased attention from global investors, which is particularly beneficial for India.
As India overtakes China to become the largest component of the MSCI EM IMI index, it is poised to attract more foreign portfolio flows.
India is no longer merely a tracking error in global portfolios
India is no longer merely a tracking error in global portfolios; instead, it has become a major component that cannot be ignored.
As a result, global funds may need to buy Indian exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or directly invest in Indian stocks.
More foreign participation in the Indian market in coming months
A warning sign
A rising index weight is typically positive but can signal market exuberance, which sometimes leads to underperformance, as seen with China.
While India's situation differs, historical patterns suggest caution.
The increase in India's index weight likely reflects stronger fundamentals, such as a larger free float and rising earnings, both of which are positive indicators.

**********Banking Sector Struggling with Slower Growth
Why in News?
According to the latest data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the banking sector has been struggling with slower growth in deposits compared to credit over the past few months.
As the gap increases between deposits (which customers keep with the bank and get interest for) and credit (which the bank lends to customers at an interest rate charged from them), it creates an asset-liability mismatch for lenders.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Analysing the Weak Deposit Growth in the Banking Sector
Concerns Over Slowing Bank Deposits and Efforts to Boost Them Up
Analysing the Weak Deposit Growth in the Banking Sector:
Higher credit-deposit gap:
In the quarter that ended in June 2024, bank deposits stood at 11.7%, while the bank credit growth stood at 15%, pointing to a higher credit-deposit gap.
The widening gap has concerned the government and the RBI, who
have asked lenders to focus more on deposit mobilisation through innovative products.
Major reasons for a slower growth in deposits:
The outflow of household savings from banks to capital markets
is one of the major reasons for a slower growth in deposits in the banking system.
After the Covid-19 pandemic
, the Indian capital markets have seen a surge in retail activity through
direct
(direct trading) and
indirect
(using mutual fund route) channels.
As per the Economic Survey 2023-24, the number of demat accounts with both depositories (NSDL and CDSL) rose from 11.45 crore in FY23 to 15.14 crore in FY24.
What has facilitated outflow of household savings from banks to capital markets?
Higher returns, robust digital infrastructure and rapid smartphone penetration (which have eased the investment process) have facilitated the entry of more retail investors into capital markets.
A rise in retail participation was more substantial through the
indirect channels via mutual funds,
insurance funds and pension funds.
For example,
the net AuM (assets under management) of the mutual fund industry grew by 6.23% to touch a record high of Rs 64.97 lakh crore as of July 31, 2024.
The mutual funds segment presently has about 9.33 crore
systematic investment plan (SIP)
accounts through which investors regularly invest in schemes.
Concerns Over Slowing Bank Deposits and Efforts to Boost Them Up:
Concerns:
While bank deposits continue to remain dominant as a percentage of financial assets owned by households,
their share has been declining
This trend has led to concerns that banks are increasingly relying on more expensive funding sources
like Certificates of Deposit (CDs),
which could impact their profitability.
Also, the slower deposit growth compared to credit
may potentially expose the system to structural liquidity issues
Efforts to boost bank deposits:
To meet the systemic credit demand, banks are trying to raise capital through
innovative initiatives
such as special deposit schemes.
SBI launched ‘
Amrit Vrishti
’, a scheme that offers 7.25% interest on deposits for 444 days.
Bank of Baroda also launched the ‘
Monsoon Dhamaka
’ deposit scheme, offering interest rates of 7.25% for 399 days and 7.15% for 333 days.
Outlook:
For the current financial year,
deposit tightness is likely to persist
, despite banks' efforts to strengthen their liability franchise.
The banking industry in India is working
hard to strike a delicate balance between continuing to support robust loan growth and charging higher interest rates for deposits
, which will probably keep banks' cost of funds high.
