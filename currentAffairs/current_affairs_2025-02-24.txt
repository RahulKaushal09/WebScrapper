Ex Gratia Payment
The Ministry of Railways handed over wads of cash in bundles of notes of Rs 100 and 50 after announcing that it would provide Rs 10 lakh ex-gratia to the kin of the 18 deceased in the stampede at the New Delhi Railway Station recently.
About Ex Gratia Payment:
It is a type of
payment
made by an organization, government, etc.,
to an individual for damages or claims without
recognizing
any legal obligation.
“Ex gratia” means “by favor” or
“by virtue of grace”
in Latin.
Thus, an ex gratia payment is a
voluntary payment
that is
not a part of an organization’s legal liability.
Ex gratia payments are
not common
since companies or other organizations are usually only willing to cover the payments under legal enforcement.
However, some organizations use ex gratia payments to express their
goodwil
l to maintain good long-term relationships with the payment receivers.
For example, a company experienced a bad year and decided to lay off a large number of employees.
In addition to compensating the employees according to legal terms, the company may also pay extra amounts to show its benevolence.
It can help the company to lower the negative effect of the job cuts on its public image.

**********Extended Reality (XR)
The XR Creator Hackathon is being organised by Wavelaps in association with the WAVES 2025 initiative of the Ministry Information and Broadcasting.
About Extended Reality (XR):
Extended reality (XR) represents a
fusion of immersive technologies
that blend the physical and virtual worlds,
encompassing virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),
mixed reality (MR)
All immersive technologies extend the reality we experience by either blending the virtual and “real” worlds or by creating a fully immersive experience.
Augmented Reality (AR):
In AR,
virtual information and objects
are
overlaid on the real world.
This experience
enhances the real world with digital details
such as images, text, and animation.
You can access the experience
through AR glasses or via screens
, tablets, and smart phones.
This means
users are not isolated from the real world
and can still interact and see what’s going on in front of them.
Virtual Reality (VR):
In contrast to AR, in a VR experience,
users are fully immersed in
simulated digital environment.
Individuals must put on a
VR headset or head-mounted display
to get a 360 -degree view of an
artificial world
that fools their brain into believing they are, e.g., walking on the moon, swimming under the ocean or stepping into whatever new world the VR developers created.
Mixed Reality (MR):
In mixed reality,
digital and real-world objects co-exist
interact with one another in real-time.
This is the latest immersive technology and is sometimes referred to as
hybrid reality.
It requires an MR headset and a lot more processing power than VR or AR.
World Audio Visual & Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025:
It is an
initiative of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,
Government of India.
WAVES 2025 is designed as a pivotal
platform for
ideas, collaboration, and innovation within the
media and entertainment (M&E) industry.
It will serve as a forum for India to position itself as a global leader in content creation, technology integration, and creative industry growth.

**********Pagri Sambhal Jatta movement
Recently, farmers protesting at the Punjab and Haryana borders are observed February 23 as Pagri Sambhal Diwas, in honour of Ajit Singh, paternal uncle of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh.
About Pagri Sambhal Jatta movement:
It was started by Ajit Singh in 1907, to protest against three
agricultural laws
imposed by the British.
‘Pagri Sambhal Jatta’ literally translates
to ‘take care of your turban, o farmer’,
and invokes self respect and honour.
The slogan “Pagri Sambhal Jatta” was coined by
Banke Dayal
, a nationalist poet, and it became a symbol of resistance.
The three laws were:
The Punjab Land Alienation Act, 1900; The Punjab Land Colonisation Act, 1906; and The Doab Bari Act, 1907.
restricted the rights of farmers to sell or mortgage their land freely. It favored moneylenders and landlords, making it difficult for peasants to escape debt.
gave the
British control over land ownership
in the newly developed Chenab Colony (now in Pakistan). Farmers had to transfer their land to the British government upon death instead of passing it to their heirs.
Doab Bari Act, 1907,
too, took away farmers’
ownership rights over their lands,
effectively reducing them to contract workers.
Along with this, the British raised taxes on agricultural land and water for irrigation, increasing the financial burden on farmers. Many small farmers and peasants were forced into debt.
Ajit Singh and Kishan Singh (Bhagat Singh’s father) formed the
Bharat Mata Society
, a revolutionary group for farmers.
Lala Lajpat Rai and other leaders also supported the movement.
Impact of the movement:
Pagri Sambhal Jatta was one of the first major farmer movements against British rule, laying the foundation for future resistance in Punjab.
The agitation led to mass protests and civil disobedience. Due to intense pressure, the British
government withdrew some of the oppressive clauses of the laws.
The movement inspired future protests, including the
Ghadar Movement
and Bhagat Singh’s revolutionary activities.

**********UGC-CARE list scrapped
Why in news?
The University Grants Commission (UGC) has decided to discontinue the UGC-CARE (Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics) list of quality academic journals, first introduced in 2018.
Instead, it will provide a set of suggestive parameters for selecting journals based on eight criteria.
What’s in today’s article?
Reasons for Withdrawing UGC-CARE
Concerns Over Scrapping the CARE List
The New Approach to Journal Evaluation
UGC-CARE was introduced in 2018 to combat the problem of predatory journals, journals that publish research in exchange for publishing fees without checks like peer reviews.
Reason for Setting Up UGC-CARE
Significance of Research Publications
Publications in journals play a crucial role in institutional rankings, faculty appointments, promotions, and research grants.
The quality of research publications directly impacts the credibility and funding of higher education institutions.
Rise of Predatory Journals
Due to the importance of journal publications, substandard and predatory journals proliferated, offering publication for a fee without rigorous peer review.
This led to concerns about academic integrity and India's global research reputation.
UGC’s Concern and Response
In 2019, the UGC highlighted the negative impact of publishing in dubious journals, warning of long-term academic damage.
An investigation by a leading media house, in 2018, revealed over 300 publishers operating predatory journals in India, charging fees between $30 and $1800 for publication.
Establishment of UGC-CARE
Following these concerns, UGC introduced the Consortium for Academic and Research Ethics (CARE) in 2018 to replace the previous system of university-suggested journals.
Under CARE, a dedicated UGC cell assessed journals based on strict quality protocols.
Concerns with the UGC-CARE List
The UGC-CARE list was introduced to ensure only reputable journals were considered for faculty selections, promotions, and research funding.
However, it faced several criticisms, including:
Over-centralisation
in deciding journal quality.
Delays
in adding or removing journals.
Limited inclusivity
, particularly in fields like Tamil studies.
Lack of transparency
, leading to the exclusion of highly respected Indian-language journals.
Shift to a Decentralised Approach
The UGC argues that decentralisation will:
Help combat predatory journals more effectively.
Make institutions responsible for evaluating journals.
Allow flexibility for institutions to develop their own mechanisms aligned with UGC’s suggested parameters.
Ensure evaluation models can adapt to evolving fields and disciplinary needs.
Expert Committee Review (2023)
The UGC formed an expert committee to review the CARE system. The decision to discontinue it in October 2023 was based on concerns about:
Over-regulation, as highlighted by NEP 2020, which criticized excessive centralisation.
Lack of transparency, with no clear reasoning for journal inclusions or exclusions.
Inefficiencies, including delays in adding high-quality journals and sudden removals affecting faculty careers.
Concerns from Academics
Experts pointed out that CARE was not exhaustive and created pressure to publish in specific journals.
Academics often receive offers to pay for publications, raising concerns about predatory practices.
Potential Rise of Predatory Journals
Academics fear that eliminating the CARE list
removes a key safeguard
against predatory journals.
Without a central oversight mechanism,
low-quality and exploitative journals may thrive
Lack of Public Consultation
Some experts believe the system was
still evolving
and could have helped curb predatory publishing.
An academic described the move as
“retrograde”
, arguing that there should have been
public consultation
before scrapping CARE.
Suggestive Parameters for Institutions
The UGC has introduced
non-binding ‘suggestive parameters’
to help institutions assess journals.
These parameters include evaluating
the journal’s editorial process, peer review system, and the expertise of its editorial board
Institutional Responsibility & Accountability
Institutions are now responsible for developing their own mechanisms to evaluate journals.
Failure to do so could harm their reputation by endorsing faculty publications in
Decentralisation & Academic Freedom
The new approach aims to
promote decentralisation, academic freedom, and institutional accountability
Faculty and researchers can assess journals
based on discipline-specific criteria
rather than relying on a centralised list.

**********Microsoft’s quantum computing breakthrough
Why in news?
Recently, Microsoft announced Majorana 1, a new
chip developed using engineered particles in a new state of matter, which the company sees as a breakthrough.
With this Microsoft aims to develop quantum computers capable of solving industrial-scale problems within years (2027-29) rather than decades.
Though, the company has not released any performance data on its quantum chip yet.
What’s in today’s article?
Microsoft’s Unique Approach to Quantum Computing
Quantum Computers vs Supercomputers vs Classical Computers
For the past 20 years, Microsoft has focused on developing topological qubits, which are more stable and require less error correction than traditional qubits.
Topological qubits are a more stable type of quantum bit, the basic unit of quantum computers.
They store information in the way specially engineered particles called
anyons
are arranged and braided, not in the particles themselves, making them less prone to errors.
Anyons are two-dimensional systems. They are neither fermions nor bosons, but have statistical properties in between the two.
Challenges in Creating Topological Qubits
Developing these qubits posed a steep learning curve, as
Majorana fermions
—particles that are their own antiparticles—had never been physically observed before.
A Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle in particle physics that is its own antiparticle, meaning it acts identically to its antiparticle.
Essentially, it is a fermion that can be considered as its own mirror image, unlike other particles which have distinct antiparticles.
Although theorized by Ettore Majorana over 80 years ago, evidence of a type known as
Majorana zero modes (MZMs)
has only emerged in the last decade.
MZM is a special type of quantum state that appears at the ends of certain topological superconductors.
It is characterized by being its own antiparticle, meaning it acts like both matter and antimatter simultaneously, and exists at zero energy.
Due to this it becomes a promising candidate for robust quantum computation.
Building a New Quantum Material: Topoconductors
To fabricate these new particles, Microsoft developed
topoconductors
, made by combining indium arsenide (a semiconductor) and aluminum (a superconductor).
Just as semiconductors enabled modern electronics, topoconductors pave the way for scalable quantum systems, potentially reaching a million qubits to solve complex industrial and societal challenges.
When cooled to near absolute zero and exposed to magnetic fields, these materials merge superconductivity with semiconductors, enabling the creation of a new type of qubit.
Microsoft’s Majorana 1 is an
eight-qubit chip
, which is modest compared to rivals like Google’s Willow (106 qubits) and IBM’s R2 Heron (156 qubits).
However, its Topological Core architecture could allow scaling up to a million qubits, a necessary threshold for solving real-world problems.
Majorana 1’s Design
Microsoft’s Majorana 1 chip features aluminum nanowires arranged in an "H" shape.
Each "H" structure has four controllable Majorana particles, forming a single qubit.
Potential Applications of Quantum Computing
Microsoft envisions Majorana 1 helping to develop breakthroughs such as:
Breaking down microplastics into harmless byproducts.
Inventing self-healing materials for construction, manufacturing, and healthcare.
Microsoft envisions using quantum computing with generative AI to design new materials or molecules through natural language input.
Quantum computing could generate synthetic data to improve AI model training.
Quantum systems are highly sensitive to environmental interference, causing errors.
Classical computers process information using binary code (bits) with values of either 0 or 1.
They rely on logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) to manipulate data.
Quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition).
A qubit can have probabilities assigned to both 0 and 1, allowing it to store and process more information than a classical bit.
Quantum gates (H-gate, Pauli gates) enable the processing of qubits and are reversible in nature.
Supercomputers use advanced architectures with GPUs and multi-core processing to perform calculations faster than regular computers.
Despite their power, they still follow classical computing principles and logic gates.
Quantum vs. Supercomputers
While supercomputers enhance classical processing speed, quantum computers can solve complex problems that classical and supercomputers cannot.
Quantum gates enable unique computational abilities beyond traditional logic gates.

**********Supreme Court’s View on Gag Orders
Why in the News?
Recently, the Supreme Court granted interim protection from arrest to podcaster and influencer Ranveer Allahbadia in connection with the First Information Reports (FIRs) registered against him over remarks made on the YouTube show “India Got Latent”.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, Background)
Gag Orders (Legal Basis, Supreme Court’s Speech Restrictions, Previous Judgements, Future Implications, etc.)
Introduction:
The Supreme Court of India has repeatedly ruled on
gag orders
, which prevent individuals from making public statements or publishing content.
recent case of influencer Ranveer Allahbadia
, who was granted
interim relief from arrest but banned from posting on social media
, highlights the
judicial approach toward speech restrictions
Background: The Ranveer Allahbadia Case
On
February 18, 2025
, a podcaster and influencer, over multiple FIRs related to alleged
obscene and explicit content
on the YouTube show India Got Latent.
However, the Court
imposed stringent conditions
, barring Allahbadia and his associates from posting any content on social media until further orders. Additionally, he was directed to surrender his passport.
This
controversial restriction
, effectively a
, contradicts prior Supreme Court rulings, which have cautioned against imposing excessive speech restrictions while granting bail or interim relief.
Legal Basis for Gag Orders in India:
refers to
judicial or executive action that prohibits individuals from making public statements
. Such orders usually fall under:
Section 144 of CrPC
– Allows the government to restrict public statements in cases of
law and order concerns
Contempt of Court Act, 1971
– Prohibits public discussion on
ongoing legal cases
to prevent judicial influence.
Article 19(2) of the Indian Constitution
reasonable restrictions
on free speech for security, public order, and morality.
However, courts have
consistently ruled that speech restrictions must be proportionate and justified
Supreme Court's Principles on Interim Relief and Speech Restrictions:
Discretionary Conditions for Interim Relief
Judges have the discretion to impose conditions when granting
. These conditions are typically based on:
Flight risk
– Whether the accused may
abscond from trial
Tampering with evidence
– If the accused could
interfere with investigations
Intimidation of witnesses
– Preventing threats or coercion.
However, courts have ruled that restrictions
must not violate fundamental rights
Key Supreme Court Rulings on Gag Orders:
Parteek Bansal vs. State of Rajasthan (2022)
Supreme Court condemned the practice of multiple FIRs
for the same offense, calling it
harassment and misuse of legal machinery
Relevance:
This case supports Allahbadia’s argument against
multiple FIRs in different states
Satender Kumar Antil vs. CBI (2022)
The Supreme Court ruled that
bail conditions must be reasonable
, warning against
imposing impossible or unjustified restrictions
The Allahbadia order
contradicts this ruling
, as barring him from social media
affects his profession
Frank Vitus vs. Narcotics Control Bureau (2024)
The Court
struck down bail conditions
requiring the accused to
share Google Maps location
, ruling it
violated privacy under Article 21
The Allahbadia gag order
violates free speech rights under Article 19
Rehana Fathima Case (2021)
stayed a Kerala High Court order restricting activist Rehana Fathima
from posting content while on bail, ruling that such conditions
create a chilling effect on speech
The Allahbadia case
raises similar concerns
, as his gag order
restricts online expression
Mohammed Zubair vs. Uttar Pradesh (2021)
refused to prohibit Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair from tweeting while on bail
, stating it would be
an unjustified violation of free speech
The Allahbadia case presents
identical legal challenges
, as the Court
restricted speech as a bail condition
Criticism of the Recent Order of the Supreme Court:
Legal experts argue that the
social media ban is excessive
, as:
The case does not involve national security or law and order threats.
Speech bans violate Supreme Court precedents on bail conditions.
The order indirectly affects digital content creators and free expression online.
Even if Allahbadia’s content is found objectionable, the
IT Act and media regulations provide alternative legal measures
rather than outright speech bans.
Future Implications for Digital Speech in India:
Need for Clear Guidelines on Gag Orders
Courts must define when speech restrictions can be imposed as bail conditions, ensuring consistency in rulings.
Balancing Free Speech and Legal Restrictions
The government and judiciary must strike a balance between regulation and speech freedoms, ensuring prior restraint is imposed only in exceptional cases.
Strengthening Legal Safeguards Against Arbitrary Bans
Gag orders should be time-bound and subject to review.
Affected parties must have the right to challenge speech restrictions in court.
Conclusion:
The Supreme Court’s interim order in the Ranveer Allahbadia case raises critical questions on free speech, prior restraint, and judicial overreach.
Past rulings have consistently cautioned against excessive speech restrictions, making the social media ban controversial.
Going forward, a well-defined legal framework is necessary to ensure gag orders are applied only in exceptional circumstances and do not unjustly infringe upon fundamental rights.

**********Ensuring Electoral Integrity - The Controversy Over Election Commission Appointments
Context:
India, as the world’s largest democracy, relies on the Election Commission of India (
ECI
) to conduct
free and fair elections
.
Concerns have been raised regarding the
appointment process of Election Commissioners (ECs)
and its impact on the independence of the ECI.
Civil society organizations (CSOs) and political leaders have long demanded a
transparent and bipartisan appointment process
The Role of Civil Society Organizations in Electoral Reforms:
Several CSOs
, including Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), Internet Freedom Foundation, etc. have been advocating for electoral reforms.
has been at the forefront, filing legal challenges to reform the EC appointment process.
Legal Battle for a Transparent Appointment Process:
2015:
ADR filed a petition challenging the
executive’s exclusive control
over EC appointments, citing concerns over independence.
2018:
The case was referred to a Constitution Bench, but hearings were delayed.
March 2, 2023:
Anoop Baranwal vs Union of India
, the Supreme Court (SC) noted that no legislation outlining the appointment process for these positions had been passed in more than 70 years.
This is in spite of the constitutional provision under
Article 324(2)
that required Parliament to pass a law.
It ruled that, until Parliament enacts a law, the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and ECs
should be appointed by a committee comprising:
The Prime Minister
The Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha
The Chief Justice of India (CJI)
The ruling aimed to
reduce executive dominance and ensure transparency
The 2023 Legislation and Its Controversies:
The government passed the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service, and Term of Office)
Act, 2023
modifying the SC’s ruling
The Act
excluded the CJI
from the selection panel. Instead, it created
a new selection committee comprising:
A Union Cabinet Minister (nominated by the PM)
Critics argue that this change
undermines impartiality
, as the executive holds a majority in the selection panel.
Judicial Review and Government Action:
January 2024:
ADR and other petitioners challenged the 2023 Act in the SC, arguing it allowed the
ruling party to dominate the selection process
March 2024:
Despite the pending judicial review, the government
appointed two new ECs
under the new selection framework.
February 18, 2025:
The incumbent CEC retired, and the government made
new appointments via a midnight order.
February 19, 2025:
The SC was scheduled to hear the case but adjourned it without a new date,
prolonging uncertainty.
Global Best Practices in EC Appointments:
United States:
Commissioners appointed by the President with Senate approval.
South Africa:
President appoints on the recommendation of the National Assembly.
Brazil:
Appointments made by the Federal Supreme Court.
United Kingdom:
The Speaker’s Committee on the Electoral Commission (cross-party) makes appointments.
France:
Joint appointments by the President, Legislature, and Judiciary.
Nepal:
President appoints CEC and ECs based on recommendations from the Constitutional Council, followed by a parliamentary hearing.
Way Forward:
The integrity of India’s electoral process hinges on the
independence and impartiality
of the Election Commission,
real and visible
The need of the hour is to embrace
a bipartisan and neutral collegium-based appointment system
, drawing from global best practices.
This would not only fortify the ECI’s
autonomy
but also
bolster public confidence in the democratic process.
Conclusion:
The 2023 Act
has been criticized for reintroducing executive control over EC appointments, despite the SC’s attempt to ensure impartiality.
If the government reinstates the CJI in the selection panel, legal challenges could be resolved.
The issue remains unresolved, with the

**********Talent Shortage, Global challenge, India’s opportunity
Context
The
global labour market is undergoing a significant transformation
, and it is evident that the skills required in 2030 will be markedly different from those needed today.
This
shift presents both a challenge and an opportunity for India.
While the world faces an impending shortage of skilled workers, India is uniquely positioned to leverage its workforce potential.
However,
to fully capitalise on this opportunity, India must address various challenges
, including regulatory barriers, skill mismatches, and immigration restrictions.
An Overview of The Global Talent Shortage and India’s Potential
recent study by FICCI-KPMG
, Global Mobility of Indian Workforce,
predicts a global talent shortage of over 85.2 million people by 2030,
which could result in $8.45 trillion in unrealised annual revenue.
This underscores the
urgent need for nations to develop a future-ready workforce.
, with its vast pool of young and skilled workers,
has a unique opportunity to fill this gap
and contribute significantly to the global economy.
realising this potential requires strategic interventions at multiple levels,
including government policies, international collaborations, and workforce training programs.
Key Geographic Regions and Sectoral Demands
GCC and Australia:
These regions have a
strong demand for workers in manufacturing and construction,
sectors that require large-scale labour mobility.
Europe:
As one of the oldest post-industrial societies,
Europe has a growing need for service-sector workers
, particularly in healthcare, due to its aging population.
Emerging Sectors:
Across all regions,
there is a rising demand for expertise in automation, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, predictive analytics
, the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and sustainability.
Barriers to Workforce Mobility and Strategies to Enhance Workforce Mobility
Regulatory and Immigration Barriers –
Complex visa processes and stringent work permit regulations restrict skilled migration
Recruitment Malpractices and Trafficking –
Exploitative recruitment practices and human trafficking pose risks to migrant workers, a concern highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Policy Barriers and Skill Mismatches –
Many Indian degrees, particularly in medicine, are not universally recognized, leading to underemployment or unemployment of skilled professionals.
Language and Cultural Barriers
– Integration challenges, such as language proficiency and cultural adaptation, affect workforce productivity.
Bilateral Agreements and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs):
Agreements with GCC nations and other key markets aim to protect the rights of Indian workers and facilitate their smooth migration.
Skill Development Programs:
Government initiatives focus on aligning workforce training with global market demands.
Digital Platforms for Workforce Support:
Online recruitment systems are designed to prevent exploitation and protect migrant workers, especially in the GCC region.
Sector-Specific Skill Training:
Training programs must be tailored to meet the specific demands of different geographic regions.
Regulation of Recruitment Practices:
Stricter oversight of recruitment agencies is necessary to prevent worker exploitation.
Recognition of Qualifications:
International collaborations should ensure mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications.
Public-Private Partnerships:
The private sector should play an active role in skill development and global employment facilitation.
Circular Migration and Mobility:
Temporary work visas and rotational workforce models can help address labour shortages while maintaining demographic balance
The Political Climate, India’s Resilience and Economic Future and the Road to ‘Viksit Bharat’
The Political Climate and India’s Resilience
The political climate regarding immigration policies is constantly evolving.
While Europe may tighten its regulations,
Australia remains more open to skilled migration.
FICCI-KPMG study
highlights that the
Indian diaspora in Australia is one of the largest and fastest-growing.
Strict immigration policies mainly target illegal migration,
making it crucial for India to position its skilled workforce globally while ensuring legal compliance.
Unlike some other migrant groups,
Indian workers generally face minimal hostility
in international labour markets.
India must continue efforts to curb illegal migration to maintain its positive global reputation
and safeguard its workers from exploitation.
India’s Economic Future and the Road to ‘Viksit Bharat’
India’s ability to capitalise on global labour market
opportunities will significantly
influence its economic trajectory.
Arvind Panagariya,
Chairman of the Sixteenth Finance Commission
, has projected that
India’s GDP could reach between $6.5 trillion and $9 trillion by 2030.
extent to which India taps into the $8.45 trillion global economic opportunity
determine how close it gets to the higher end
of this projection.
By effectively addressing workforce mobility challenges and strategically positioning its skilled labour force in international markets
, India can not only contribute to the global economy but also realize its vision of Viksit Bharat, a developed India.
Conclusion
As the global labour market undergoes a transformation,
India stands at a crucial juncture.
With a rapidly growing workforce,
the country has a unique opportunity to fill the talent shortage projected for 2030.
achieving this goal requires a coordinated effort involving government policies, skill development initiatives
, and international collaborations.
By addressing regulatory challenges
, streamlining workforce mobility, and leveraging its young and skilled population,
India can secure a significant share of the global labour market and drive its own economic growth in the process.

**********Indian Industry Needs Innovation, Not Mindless Toil
Context
The
recent debate surrounding corporate leaders urging Indians to work longer hours
sheds light on the structural issues in India's labour market.
While these appeals might stem from a desire for economic growth,
they fail to acknowledge the harsh realities of India’s predominantly informal workforce.
over-reliance on cheap labour,
rather than technological advancement,
continues to hinder India's long-term industrial progress.
Amid these debates,
it is important to examine the implications of this labour-dependent strategy, highlighting its impact on productivity
, innovation, and economic sustainability.
The Informality of India's Workforce
India’s workforce is overwhelmingly informal,
with only 21.7% of workers in salaried jobs
, according to the 2023-24 Periodic Labour Force Survey.
Even among these salaried workers,
nearly half lack formal contracts, paid leave, or social security.
call for longer working hours disregards the reality that most Indian workers
, particularly manual labourers and household helpers, already endure gruelling schedules simply to survive.
Unlike developed nations
where productivity gains have reduced working hours,
India continues to extract economic value by extending the workday
rather than improving efficiency.
Striking Aspects of India’s Industrial Structure
Cheap Labour as a Competitive Strategy
One of the most striking aspects of India’s industrial structure is its
heavy reliance on cheap labour as the primary source of competitive advantage.
Instead of investing in technological innovation, automation, or efficient management practices,
Indian businesses continue to extract economic gains
by keeping wages low and increasing working hours.
This approach, while beneficial for short-term profits
, ultimately hinders long-term economic growth and industrial competitiveness.
A Historical Perspective: The Evolution of Labour Exploitation
Throughout history,
economies have used labour-intensive methods to drive industrial growth, particularly in their early stages.
During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, factories exploited workers
by enforcing excessively long hours under inhumane conditions.
Karl Marx famously described how capitalists had a ‘werewolf hunger for surplus labour
,’ pushing workers beyond their physical limits in pursuit of higher profits.
However,
by the mid-19th century, labour reforms, unionisation, and technological progress led to a shift from sheer labour exploitation
to efficiency-driven productivity.
The Structural Shift Toward Informality
have systematically
shifted away from the organised sector
, where labour laws ensure minimum wages, job security, and worker benefits, to the unorganised sector, where such regulations are largely absent.
This structural transformation has allowed industries to sidestep labour protections
and exploit workers without facing legal repercussions.
One of the key strategies used
to maintain low labour costs
is the proliferation of small, unregistered firms.
Industrial hubs such as Coimbatore and Ludhiana are filled with micro-enterprises
, often operating in small sheds, producing components that feed into larger manufacturing networks.
These businesses lack formal employer-employee relationships
, with many owners being former workers themselves.
In such environments, wages remain depressed, and technological investment is minimal.
The Rise of Contract Labour and Migrant Workforces
Another major factor in the
persistence of the cheap-labour model is the increasing use of contract workers.
Over half (56%) of all workers who joined India’s factory sector after 2011-12 were employed on a contract basis
rather than as permanent employees.
Contract workers receive
significantly lower wages
and are excluded from essential benefits such as job security, health insurance, and pension schemes.
Moreover,
India's industry relies heavily on migrant workers who leave their villages in search of employment
in urban and industrial centres.
workers often belong to disadvantaged social groups
, lack access to land or assets, and have no bargaining power in the labour market.
As a result,
they are forced to accept extremely low wages
and poor working conditions.
Why Cheap Labour Fails as a Long-Term Strategy
Low Productivity and Stagnation
Unlike developed economies, where productivity growth drives economic expansion,
India’s reliance on cheap labour has stifled innovation.
Businesses remain reluctant to invest in technology or skill development,
leading to a workforce that is overworked but underproductive.
Weak Domestic Demand
Suppressing wages weakens the purchasing power of the working class,
limiting the growth of the domestic market.
When a large segment of the population earns barely enough to survive, demand for consumer goods, services, and housing remains low, slowing economic progress.
Inability to Compete Globally
India's failure to modernise its industries has
resulted in declining competitiveness in global markets.
The garment industry is a prime example.
Despite its abundant workforce,
India’s share in global garment exports has remained stagnant at 3.1% for two decades
In contrast, countries like China, Bangladesh, and Vietnam have invested in modern factories, automation, and efficient management practices, allowing them to dominate the sector.
Increased Worker Exploitation and Social Unrest
continued exploitation of workers
, through long hours, low wages, and informal contracts, leads to worsening living conditions,
rising income inequality, and social unrest.
Without adequate protections,
workers remain trapped in cycles of poverty, preventing overall economic development.
The Case of the Garment Industry: A Lost Opportunity
India’s garment industry
exemplifies how over-reliance on cheap labour has stunted progress.
India has failed to expand its share in global garment exports beyond 3.1% over the past two decades.
China, Bangladesh, and Vietnam have surged ahead due to their willingness to modernise and invest in productivity-enhancing technology
Indian manufacturers, by clinging to the advantage of low wages, have remained uncompetitive in the global market.
A similar problem plagues India’s IT and other new-generation industries
, where the reluctance to invest in workforce skill development and technological infrastructure limits their potential.
Instead of creating a high-value, innovation-driven economy,
industry leaders continue to rely on extensive work hours and minimal wages to sustain profits.
The Need for a New Industrial Strategy
Invest in Technology and Automation
: Embracing advanced manufacturing technologies, artificial intelligence, and automation can boost productivity without extending working hours.
Prioritise Skill Development
: Enhancing workforce skills through education and vocational training will create a more capable and efficient labour force.
Strengthen Labour Laws and Worker Protections
: Enforcing fair wages, job security, and social benefits will not only improve living standards but also stimulate domestic consumption.
Encourage Formalisation of Enterprises
: Incentivising businesses to operate within the formal sector will promote accountability, better wages, and stable employment opportunities.
Conclusion
India’s continued dependence
as a competitive strategy is
While it has provided
short-term gains for industries, it has stifled innovation, weakened domestic demand,
and limited global competitiveness.
If Indian industry is to thrive in the 21st century, it must move beyond exploitative labour practices
and adopt a more forward-thinking approach that prioritises productivity, innovation, and worker welfare.
shift from a labour-intensive model to a technology-driven economy will be critical
in ensuring long-term industrial and economic growth.

Exploitation via Contract Work:
56% of workers joining the factory sector since 2011-12 are contract workers, lacking legal protection and receiving lower wages.
Migrant Worker Vulnerability:
Migrant workers face multiple disadvantages due to social position, lack of assets, and inadequate access to social security.
Profit Maximization:
Industries prioritize profit over worker welfare, with profit shares rising from
31.6% in 2019-20 to 46.4% in 2021-22
in the factory sector.
What is the current situation of the garment industry in India?
Stagnant Share in Global Exports:
India’s share in
global garment exports
has remained
stagnant at 3.1%
over the past two decades.
Example:
In contrast,
Bangladesh (7.9%)
Vietnam (6.4%)
have increased their market share by investing in modern technologies and efficient supply chains (Economic and Political Weekly, August 2024).
Over-Reliance on Cheap Labour:
The industry depends heavily on
low-cost, unorganized labour
rather than
technology and automation
, limiting productivity.
70% of the workforce
in garment manufacturing operates in
small, unregistered enterprises
with poor working conditions and low wages (PLFS 2023-24).
Declining Competitiveness:
Rising competition from
China
has reduced India’s competitiveness in both
mass-market
premium
garment segments.
textile and garment exports
dropped by
13.3%
$32 billion
, while Vietnam’s exports rose to
$44 billion
(Ministry of Commerce data, 2024).
Lack of Innovation and Modernization:
Indian firms lag in
adopting advanced production technologies

Limited Collaboration between Industry and Academia:
Weak ties between academic research institutions and industries hinder the commercialization of innovative ideas.
36 patents
were filed jointly by Indian universities and private firms compared to
5,000+
in China under their “Industry-Academia Collaboration” model.
Lack of Policy Incentives for Innovation:
Insufficient government policies and weak implementation of initiatives like
Atal Innovation Mission (AIM)
reduce incentives for private-sector innovation.
China’s “Made in China 2025”
policy incentivizes innovation-led manufacturing, India’s
PLI (Production-Linked Incentive)
scheme primarily focuses on
rather than R&D-driven innovation.
Financial Constraints on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs):
SMEs, which form
70% of the manufacturing workforce
, face difficulties accessing credit for innovation and upgrading technology.
Despite initiatives like
15%
of MSMEs in India receive formal credit, limiting their ability to invest in new technologies.
Way forward:

“
, meaning
Take care of your turban, O farmer
,”
was coined by
Banke Dayal
, a nationalist poet, and became a symbol of
self-respect and protest
