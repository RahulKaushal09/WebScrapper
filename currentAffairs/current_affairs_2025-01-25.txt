Essential Religious Practices Doctrine
Bombay HC on Loudspeaker Use: Key Directives
Essential Religious Practices (ERP) Doctrine
It governs which religious practices are protected under Arts. 25 & 26 of the Constitution.
Overview
The doctrine is a legal framework created by the Supreme Court to balance the competing interests of freedom of religion and the state's ability to regulate practices.
It protects only those religious practices that are deemed essential to a particular religion.
Key Features
Freedom of Religion
: The doctrine protects practices that are essential to a religion, under the freedom of religion provisions in the Indian Constitution.
State's Role in Social Reforms
: The doctrine allows the state to implement social reforms without infringing on essential religious practices.
Bifurcation of Practices
: It distinguishes between essential and non-essential religious practices, offering protection only to those considered essential.
Historical Context
First Articulation
: The doctrine was first articulated in the 1954 case The Commissioner Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt.
Criticism
: The application of the doctrine has been criticized for being inconsistent and incoherent.
Notable Examples
The Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali (1961)
: The court ruled that only practices that are essential and integral to a religion are protected.
Ismail Faruqui v. Union of India (1994)
: The court ruled that a mosque is not an essential practice for the religion of Islam.
In a significant ruling, the Bombay High Court has declared that the use of loudspeakers is not an essential practice of any religion.
Court Observations
Loudspeaker use is not an essential part of any religion and is not protected under Article 25 (freedom of religion).
Noise pollution is a public health hazard and should be strictly controlled to safeguard citizens' rights.
Law enforcement must ensure compliance with noise regulations and avoid being passive in such cases.
Case Background
Residents of Nehru Nagar, Kurla East, filed a plea citing noise pollution by religious places beyond permissible decibel limits and hours.
Permissible limits
55 decibels (daytime) and 45 decibels (nighttime) in residential areas.
Complaints to local police stations were ignored, leading to the petition in the Bombay High Court.
Police must measure decibel levels using mobile applications and seize equipment violating noise norms.
Initial violations should result in warnings; repeated offenses may lead to fines, equipment seizure, and license cancellation.
Police must ensure complainant anonymity to prevent retaliation.

**********Research Identifies Tamil Nadu as the Birthplace of the Iron Age
Why in news?
A groundbreaking study suggests the Iron Age in Tamil Nadu began as early as 3,345 BCE, pushing back the region's iron usage timeline by over a millennium and challenging previous historical beliefs.
Th report was authored by K Rajan (Pondicherry University) and R Sivanantham (Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology).
What’s in today’s article?
Iron age in India
Key Findings of the study
Significance of this study
The Iron Age in India marked a transformative period characterized by the widespread use of iron tools and weapons, significantly advancing agriculture, warfare, and societal structures.
Initially believed to have begun between 1500 and 2000 BCE, recent discoveries in Tamil Nadu have pushed the timeline back to as early as 3345 BCE.
Technological Advancements
The Iron Age marked a significant leap in metallurgy, succeeding the Copper-Bronze Age.
Iron smelting required advanced furnaces capable of reaching 1534°C.
Archaeological Evidence
North India
: Early iron use was linked to Painted Grey Ware (PGW) cultures in sites like Hastinapur, Kausambi, and Ujjain.
Central India and Deccan
: Iron-bearing Black and Red Ware (BRW) levels were found in Nagda, Eran, and Prakash.
South India
: Iron artefacts appeared during the overlap of the Neolithic and Megalithic phases.
Urbanization and Agriculture
Iron tools, like axes and ploughs, were pivotal in clearing forests and expanding agriculture, contributing to the second urbanization in the Ganga valley (800–500 BCE).
Social and Economic Impact
Iron technology facilitated forest clearance, agricultural growth, and urbanization, leading to increased socio-economic stratification.
The period also witnessed the emergence of chiefdoms, states, and trading networks, culminating in the Mauryan Empire's integration of diverse regions.
The Iron Age laid the foundation for India's agrarian and urban transformations, influencing subsequent socio-political developments.
Key Findings of the Study
The report,
‘Antiquity of Iron: Recent Radiometric Dates from Tamil Nadu’
, provides evidence that iron technology in Tamil Nadu existed as early as 3345 BCE.
The findings are supported by
Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS)
Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL)
Archaeological Sites Studied
Iron-age samples were examined from key sites such as Sivagalai, Adichanallur, Mayiladumparai, and Kilnamandi, confirming Tamil Nadu's advanced metallurgical history.
Key Archaeological Discoveries
: Evidence from charcoal and potsherds dates iron technology to 2953–3345 BCE, with a paddy sample dated to 1155 BCE.
: Samples dated to 2172 BCE surpassed previous benchmarks for the region.
: A sarcophagus burial dated to 1692 BCE is the earliest of its kind in Tamil Nadu.
Tamil Nadu: A Pioneer in Metallurgy
The findings establish Tamil Nadu as an innovator in early metallurgy.
Smelted iron, dated to the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, shows the region’s technological sophistication.
The Study hypothesise that the
Copper Age of North India and the Iron Age of South India were contemporaneous, reflecting unique cultural trajectories
Advanced Iron-Smelling Techniques
Three distinct iron-smelting furnaces were identified at:
Kodumanal
: Circular furnaces capable of reaching 1,300°C, sufficient for sponge iron production.
Chettipalayam and Perungalur
: Showcased other innovative smelting techniques.
These discoveries highlight Tamil Nadu's advanced understanding of pyro-technology and its ability to produce durable tools and weapons.
Iron Age Timeline in India Revised
Previously believed to have emerged between 1500 and 2000 BCE, the Iron Age in India has been pushed back by new data from Tamil Nadu.
Radiometric dating of a paddy sample from a burial urn in Sivagalai places iron usage as far back as 3345 BCE, marking the earliest recorded evidence of iron technology globally.
Global Implications
Globally, the Iron Age has been attributed to the Hittite Empire (1300 BCE), but Tamil Nadu’s findings challenge this timeline.
Turning point in Indian archaeology
These findings represent a turning point in Indian archaeology, rewriting the history of the Iron Age and positioning Tamil Nadu as a key player in global metallurgical innovation.

**********At 75, Constitutional Justice and Personal Liberty
Context
As we celebrate 75 years of the Constitution of India,
it is imperative to reflect not just on its achievements but also on the challenges to its core values.
The Constitution
, envisioned by its framers as a beacon of justice, equality, and liberty,
finds itself mired in an ethical and moral crisis.
it is important to examine historical and contemporary dimensions of the struggle for personal liberty,
with a focus on the reinvigoration of dissent as a constitutional ethic and the role of the judiciary in safeguarding justice.
The Role of Dissent in Constitutional Ethics
The Pillar of Democracy
Dissent forms
the lifeblood of a vibrant democracy
, embodying the spirit of free expression and critique that is essential for societal progress.
Within the constitutional framework of India,
dissent is not merely a right but a fundamental ethic that safeguards the balance between state power and individual freedoms.
The Supreme Court’s evolving stance on dissent
, as seen in key judgments,
underscores its critical role in upholding the moral and ethical spirit
of the Constitution.
The Foundational Challenge: A.K. Gopalan vs State of Madras
defining moment in the jurisprudence of dissent was the case of A.K. Gopalan vs State of Madras (1950
), which tested the nascent Constitution's commitment to personal liberty.
majority opinion in the case adopted a compartmentalized interpretation of fundamental rights
, allowing preventive detention to stand without rigorous scrutiny.
However,
Justice S. Fazl Ali's dissenting opinion offered a broader, more integrated understanding of liberty,
emphasising its inseparability from justice and dignity.
While his views were not adopted at the time, they laid the groundwork for future interpretations
that sought to reconcile the Constitution’s technical provisions with its overarching ethical values.
The Revival of Dissent: Puttaswamy vs Union of India
significance of dissent was reinstated decades later in Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017),
a landmark judgment that affirmed the fundamental right to privacy.
By
referencing Justice Fazl Ali's dissent, the Supreme Court acknowledged the flaws in earlier majority judgments
that had curtailed liberty.
This
recognition of dissent as a constitutional ethic marked a shift toward a more expansive understanding of justice
, one that places personal liberty and human dignity at the centre of constitutional interpretation.
Dissent as a Shield Against State Overreach
Dissent, as a constitutional value, is vital not only for challenging state overreach
but also for
enriching public discourse.
It
acts as a counterweight to the centralisation of power
, ensuring that diverse perspectives are heard and respected.
principle resonates with B.R. Ambedkar’s vision of the Constitution as a dynamic document capable of holding the country together
by accommodating differing views and fostering a culture of dialogue.
Beyond Judicial Rulings
the role of dissent in constitutional ethics extends beyond judicial pronouncements.
requires an active commitment from all branches of government and civil society to protect and promote the right to dissent.
Preamble to the Constitution,
with its emphasis on justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity,
provides a moral compass for navigating conflicts and ensuring that dissent is not criminalised
or suppressed.
The Paradox of Dissent in Contemporary India
Despite the judiciary’s recognition
of dissent as a constitutional value, its
criminalisation has intensified in recent years.
Preventive detention, arbitrary arrests,
and the denial of fair trials
have become tools to suppress dissent.
The experiences of activists like Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, and Gulfisha Fatima jailed for their resistance to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).
It echoes the struggles of A.K. Gopalan,
who faced imprisonment and re-arrest under colonial and post-independence laws.
irony lies in the fact that laws originally designed to uphold colonial rule have been repurposed to stifle dissent
in independent India.
The notion that
‘the process has become the punishment’ aptly describes the plight of contemporary dissenters.
Lessons from the Journey of Constitutional Governance in India: The Role of Judiciary
The Ethical Responsibility of Courts
The judiciary
, as the guardian of constitutional values,
has an ethical responsibility to protect personal liberty and dissent.
While the Supreme Court has, in some instances, demonstrated a commitment to these principles—such as in the Puttaswamy judgment,
it has often fallen short in addressing systemic issues.
reluctance to grant bail to dissenters
, the deferment of crucial hearings, and the endorsement of broadly worded anti-terror laws
contribute to a culture of impunity.
underscores the necessity for “creative constitutionalism
,” a term coined by Professor Upendra Baxi, which advocates for an imaginative and justice-oriented interpretation of constitutional provisions.
Avoiding Historical Repetition
The failure to learn from history risks repeating its mistakes.
K. G. Kannabiran’s observation that the Gopalan judgment represented an “Indian-made foreign judgment”
is a sobering reminder of how colonial laws and mindsets have persisted in post-independence India.
Seventy-five years after the adoption of the Constitution,
the judiciary has an opportunity to correct this legacy by ensuring that laws are interpreted and applied
in ways that further justice rather than perpetuate oppression.
Constitution must not be allowed to become a tool for state control
; instead, it must remain a beacon of hope for those who challenge injustice.
Upholding Justice as the Constitution’s Ultimate Goal
essence of creative constitutionalism lies in its commitment to justice
as the ultimate goal of the Constitution.
Ambedkar envisioned the Constitution as a living document
capable of adapting to the needs of a dynamic society.
To honour this vision,
courts must actively engage with the ethical dimensions of constitutional interpretation,
prioritising human dignity and liberty over procedural rigidity.
By doing so,
the judiciary can ensure that the Constitution remains a transformative force that empowers citizens and safeguards democracy.
The Path Forward:
Creative Constitutionalism
Creative constitutionalism calls for
a departure from rigid proceduralism and an embrace of judicial innovation to uphold the ethical spirit of the Constitution.
involves interpreting fundamental rights expansively,
prioritising personal liberty, and ensuring that laws and state actions align with constitutional values.
Courts must actively address the misuse of preventive detention laws and anti-terror statutes
, ensuring that these measures are not used to stifle dissent or target marginalised communities.
Additionally,
the judiciary must develop a culture of urgency in cases involving personal liberty, recognizing that delayed justice often amounts to denied justice.
Conclusion
The Constitution of India represents a vision of justice, equality, and liberty
that transcends generations.
However, its promise remains unfulfilled
as long as dissent is criminalised and personal liberty is compromised.
The struggles of past and present dissenters
serve as a stark reminder of
the distance yet to be traversed.
By embracing creative constitutionalism
and prioritising the dignity and liberty of individuals,
India can move closer to realising the transformative potential of its Constitution.

**********Foundational Values, the Journey of the Indian State
Context
As India celebrates the 75th anniversary of the enforcement of its Constitution,
it is a pivotal moment to
reflect on the nation's journey while reaffirming its foundational values.
This
transformative document laid the groundwork for a sovereign democratic republic,
aspiring to uphold liberty, equality, and fraternity.
However,
as B.R. Ambedkar’s prophetic remarks during his closing address
to the Constituent Assembly in November 1949 remind us,
this journey has been fraught with challenges.
Indian Federalism: Features, Contemporary Challenges and Resilience Shown
The Unique Nature of Indian Federalism
India’s federal structure is
distinct, designed to accommodate its diverse socio-cultural and historical realities.
Unlike classical federations,
India operates on a ‘quasi-federal’ model that blends unitary and federal characteristics.
flexibility has enabled the country to address regional aspirations while maintaining national unity,
but the relationship between the Union and States has often been fraught with challenges.
The Role of State Governors: A Source of Tension
, expected to act as neutral arbiters,
have often been perceived as partisan agents of the Union government.
has led to legal disputes and strained centre-state relations,
particularly in politically sensitive contexts.
Recent Supreme Court rulings have sought to reaffirm the constitutional mandate of neutrality,
strengthening the federal character of the Indian system.
Simultaneous Elections: A Contentious Proposal
idea of holding simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies has sparked significant debate.
Proponents argue that it would reduce costs and administrative disruptions, while
critics caution that it could centralise power and overshadow state-specific issues.
This proposal underscores the tension between efficiency and the preservation of regional autonomy.
Linguistic Diversity and Federal Challenges
India’s linguistic diversity poses unique challenges to its federal structure.
The marginalisation of regional languages
like Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, and Marathi
has fuelled demands for greater linguistic equality.
Perceptions of Hindi imposition have led to protests
, emphasising the need for policies that respect multilingualism while fostering national unity.
Fiscal Federalism: Balancing Resource Distribution
Fiscal arrangements
under the Finance Commission and GST regime
have been a contentious issue,
with States often arguing that the system disproportionately favours the Union.
Delayed GST compensation payments
, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, have highlighted the vulnerabilities of the current fiscal framework and the need for reforms to ensure equitable resource distribution.
Delimitation Exercise: A Test of Federal Harmony
upcoming delimitation exercise to redraw parliamentary constituencies based on population data poses a significant challenge.
States with successful population control measures fear losing political representation,
creating a conflict between policy success and equitable representation.
issue exemplifies the complexities of India’s federal system.
The Resilience of Indian Federalism
Despite these challenges,
federalism remains a cornerstone of India’s democracy.
B.R. Ambedkar’s vision of co-equal powers between the Union and States emphasises the need for mutual respect and cooperation.
Judicial interpretations, such as the S.R. Bommai vs Union of India case, have reinforced federalism as part of the Constitution’s basic structure
, ensuring its continued relevance in India’s governance.
The Issue of Unequal Democracy: The Challenge of Social and Economic Justice
Legal and Institutional Challenges to Liberty
Critics argue that India is increasingly veering towards becoming a police state, with stringent laws and practices that stifle dissent and curtail individual freedoms.
Laws such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) have been criticised for their overreach
, vague definitions, and potential for misuse.
These statutes
, alongside the retention of colonial-era laws like sedition,
are seen as tools to suppress political opposition and curtail freedom of speech.
While these measures are often justified in the name of national security,
their application has raised concerns about eroding democratic liberties
and violating constitutional guarantees.
Caste and Social Inequalities: A Persistent Challenge
One of the most enduring social issues in India is
caste-based inequality, which continues to dominate the social and economic landscape.
Despite constitutional safeguards such as the abolition of untouchability and affirmative action policies,
caste still plays a significant role in determining access to education, employment, and social mobility.
intersections of caste, class, and gender exacerbate inequalities, leaving marginalised communities with limited opportunities
to break free from systemic oppression.
persistence of caste-based discrimination and violence indicates that India is far from achieving the vision of an egalitarian society.
Economic Inequalities: The Growing Divide
India’s economic growth over the past few decades has been remarkable
, but the benefits of this growth have not been evenly distributed.
gap between the rich and poor has widened,
with wealth concentrated in the hands of a few. Rural-urban disparities,
unequal access to quality education and healthcare, and limited opportunities for upward mobility further deepen economic inequalities.
Gender Inequality: A Barrier to Social Justice
Another critical dimension of inequality is
gender disparity
, which continues to limit women’s participation in political, economic, and social spheres.
Despite constitutional provisions ensuring equal rights,
women in India face systemic challenges such as wage gaps, underrepresentation in leadership roles
, and gender-based violence.
struggle for gender equality is further complicated by cultural and social norms that perpetuate patriarchal attitudes,
often rendering progressive legal frameworks ineffective in practice.
The Way Forward: Preserving the Constitution
Of late,
there has been some noise about revamping the Constitution
, as the
accusation is that it has evolved from a European colonial perspective.
It has become a common trope to suggest replacement of the present-day Constitution
with an ‘
Indic’ constitutional
Rather than dismantling the existing framework
, the need of the hour is to protect and strengthen the constitution.
Ambedkar’s call to defend democratic principles and preserve the Constitution is more relevant than ever.
India requires a new generation of constitutional guardians
, judges, bureaucrats, politicians, activists, journalists, and citizens,
who prioritise the nation over personal or sectarian interests.
These guardians must uphold the Constitution’s vision,
ensuring that governance reflects the ideals of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.
Conclusion
The 75th anniversary of India’s Constitution is a moment to celebrate its achievements
and confront its challenges.
Constitution has provided a robust framework for India’s democratic evolution, but its promise remains incomplete
without addressing the deep-seated inequalities that persist in society.
As the nation looks to the future, it must heed Ambedkar’s vision,
creating a sense of fraternity and safeguarding democratic principles.

**********Clamour for death penalty for R G Kar convict is self-defeating
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Debate on Death Penalty;
Why in the News?
A Kolkata court sentenced Sanjay Roy to life imprisonment for the rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor in August 2024, despite widespread public demand for the death penalty.
What are the current statistics around the Death Penalty in India?
As of the
Annual Statistics Report 2023
, 561 prisoners are under a sentence of death in India.
Despite the significant number of death sentences, India sees more than
31,000 reported rape cases annually
, indicating a mismatch between the deterrent effect of capital punishment and the reality of crime rates.
The
in India is often seen as disproportionately applied to the poor and marginalized sections of society.
What are the key arguments around the Death Penalty (For/Against)?
The arguments in favour of the death Penalty:
Retribution and Justice
: Supporters argue that the death penalty serves as a just punishment for the “rarest of rare” cases, especially for heinous crimes like rape and murder. The desire for justice for victims and their families, including a sense of closure, is often emphasized.
Deterrence
: Some proponents believe that the death penalty deters heinous crimes, particularly acts of violence like murder and rape, by instilling fear of the ultimate punishment.
Public Sentiment
: In the case of particularly gruesome crimes, public outcry demands strong actions like the death penalty, seeing it as a symbol of societal moral condemnation.
The arguments against the death penalty:
Moral and Existential Arguments
: The death penalty is viewed as an act of violence, and critics argue that one form of violence cannot be justified as a solution for other forms of violence. It is considered inhumane and degrading by organizations like Amnesty International.
Ineffectiveness as a Deterrent
: Studies from countries that have abolished the death penalty (e.g., Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands) show no significant rise in crime rates, indicating that the death penalty does not effectively deter crime more than life imprisonment or other punishments.
Disproportionate Application
: The death penalty is disproportionately applied to the poor, marginalized, and downtrodden, as opposed to affluent or powerful individuals, raising concerns about systemic injustice.
Diverts Focus from Structural Issues
: Instead of focusing on capital punishment, critics argue the real issue lies in the cultural normalization of violence and toxic masculinity, which drives crimes like rape and murder. Emphasis should be on education, socialization, and cultural transformation.
What are the key reforms and guidelines established after the Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab Case?
Rarest of Rare Doctrine
: The Supreme Court, in
, ruled that the death penalty should only be imposed in the “rarest of rare” cases. This ruling set a framework for judicial discretion in sentencing, ensuring that the death penalty is applied only in cases where the crime is so grave that life imprisonment would not suffice.
Guidelines for Sentencing
: The court sets guidelines to determine whether a crime warrants the death penalty, including the nature of the crime, the circumstances, and whether the accused is beyond reform or rehabilitation. It emphasized considering the “mitigating factors,” such as the background of the accused.
Judicial Review
: The ruling clarified that the death sentence must be subject to judicial review and that higher courts must ensure that the death penalty is only handed out after thorough deliberation on all aspects of the case.
Focus on Rehabilitation
: The case pointed towards the importance of rehabilitation, requiring courts to assess the potential for the accused to reform before considering a death sentence.
Way forward:
Strengthening Judicial Scrutiny and Transparency
: To ensure the death penalty is applied fairly and consistently, there should be enhanced judicial oversight which includes a thorough review of sentencing decisions at multiple levels.
This could involve greater emphasis on mitigating factors and the potential for rehabilitation, ensuring that capital punishment is reserved for the “rarest of rare” cases.
Focus on Preventive Measures and Social Reform
: Rather than relying solely on the death penalty, efforts should be redirected toward addressing the root causes of heinous crimes.
This includes tackling societal issues such as gender inequality, toxic masculinity, and cultural normalization of violence, while investing in education, social reform, and stronger support systems for survivors of violence.
Mains PYQ:
Instances of President’s delay in commuting death sentences has come under public debate as denial of justice. Should there be a time specified for the President to accept/rejectsuch petitions? Analyse.

**********Foundational values, the journey of the Indian state
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Constitutional values;
Why in the News?
As we mark 75 years since the Constitution of India came into effect, it’s important to look back and assess how the country has followed its core values before deciding the way forward.
What are the foundational values that define the Indian state?
Sovereignty, Democracy, and Republic
: The Constitution of India guarantees the sovereignty of the nation and democratic governance by the people through elected representatives.
Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity
: These values are enshrined in the Preamble and reflect the commitment to social democracy.
Justice
: Social, economic, and political justice is emphasized to create an inclusive society.
Federalism
: Though not explicitly mentioned, federalism underpins the constitutional framework, balancing powers between the Union and States.
Secularism
: Ensures the separation of religion and state, guaranteeing religious freedom and equality.
Rule of Law
: Establishes the supremacy of the Constitution and equality before the law.
Unity in Diversity
: Encourages harmony and fraternity among diverse cultural, linguistic, and regional groups.
How have recent legislative and political changes impacted India’s commitment to these values?
Secularism:
India’s constitutional commitment to secularism has been challenged by the laws related to religious identity.
Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019
, which provides citizenship to persecuted religious minorities from neighboring countries but excludes Muslims, has raised concerns about violating
Article 14 (Right to Equality)
and the secular ethos of the Constitution.
Social Justice:
The push for affirmative action through reservations continues, but new measures have sparked debates about inclusivity.
The introduction of the
Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) reservation
(103rd Constitutional Amendment) raised debates over its exclusion of marginalized communities already under the SC/ST/OBC reservation framework, potentially diluting the focus on caste-based historical injustices.
Federalism:
Legislative changes have altered the balance between the Union and states, raising concerns about cooperative federalism.
The abrogation of
Article 370
in Jammu and Kashmir and its reorganization into Union Territories in 2019 was criticized for bypassing the state legislature, raising questions about federalism under Article 1 and Article 370.
Freedom of Speech and Expression:
Political changes have led to an environment where dissent and criticism of the government are often met with punitive action.
The use of sedition laws under Section 124A of the IPC and the
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA)
against journalists and activists has raised concerns about stifling democratic dissent.
Inclusive Development:
Legislative efforts to boost development have sometimes led to neglect of environmental sustainability and marginalized communities.
Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006
, intended to protect the rights of tribal communities, has faced dilution through recent amendments to environmental laws, prioritizing infrastructure over community rights.
Equality and Gender Justice:
Legislative progress has been seen, but gaps remain in implementation.
Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018
, which introduced stringent punishment for crimes against women, shows legislative intent. However, underreporting and delayed justice continue to challenge gender equality.
What steps can be taken to reinforce India’s foundational values moving forward? (Way forward)

The
Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP),
an initiative of the
World Economic Forum,
has reached a significant milestone by expanding its network to include 25 countries.  This expansion introduces seven new members:
Angola, Bangladesh, Gabon, Guatemala, Kenya, Senegal,
Tanzania
, which together represent a population of more than 1.5 billion people.
What is the Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP)?
is an initiative launched by the
aimed at combating plastic pollution worldwide.
It focuses on promoting a circular economy for plastics, emphasizing reuse, recycling, and sustainable management to mitigate the environmental impacts of plastic waste.
What are the key components of GPAP?
Governance and Structure
: GPAP operates through a robust governance framework consisting of a Governing Council, Steering Board, and Advisory Committee, involving senior executives from founding organisations such as the World Economic Forum.
For example, in Indonesia, the governance structure facilitated the creation of the National Plastic Action Partnership (NPAP), which oversees the implementation of strategies to reduce marine plastic leakage.
National Action Roadmaps
: GPAP collaborates with various stakeholders to create National Action Roadmaps tailored to specific countries.
For instance, Vietnam’s National Plastic Action Partnership launched its roadmap in 2022, targeting a 50% reduction in plastic waste by 2030 through strategies.
Investment Mobilization
: GPAP focuses on aligning financial resources with plastic waste reduction goals. For example, in Ghana, GPAP worked with the government and private sector to attract investments for waste recycling infrastructure.
Global Collaboration Network
: GPAP acts as a platform connecting stakeholders globally to address plastic pollution.
For example, it facilitated the sharing of best practices between countries like Indonesia and Ghana, allowing them to adopt innovative solutions such as advanced recycling technologies and extended producer responsibility (EPR) frameworks.
What is the significance of expanding GPAP to include seven new African countries?
Strengthened Global Coalition:
With this expansion, GPAP now encompasses 25 countries representing over 1.5 billion people, making it the largest global initiative focused on combating plastic pollution.
Addressing Urgent Environmental Challenges:
The inclusion of these countries underscores a growing recognition of the urgent need to tackle plastic pollution, which poses severe threats to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human health.
Fostering Regional Collaboration:
The addition of new African countries facilitates regional collaboration and knowledge sharing on best practices for waste management and recycling.
Economic Growth and Job Creation:
GPAP’s initiatives are expected to stimulate economic growth through the promotion of sustainable materials and recycling infrastructure.
Commitment to Circular Economy Principles:
The expansion reflects a commitment to advancing circular economy principles, which focus on reusing and recycling plastics rather than relying on single-use materials.
What are the anticipated environmental and economic impacts of GPAP’s initiatives?
Decreased Greenhouse Gas Emissions:
The initiative targets a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions associated with plastic production and waste management, which currently accounts for an estimated 1.8 billion tonnes annually. By promoting a circular economy, GPAP aims to mitigate emissions, particularly methane from landfills.
By implementing
, the partnership seeks to reduce annual land-based plastic leakage by approximately 80% by 2040 compared to business-as-usual scenarios.
By transitioning to a
circular economy model,
GPAP initiatives can help countries recover lost economic value from plastics, estimated at $80 billion to $120 billion annually due to inefficiencies in current systems.
GPAP’s efforts in developing sustainable waste management practices are expected to create significant employment opportunities, potentially generating up to 6 million green jobs globally
. This includes safer jobs for informal waste workers who play a crucial role in recycling and waste management.
Investment Mobilization:
The partnership has already mobilized substantial investments, such as $3.1 billion, aimed at supporting projects that tackle plastic waste. This influx of capital can stimulate local economies and drive innovation in sustainable materials and recycling technologies.
Way forward:
Strengthen Policy Frameworks and Partnerships
: Collaborate with governments, private sectors, and civil society to establish robust policies to enforce regulations and promote extended producer responsibility (EPR) frameworks to drive systemic change.
Enhance Innovation and Infrastructure
: Invest in advanced recycling technologies for scalable waste management infrastructure and research to develop sustainable alternatives, fostering a circular economy while creating green jobs and reducing plastic pollution.
