**********Ghaggar River
A joint committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has found that the Ghaggar River water contained from two to three times the prescribed limit of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), making it unfit for outdoor bathing.
About Ghaggar River:
The Ghaggar River is an
intermittent river
that flows in India and Pakistan (Hakra).
The river flows
only during the monsoon season
It
originates in the Shivalik Hills of Himachal Pradesh
and flows through
Haryana and Rajasthan
before disappearing into the Thar Desert.
This seasonal river feeds
two irrigation canals
that extend into Rajasthan.
The Hakra, which flows in Pakistan, is the continuation of the Ghaggar River in India, and they are together called
the Ghaggar-Hakra River
Historical Significance:
Several historians identify Ghaggar with the Vedic Saraswati River.
Along the banks of the Ghaggar River, many settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization have been excavated.
It is believed that the rivers Sutlej and Yamuna once flowed into the Ghaggar-Hakra river bed.
Tributaries:
The main tributaries of the Ghaggar are the
Kaushalya, Markanda, Sarsuti, Tangri and Chautang.

**********RNA Therapy
In recent days RNA-based precision therapeutics are emerging as a game-changer for genetic disorders, including inherited retinal diseases (IRDs).
About RNA Therapy:
It is a term used to describe the use of
RNA-based molecules
to modulate biological pathways to cure a specific condition.
Unlike gene-editing therapies, RNA-based therapies
offer a safer alternative
as they make temporary changes that
do not carry over to future generations
, reducing the risk of unintended long-term effects.
Applications of RNA based Therapies:
RNA-editing with ADAR enzymes:
It can correct specific genetic mutations at the RNA level. This method has the potential to
restore protein production in retinal cells
without altering the underlying DNA, offering a new way to treat retinal degenerative diseases caused by single-point mutations.
Using of suppressor tRNAs:
It is to bypass
stop-codon mutations
, which can prematurely halt protein synthesis in retinal cells. By enabling the production of full-length proteins, this approach could help restore proper retinal function in IRD patients.
PTC124 Method:
It is also
known as ataluren,
which is already being used to treat patients with
cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)
have already been used successfully to treat diseases such as
spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

**********India-China diplomatic thaw
Why in news?
India and China have taken significant steps to improve their bilateral relations, including resuming the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra this summer, restoring direct flights, issuing visas for journalists and think tanks, and sharing trans-border river data.
These decisions followed a meeting between India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Chinese officials.
What’s in today’s article?
Fine print of India - China statements
Analysis
On the framing of the meeting
India's Framing of the Meeting
India’s statement emphasized the review of the overall state of India-China bilateral relations, with a focus on people-centric steps to stabilize and rebuild ties.
India highlighted the agreed actions from the previous meeting between PM Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan, conveying a cautious and nuanced approach to the discussions.
China's Framing of the Meeting
China, on the other hand, framed the discussions as being focused on the improvement and development of bilateral relations, noting that the two sides reached a consensus on specific measures.
Beijing presented a more optimistic assessment of the talks, with a focus on progress and forward-looking outcomes.
The statements from both India and China are similar regarding the
resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra
, but the Chinese statement reflects more urgency, specifying it will happen "
as soon as possible
."
India stated that the yatra will resume in
summer 2025
, with discussions on modalities taking place as per existing agreements.
China, however, mentioned the visit would be to the
Xizang Autonomous Region
and emphasized that discussions on arrangements would be initiated quickly.
Direct Flights
India and China also agreed in principle to resume direct flights, but with slight differences in emphasis.
India’s statement highlighted the need for a new pact and for technical authorities from both sides to meet and negotiate an updated framework.
China’s statement, meanwhile, connected the resumption of flights with facilitating personnel flows and exchanges of resident journalists.
Before the flights were suspended due to the pandemic and the Galwan clash in 2020, the two countries had 539 direct flights per month, with a total seat capacity of over 1.25 lakh.
Currently, India has only one resident journalist in China, while China has none.
Trans-Border River Cooperation
India and China have agreed to hold an
early meeting
India-China Expert Level Mechanism
to discuss issues related to
trans-border rivers
, including the sharing of hydrological data.
This follows concerns raised by India about China’s construction of the world’s largest dam on the
Brahmaputra
River, which was cleared in January.
India stated that the meeting would focus on the
resumption of hydrological data provision
and other forms of cooperation concerning trans-border rivers.
China, similarly, emphasized the advancement of
trans-border river cooperation
and maintaining communication for an early meeting of the Expert Level Mechanism.
India's Approach
India advocated for a
step-by-step approach
to address areas of mutual
interest
, particularly focusing on the
border situation
The Indian statement highlighted the resumption of existing dialogues, agreeing to take a gradual approach in addressing each side’s priorities through these mechanisms.
China's Approach
China maintained its
long-term strategy
for handling bilateral relations, emphasizing that both sides should view and manage relations based on the
fundamental interests
of their countries and peoples.
The Chinese statement stressed the importance of advancing exchanges and practical cooperation with a
constructive attitude
, while enhancing
mutual trust
and managing differences.
China called for promoting relations along a
sound and stable track
from a
strategic and long-term perspective
Trade Concerns
India raised specific concerns regarding market access and discussed the need for policy transparency and predictability in economic and trade areas.
However, the Chinese statement did not address these concerns, leaving the issue unmentioned on their side.
Support for SCO Presidency
China mentioned that India would extend full support for China’s presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and actively participate in the meetings under the SCO umbrella.
In contrast, India did not comment on this aspect in its statement.
Differing Views on Mutual Relations
China emphasized the importance of avoiding mutual suspicion, estrangement, and exhaustion in relations between the two countries.
This framing contrasts with India’s approach, as outlined by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who has described India’s approach as focusing on mutual respect, mutual sensitivity, and mutual interests.
The differences in these three mutuals reflect divergent perspectives on the nature of their relationship.

**********Reevaluating India’s Trade Policy - Budget Announcements, Tariff Strategies, and Global Integration
Context:
While the Union Budget is not the primary forum for trade-related announcements, it has become an important medium to communicate India’s global economic policy.
The upcoming budget is expected to address trade deficits, currency stability, and export promotion.
However, questions arise regarding the
frequent policy changes
and their
impact on India’s external trade objectives.
Challenges with Frequent Tariff Adjustments:
Policy instability:
Frequent changes in customs duties create uncertainty and hinder investment and trade expansion.
Example of mobile phone components:
The fluctuating tariffs on lenses, Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBAs), and chargers demonstrate inconsistency in trade policies, negatively impacting manufacturers.
Impact on exports and FDI:
Instability in trade policy discourages foreign investment and stagnates India’s export growth, which remains at around 2% of global exports.
The Need for Comprehensive Trade Policy Reform:
Lowering tariffs alone is insufficient:
Trade reforms should go beyond tariff reductions to ensure long-term consistency.
Policy consistency:
A dedicated committee should be established to draft and maintain a stable trade policy.
India’s Trade Agreements dilemma:
The government remains hesitant to join global trade blocs like RCEP and CPTPP due to concerns about trade deficits and protecting domestic industries.
RCEP vs CPTPP:
RCEP:
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. It is a free trade agreement between 15 Asia-Pacific countries, signed in November 2020 and came into effect on January 1, 2022.
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. It is a free trade agreement between Canada and 10 other countries in the Indo-Pacific.
Some difference between RCEP and CPTPP:
CPTPP has an
Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS)
provision, which allows foreign investors to sue states in international arbitration tribunals. RCEP does not have an ISDS provision.
CPTPP includes provisions for
labor issues and environmental protections
, while RCEP does not.
Reevaluating Trade Agreements - RCEP vs CPTPP:
Impact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs):
India’s trade deficit is often driven by intermediate goods imports, which improve domestic manufacturing.
Growth in finished goods exports:
Despite concerns, India has maintained a surplus in finished goods trade with ASEAN countries.
Simulation analysis:
RCEP risks:
Heavily dominated by China, RCEP could exacerbate India’s trade deficit.
CPTPP benefits:
With the exclusion of both the US and China, CPTPP offers a more balanced trade environment, potential for export growth, and alignment with India’s long-term economic goals.
The Way Forward:
Trade openness alone is not enough:
Structural reforms must accompany trade liberalization to address domestic inefficiencies.
Reevaluation of trade pessimism:
India must base its trade policy on informed discourse rather than nationalistic narratives.
Strategic engagement with Global Value Chains (GVCs):
A well-thought-out trade policy can help India achieve its ambitious export target of $2 trillion by 2030.
Conclusion:
India’s trade policy needs a shift from protectionism to strategic global integration.
A stable and well-structured trade approach, supported by long-term policy consistency, will enhance India’s competitiveness in the global market.

**********The Copyright Conundrum in Carnatic Music
Context
Carnatic music,
an ancient and revered form of Indian classical music,
has long existed outside the strict boundaries of copyright law.
This
exclusion is due to both historical factors and the unique nature of Carnatic music
, which emphasises improvisation and oral tradition.
However,
as the recent Margazhi music season
in Chennai demonstrated,
copyright concerns are becoming increasingly relevant.
existing legal framework does not adequately protect performers
, raising pressing questions about whether the law should evolve to reflect the realities of Indian classical music.
The Legal Dilemma: Copyright and Carnatic Music
A Unique Dilemma
relationship between copyright law and Carnatic music presents a unique dilemma that stems from the nature of classical compositions,
the role of improvisation, and the historical context of Indian copyright legislation.
Unlike Western classical music, which relies heavily on written scores,
Carnatic music is primarily an oral tradition, passed down from teacher to student
over generations.
fundamental difference raises complex legal questions
about how intellectual property rights should apply to an art form that thrives on fluidity and creative reinterpretation.
The Western Influence on Indian Copyright Law
Copyright law in India, originally enacted in 1914
during British rule, was influenced by Western legal frameworks, particularly British copyright law.
legislation, which was revised in 1957, continued to operate under the assumption that music is a composition
that can be reduced to written notation.
perspective is aligned with the Western classical tradition
, where composers write detailed scores specifying every note, dynamic, and articulation.
role of a performer in Western classical music is often to faithfully interpret these compositions
rather than to improvise or innovate.
The Challenges of Implementation of Copyright Law in Carnatic Music
Carnatic music, by contrast, does not function in the same way
, while written notation exists, it serves only as a skeletal framework for a composition.
essence of Carnatic music lies in its improvisatory aspects
, manodharma sangeetam, which includes raga alapana (melodic improvisation), neraval (improvised elaboration of a phrase), and kalpana swaras (spontaneous note sequences).
Because these elements are not fixed in writing
they do not fit neatly into the legal definition
of a ‘musical work’ under copyright law.
This raises the fundamental question:
Should copyright law define music based on a Western understanding, or should it evolve to accommodate non-Western traditions like Carnatic music?
The Public Domain and the Question of Improvisation
One of the major reasons Carnatic music has remained outside mainstream copyright discussions is that
most of its foundational compositions belong to the public domain.
works of composers such as Tyagaraja, Purandara Dasa, and Gopalakrishna Bharati were created before copyright laws existed,
meaning their compositions are freely available for anyone to perform.
Carnatic musicians do not merely reproduce these compositions—they reinterpret them,
often introducing complex improvisations and personal stylistic touches.
These additions, while artistically significant, do not currently receive copyright protection
. This leads to several critical legal questions:
If a musician improvises a section of a song,
does that improvisation qualify as a new, copyrightable work?
If a performer reinterprets a composition
by changing its raga or tempo, should they have rights over that specific rendition?
Should a performer’s unique style
, such as Madurai Mani Iyer’s distinctive approach to
Eppo Varuvaro, be considered an intellectual property right?
Existing Copyright Protections and Their Limitations
Composer and Lyricist Rights
composer and lyricist of a song receive copyright protection for their lifetime plus 60 years.
ensures that their work cannot be commercially exploited
without permission.
in the case of Carnatic music, most compositions by great composers
like Tyagaraja, Muddusvami Dikshitar, and Shyama Shastri
are already in the public domain,
meaning anyone can perform
or record them without seeking permission.
Mechanical Rights (Rights Over Sound Recordings)
When a song is recorded onto a tangible medium,
such as an audio CD or a digital file,
the entity that records the song (such as a record label or an individual artist) gains mechanical rights
over that specific recording for 60 years.
While this provides some form of protection, it does not extend to live performances
where improvisation plays a significant role.
Performers' Rights
Performers, including singers and instrumentalists
, have the
right to prevent unauthorised recordings of their performances.
This is particularly relevant for live concerts, where artists might not wish their music to be recorded and distributed without consent.
In theory,
performers should also be entitled to royalties from streams or sales of their music.
The Need for Legal Reform
spontaneous nature of Carnatic improvisation complicates its protection
under existing copyright laws.
Unlike compositions that are formally documented,
improvisations are often ephemeral, making it difficult to claim ownership.
Yet,
the contributions of performers should not be overlooked
. Musicians should have the right to commercially benefit from their unique interpretations, just as composers and lyricists do.
Necessary Measures Towards a More Inclusive Framework
Recognising Improvisation as Intellectual Property
: Laws should account for original variations and improvisations in a performance, granting musicians limited rights over their unique contributions.
Stronger Performers’ Rights
Existing laws on performers’ rights should be enforced,
ensuring that artists can control and monetise recordings of their concerts.
Unauthorised uploads to streaming platforms should be subject to stricter penalties.
Fair Royalty Distribution
Streaming services and concert venues
should be required to compensate artists for performances.
The royalty flow from digital platforms should be strengthened,
ensuring that musicians benefit financially from their work.
Conclusion
The current copyright framework in India does not reflect the realities of Carnatic music
, leaving performers vulnerable to exploitation.
While classical compositions are in the public domain,
the creativity infused into their rendition deserves recognition and protection.
Instead of forcing music to fit outdated legal definitions,
copyright law should evolve to safeguard the rights of musicians.
By reforming copyright laws
to include improvisation and strengthening performers' rights,
India can ensure that Carnatic musicians receive the recognition and financial security
they deserve.

hat milk consumption is linked to improved child growth outcomes, reducing the risks of stunting, underweight, and other anthropometric failures
among children aged six months to five years.
Despite these benefits,
access to milk remains highly inequitable, with significant disparities based on income, geography, and social background.
The Extent of Inequality in Milk Consumption and the Challenges in Ensuring Equitable Access
Income-Based Disparities
According to the latest
Household Consumer Expenditure Surveys (HCES)
conducted by the
National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)
, households in the top income decile (the richest 10%) consume
three to four times more milk per capita
than those in the lowest-income decile (the poorest 10%).
While consumption has increased among lower-income groups, this growth has not been sufficient to bridge the gap.
poorest 30% of Indian households
account for only
18% of total milk consumption
, despite making up a much larger share of the population.
Wealthier households not only consume more milk but also have access to
value-added dairy products
like cheese, flavoured milk, and packaged dairy sweets.
For low-income households, the high cost of milk forces them to
prioritise more affordable calorie-dense foods
, often leading to poor nutrition.
Although India has a robust dairy industry, the affordability gap means that even though milk is widely produced, it does not necessarily reach those who need it most.
Urban-Rural Divide
India’s milk production is largely concentrated in
rural areas
, yet paradoxically,
urban households consume about 30% more milk per capita than rural households
Higher purchasing power
in urban areas allows for greater consumption of milk and dairy products.
presence of organised retail chains and supermarkets
in cities provides easier access to processed and packaged milk.
Urban diets are more diverse, and milk is often included in multiple forms, such as coffee, tea, milkshakes, and yogurt-based products.
In contrast, rural populations—despite producing most of India’s milk—consume less due to
lower incomes, traditional dietary habits, and limited access to refrigeration
Regional Disparities
Milk consumption varies drastically across different states, reflecting regional differences in dietary preferences, economic conditions, and dairy industry development.
Northern and Western states (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Gujarat)
333 to 421 grams of milk per capita daily
at home.
These regions have a strong dairy culture, with milk being a staple in their diets.
Eastern states (Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and West Bengal)
consume only
75 to 171 grams per capita daily
, much lower than the recommended levels.
Dairy consumption is lower in these states due to factors such as dietary traditions, economic constraints, and weaker dairy supply chains.
States with strong dairy cooperative movements, such as Gujarat (home to Amul), have
higher per capita milk consumption
, whereas states with weaker dairy infrastructures struggle with accessibility and affordability.
Social and Cultural Disparities
Scheduled Tribe (ST) households consume
four litres less milk per capita per month
than General Category households.
Many ST communities
belong to lower-income groups,
making milk a luxury rather than a dietary staple.
Certain communities historically rely more on plant-based diets
, with milk playing a lesser role in their nutrition.
Many ST populations live in remote areas
with poor market infrastructure,
making regular milk consumption challenging.
Out-of-Home Consumption and Underreporting
NSSO Household Consumer Expenditure Surveys
mainly capture
at-home consumption
, but this does not represent total milk consumption.
Approximately
50% of India’s total milk production is consumed outside the home
, in forms such as:
Tea and coffee sold in restaurants, tea stalls, and roadside vendors.
Dairy-based sweets like rasgulla, gulab jamun, and paneer dishes consumed in eateries.
Packaged dairy drinks and flavoured milk products purchased from supermarkets.
This
underreporting of out-of-home consumption
likely
worsens the perception of inequities
because wealthier individuals, who dine out more frequently, are not fully accounted for in consumption surveys.
Policy Interventions for Equitable Milk Distribution
Enhancing Milk Access in Government Nutrition Programs
Government schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman (
POSHAN
) program and the Integrated Child Development Services (
ICDS
should integrate milk provisions to improve nutrition for children and mothers.
While states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, and Telangana have already implemented milk distribution in such programs,
existing allocations remain insufficient.
Additionally,
some states, such as Chhattisgarh
have discontinued milk provisions due to financial constraints.
Increased budgetary allocations
and innovative funding mechanisms, such as social bonds and corporate social responsibility (
CSR
) initiatives,
could help sustain and expand these programs.
Leveraging Dairy Markets for Targeted Support
In areas with strong dairy cooperative networks,
governments could introduce milk coupons for low-income households.
This would enhance access while simultaneously supporting local dairy producers
and reducing distribution costs.
Raising Awareness About Nutrition and Equitable Consumption
Awareness campaigns should emphasise the health benefits of milk
while addressing consumption imbalances.
Grassroots initiatives, such as Maharashtra and Bihar’s campaigns
during Poshan Maah 2024,
demonstrate how targeted education can improve dietary diversity.
Outreach efforts through Anganwadi centres, self-help groups
, and healthcare providers
can further enhance nutrition literacy among women
, who play a crucial role in household food decisions.
Encouraging Balanced Consumption Among Affluent Groups: Lesson from the UK
While addressing undernutrition is vital,
overconsumption of high-fat dairy products among wealthy households must also be curbed.
Inspired by the United Kingdom’s Change4Life Sugar Swaps campaign,
India could implement
similar public health initiatives to promote balanced dairy consumption.
Collaborations with doctors, influencers, and media campaigns
could help shift consumer behaviour,
making milk more affordable and accessible
for vulnerable populations.
Conclusion
India’s milk revolution has undoubtedly been a success in terms of production
, but equitable access remains an urgent challenge.
Addressing consumption disparities
through policy interventions, targeted subsidies, awareness campaigns, and innovative financing
will ensure that milk benefits all sections of society.
By prioritising vulnerable populations while promoting balanced consumption
among affluent groups,
India can fulfil Verghese Kurien’s vision of a nutritionally secure nation

**********[30th January 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Bridge the milk divide for a nutritionally secure India
Indian Society
PYQ Relevance:
Q.)
How far do you agree with the view that the focus on the lack of availability of food as the main cause of hunger takes the attention away from ineffective human development policies in India? (
CS Mains 2018
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC Mains has always focused on the
main cause of hunger (2018)
and
poverty and hunger in India
(2019).
India’s White Revolution made it the world’s top milk producer, but now the focus should shift to ensuring milk reaches the most vulnerable. Milk is an important source of protein and calcium, especially for children. However, there are significant differences in milk consumption across income groups and regions. Addressing these gaps is crucial for better health outcomes.
Today’s editorial discusses how milk should be accessible to everyone in India and highlights the differences in milk availability. It looks at how these issues are connected to topics in GS Paper 1, 2, and 3, such as social inequalities, health, and policy solutions.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
The challenge is making sure that the most vulnerable people have fair access to milk, while also controlling how much milk is consumed by wealthier people.
What is the disparity in milk consumption?
Income-Based Disparities
: Households in the top-income decile consume 3-4 times more milk per capita compared to those in the lowest-income decile. Despite increases in milk consumption among lower-income groups, the poorest 30% account for just 18% of India’s milk.
Urban vs. Rural and Regional Disparities
: Urban households consume ~30% more milk per capita than rural households, despite rural areas being the main milk producers.
Additionally, northern states like
Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana
have higher consumption (333g-421g), while eastern states like Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and West Bengal have much lower consumption (75g-171g).
Social Group Disparities
: Scheduled Tribe households consume 4 litres less milk per capita annually compared to general category households, highlighting social and economic inequalities in milk access.
What are the nutritional implications of milk consumption in India?
Protein Source:
Milk is a rich source of high-quality protein. In India, it contributes significantly to daily protein intake, especially for children and adults in rural areas. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), over 70% of children in India consume milk, making it a key protein source.
Calcium and Bone Health:
Milk provides essential calcium, which is vital for bone health. Around 67% of Indian households consume milk, helping to prevent calcium deficiency, particularly in growing children and elderly populations, which can lead to conditions like osteoporosis.
Micronutrients and Vitamin D:
Milk is also a good source of vitamins such as B12 and D, essential for immune function and energy production. The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) states that milk helps in reducing vitamin D deficiency, which is prevalent in India due to limited sunlight exposure.
How can policy interventions address disparities in milk production and access?
Enhancing Milk Provision:
Increase milk availability for vulnerable populations through government schemes like the
Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman (POSHAN)
Integrated Child Development Services.
States can collaborate with nutrition institutes to align milk products with local dietary preferences.
Financial Support:
Boost financial allocations for existing schemes to ensure adequate milk provision, especially in states where such programs have been discontinued due to budget constraints.
Nutritional Awareness Campaigns:
Conduct awareness campaigns focusing on the benefits of milk consumption, targeting women through various community channels. This can help improve dietary diversity within households.
What strategies can be implemented to promote sustainable dairy practices?
Healthy Consumption Awareness:
Develop partnerships with healthcare professionals and media to promote balanced diets and moderation in dairy consumption among affluent groups.
For example, Campaigns similar to the UK’s Change4Life initiative could serve as effective models for India.
Investing in Dairy Infrastructure:
The government should continue investing in dairy infrastructure, including animal health care and fodder availability, to ensure sustainable production practices while improving yields.
Community Engagement:
Engage local communities in sustainable practices through education and training programs aimed at improving animal husbandry practices and enhancing productivity without compromising environmental sustainability.
What are the steps taken by the government?
Rashtriya Gokul Mission:
This initiative focuses on enhancing the genetic quality of bovine animals through the identification and use of high-quality bulls for breeding, in-vitro fertilization (IVF) technology, and genomic selection. It aims to improve milk production by covering millions of livestock and providing better healthcare services for animals.
National Dairy Plan (NDP):
The NDP supports the establishment of dairy cooperatives and processing facilities to enhance milk marketing and value addition. It includes financial assistance for creating dairy processing infrastructure, thereby improving the overall efficiency and competitiveness of the dairy sector.
Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Facility:
This scheme offers credit support to farmers for various agricultural activities, including dairy farming. By providing financial assistance, the KCC aims to empower smallholder farmers to invest in their livestock and improve milk production capabilities.
Way forward:
Increase Access for Vulnerable Groups
: Expand milk distribution through government schemes (e.g., POSHAN and ICDS) and ensure adequate funding to cover vulnerable populations.
Regional and Social Equity
: Implement targeted interventions to reduce regional, income, and social disparities in milk access, such as milk coupons or subsidies for underserved areas.
**********How can the Budget arrest growth decline?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Indian Economy;
Why in the News?
The growth rate is lower than what the government had expected. Looking at past trends, the 2004-2011 period had high growth and poverty reduction, supported by welfare programs and government interventions.
Context:
World Bank
forecasts India’s GDP growth to soften to 6.5% for the fiscal year 2024-25, down from previous expectations of 7%. This reflects a slowdown in investment and weak manufacturing growth.
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
has also revised its growth forecast for India to 7% for FY24 and 6.5% for FY25, citing robust domestic demand but acknowledging challenges ahead
How did the period from 2004 to 2011 have a consistently high growth rate?
State Intervention and Welfare Programs:
This period saw a revival of state interventions through rights-based legislation and welfare schemes, which contributed to economic growth and reduced absolute poverty.
Notably, programs like the
National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)
provided jobs and set higher wage floors, benefiting the rural poor.
Rising Consumption Among Lower Income Groups:
Despite increasing income inequality, the consumption share of the
bottom 80%
of the population grew faster than that of the
richest 20%.
This was facilitated by targeted fiscal policies that favoured lower-income groups, enhancing their consumption capacity.
Increased Fiscal Expenditure on Social Services:
There was a significant rise in social services and developmental expenditures during this time, which directly impacted consumption patterns positively across various commodity categories for lower-income groups.
Does the nature of fiscal expenditure also matter when it comes to private consumption?
Capital Expenditure vs. Revenue Expenditure
Capital Expenditure (Capex)
(e.g., infrastructure projects) primarily benefits high-income groups and corporations, with a lower short-term impact on consumption.
(e.g., social welfare, wages, and pensions) immediately boosts demand by increasing disposable income among lower-income groups.
Leakages in Capex
: Large-scale projects often involve imports (e.g., heavy machinery), leading to capital outflows instead of stimulating the domestic economy.
Higher Consumption Propensity of Lower-Income Groups
: Money spent on welfare programs reaches people with a higher tendency to spend, leading to a larger multiplier effect on domestic demand.
How would an increase in revenue expenditure, particularly in the social sector, help? (Way forward)
Higher Incomes for Workers:
By providing better wages and job opportunities through social programs, disposable income among lower-income populations would rise, thereby boosting overall consumption levels.
Stimulating Private Investment:
Enhanced consumer demand can create a conducive environment for businesses to invest. As workers have more income to spend, businesses may respond by increasing production capacity, leading to a cycle of investment and growth
Reversing Economic Slowdown:
A strategic shift towards increasing revenue expenditure can help combat the current economic slowdown by fostering a more inclusive growth model that benefits a broader segment of society.
Mains PYQ:
“Industrial growth rate has lagged behind in the overall growth of Gross-Domestic-Product (GDP) in the post-reform period” Give reasons. How far the recent changes in Industrial Policy are capable of increasing the industrial growth rate?

**********Only a radical policy shift can lift farmers from widespread distress
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges in Agriculture;
Why in the News?
Agriculture has been given little attention, even though the
National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)
data shows that 1,00,474 farmers and agricultural workers took their own lives between 2015 and 2022.
What are the root causes of the current agrarian distress faced by farmers in India?
Unmet Minimum Support Price (MSP) Promise:
Despite repeated promises, the government has failed to implement the MSP at the rate of C2+50% (one-and-a-half times the comprehensive cost of production) as recommended by the M.S. Swaminathan Commission.
Rising Input Costs and Economic Burden:
The cost of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, insecticides, diesel, water, and electricity has been steadily rising.
Inadequate Government Support and Infrastructure:
Government allocations to agriculture and allied sectors have been declining, from 5.44% of the total budget in 2019 to just 3.15% in 2024.
At the same time, public investment in irrigation and power infrastructure has decreased, leading to water scarcity and unreliable electricity supply.
How can policy reforms effectively address the challenges faced by farmers?
Implementation of MSP:
Establishing a statutory MSP at C2+50% is essential to ensure that farmers receive fair compensation for their produce. This reform would help alleviate financial distress and reduce the incidence of farm suicides.
Subsidy Increases and Cost Controls:
The government should raise subsidies for agricultural inputs and impose strict controls on prices charged by private corporations for fertilizers and seeds. Supporting public sector production can help stabilize prices and ensure availability.
Comprehensive Loan Waiver:
A one-time loan waiver for farmers can provide immediate relief from debt burdens. This measure should be coupled with long-term strategies to prevent future indebtedness through better financial management and support systems.
What role do government support and institutional frameworks play in alleviating farmer distress?
Financial Assistance and Subsidies:
Government support through subsidies for fertilizers, seeds, and irrigation systems helps reduce the financial burden on farmers. For example, the
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)
provides direct income support to farmers, aiding those facing economic hardship.
Crop Insurance and Risk Mitigation:
Institutional frameworks such as the
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)
offer insurance schemes to protect farmers against crop losses due to natural disasters, thereby reducing the risk of distress when unforeseen events occur.
Market Access and Price Support:
The government ensures fair prices and stable markets through
and procurement schemes. The
Food Corporation of India (FCI)
buys surplus crops like wheat and rice from farmers at MSP, offering a safety net during market fluctuations.
Agricultural Credit and Loans:
Institutional frameworks like the NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) and other banks offer affordable loans to farmers, allowing them to invest in better farming techniques or recover from losses, thus mitigating financial stress.
Kisan Credit Cards (KCC)
provide short-term credit to meet the farmers’ needs for inputs and daily expenses.
Way forward:
Strengthen Infrastructure and Support Systems:
Invest in reliable irrigation, power supply, and crop insurance schemes, ensuring farmers have access to resources that help them cope with climate-related challenges and reduce dependency on private traders.
Enhance Financial Accessibility and Risk Management:
Expand access to affordable credit, implement statutory MSP at C2+50%, and provide better financial literacy programs to help farmers manage debts and reduce vulnerability to market fluctuations.

Why in the News?
A new study has revealed that over
7,500 lakes in western Greenland
brown, suffered water quality deterioration, and started emitting carbon
due to extreme weather events in
2022
.
About Greenland and Its Lakes
, the world’s largest island, is covered by a massive
ice sheet
that holds nearly
8% of the world’s freshwater
The island is home to
thousands of glacial-fed lakes
, which are
due to their pristine water quality and
low organic content
These lakes play a crucial role in
providing drinking water, supporting biodiversity, and storing atmospheric carbon

waterproof, grease-resistant,
non-stick properties
They are often called “
” because they do not break down easily in the environment or human body.
PFAS are commonly
found in non-stick cookware (Teflon),
waterproof clothing, food packaging, fire-fighting foams, and industrial applications.
These chemicals are known for their
high resistance to heat, water, and oil
, making them useful but also environmentally persistent.
Common Uses:
Non-stick cookware (Teflon), waterproof fabrics, stain-resistant coatings,
Industrial applications such as
metal plating, food packaging, and electronics manufacturing
Environmental and Health Concerns:
PFAS are often called
do not naturally degrade
and persist in
soil, water, and living organisms
Exposure to PFAS has been linked to
cancer, liver damage, immune system disruption, and hormonal imbalances
Regulatory Actions:
2023
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
designated PFOS (a type of PFAS) as a
hazardous substance
, requiring
strict monitoring and clean-up efforts
Governments worldwide are
phasing out PFAS use
and funding research into
bioremediation technologies
like the
F11 bacteria-based clean-up approach
In 2020, the
Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)
adopted international criteria for sampling and testing certain PFAS compounds, such as
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)
perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)
However, comprehensive policies to regulate or ban PFAS are still lacking.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Organophosphates
Why in the News?
A mysterious illness in Jammu & Kashmir has caused 17 deaths, with doctors suspecting organophosphate poisoning from pesticides as the possible cause.
What are Organophosphates?
Organophosphates (OPs)
are a class of
chemical compounds
primarily used as
pesticides and insecticides
in agriculture.
They work by
disrupting the nervous system
by inhibiting the enzyme
acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
, leading to excessive nerve stimulation.
It is commonly used in
agriculture, household pest control, and chemical warfare agents (e.g., nerve gases like Sarin).
It is found in
such as
malathion, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon
Effects of OP poisoning:
Acute Symptoms
: Excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle twitching, breathing difficulty, seizures, and coma.
Chronic Effects
: Neurological disorders, memory loss, muscle weakness, and reproductive toxicity.
Treatment for Organophosphate Poisoning
Organophosphate poisoning requires immediate medical attention to prevent fatal complications.
Decontamination
: Remove contaminated clothing, wash exposed skin, and use activated charcoal if ingested.
Medical Treatment:
Atropine
: Blocks excess nerve stimulation.
Pralidoxime
(2-PAM): Restores enzyme function.
Oxygen therapy
and ventilator support if needed.
Supportive Care
: IV fluids, anti-seizure medications, and hospitalization in severe cases.
