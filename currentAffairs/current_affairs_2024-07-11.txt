SC Upholds Maintainability Of West Bengal’s Suit Against CBI
Why in news?
The Supreme Court upheld the maintainability of a lawsuit filed by the State of West Bengal against the Union Government.  The suit accuses the Centre of "constitutional overreach" and violating federal principles by deploying the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the state without obtaining prior consent from the state government.
The Centre had argued that the Union government had no superintendence or control over the CBI.

About CBI
Consent Required by the CBI for Conducting Investigation in a State
Withdrawal of General Consent and its Impact
SC holds Bengal’s suit maintainable
About the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):
The CBI is the
premier investigating agency
of India operating under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions
, Government of India.
It traces its origin from
the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DPSE) Act, 1946,
which regulates the CBI.
As the DPSE Act is not passed by Parliament of India, CBI is created by an
executive order
of the government, hence
not a statutory body
yet and is exempted from the purview of the
Right to Information (RTI) Act.
Originally set up to
probe cases of corruption
in the government departments,
CBI’s jurisdiction expanded
to include several economic crimes, special crimes, cases of corruption and other cases.
Investigating powers of CBI are divided into:
Anti-Corruption Division:
It investigates cases against central government employees, public servants working under state governments (entrusted to the CBI by the state).
The Economic Offences Division:
It investigates financial crimes, bank frauds, money laundering, illegal money market operations, graft in PSUs and banks.
The Special Crimes Division:
It handles cases of conventional nature such as offences relating to internal security, espionage, narcotics and psychotropic substances, etc.
Consent Required by the CBI for Conducting Investigation in a State:
Legal basis:
Section 6 of the
authorises the central government to direct CBI to probe a case within the jurisdiction of any state
but only with the consent
of the concerned state government.
However,
the SC and HCs
can order CBI to investigate such a crime anywhere in the country
without the consent of the state.
Types of consent:
General consent:
When a state gives a general consent to the CBI for probing a case, the agency is not required to seek fresh permission every time it enters that state in connection with investigation or for every case.
It is normally given by states
to help the CBI in the seamless investigation of corruption cases
against central government employees in their states.
Specific consent:
When a general consent is withdrawn, CBI needs to seek case-wise (
specific
) consent for investigation from the concerned state government.
If specific consent is not granted, the CBI officials
will not have the power of police personnel when they enter that state,
preventing the CBI from conducting a thorough inquiry.
States which have withdrawn general consent so far
Withdrawal of General Consent and its Impact:
The withdrawal of general consent
does not stop
CBI probes in all cases.
continues to probe in old cases
until specifically taken back by the state government.
Further, it continues to investigate cases that were given to it by a
court order.
The CBI can also
challenge the decision
(of withdrawal of general consent) in a court showcasing its progress of investigation in the case.
When the CBI does not have a general consent,
it can approach a local court
(as per a provision in theCrPC) for a search warrant and conduct investigation.
The Supreme Court dismissed the Centre's initial objections against a lawsuit filed by West Bengal.
The state challenged the CBI's authority to register and investigate cases in West Bengal after the state withdrew its general consent on November 16, 2018.
Key takeaways of the judgement
The Supreme Court noted that the Union government is deeply involved with the CBI,
as the agency can only investigate offences notified by the Centre under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act
According to
Section 4 of the DSPE Act
, the Central Vigilance Commission oversees offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, while the Central government supervises all other matters.
The court reminded the Centre that the DSPE Act requires the state's prior consent for CBI investigations within its jurisdiction.
The agency (CBI) not being the ‘Government of India’
The Centre had earlier contended that the CBI too could not be made a defendant in the suit as the agency was not the ‘Government of India’.
Original suits filed directly in the Supreme Court under Article 131 of the Constitution exclusively deal with disputes involving the Union and the States.
And CBI is an agency not the GoI.
However, the SC Bench said the suit
raised serious questions concerning the wider ramifications of federalism

**********The case for a caste Census
Background:
Peter Drucker’s quote, “Only what gets measured gets managed,” highlights the necessity of collecting data on group identities to address discrimination effectively. This approach is essential for informed policymaking and inclusive development.
For example, Germany’s census does not record racial data, disadvantaging Black communities. In response, Black people initiated the Afrozensus survey in 2020, revealing widespread, institutional anti-Black racism in Germany.
What’s in today’s article?
Census in India – About, legal provision
Need for caste Census
Argument against caste census
The case for OBC inclusion in Census
Way forward
Population Census provides basic statistics on state of human resources, demography, culture and economic structure at local, regional and national level.
Beginning in the year 1872, when the first census was conducted non-synchronously, the census enumeration exercise in India is carried out in every 10 years.
The first synchronous census was taken under British rule in 1881, by W.C. Plowden, Census Commissioner of India.
The responsibility of conducting the decadal census rests with the Office of the
Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India
, Ministry of Home Affairs.
Legal/Constitutional basis of Census in India
Population census is listed in
Union List (entry 69)
of Seventh Schedule in Indian Constitution.
Census is conducted under the provisions of the
Census Act, 1948
Caste census
Caste was enumerated in British India Censuses (1881-1931).
Post-Independence,
the 1951 Census excluded caste enumeration except for SCs and STs, who continue to be counted
In 1961, the GOI recommended states conduct their own surveys for state-specific OBC lists, as there were no central reservations for OBCs at that time.
Though Census is a Union subject,
the Collection of Statistics Act, 2008
allows
States and local bodies to gather necessary data, as seen in Karnataka (2015) and Bihar (2023)
Social Imperative
Caste remains a key social structure in India, evidenced by low inter-caste marriages, prevalent caste surnames and marks, residential segregation, etc.
Choices of candidates for elections and ministers for Cabinets continue to be dictated by caste considerations.
Legal Imperative
Constitutionally-mandated social justice policies, including reservations in various sectors, require detailed caste data.
Although the Constitution mentions class instead of caste, the Supreme Court has ruled caste as a significant criterion for defining backward classes and supporting reservation policies.
Administrative Imperative
Detailed caste data:
helps correct wrongful caste inclusions/exclusions,
prevents dominant castes within reserved categories from monopolizing benefits,
aids in sub-categorizing castes, and
determines the creamy layer income/wealth criterion.
Moral Imperative
Lack of caste data has allowed elites among upper castes and dominant OBCs to disproportionately control national assets, income, and power.
Socially Divisive
Critics say it could deepen social divisions.
However,
it should be noted that India has had deep social divides for nearly 3,000 years. Census counts of SCs and STs since 1951 haven't led to conflicts among these groups.
Additionally, the Census already includes potentially divisive categories like religion, language, and region.
Casteism will not wither away by not counting caste in the Census, any more than communalism, and regionalism will disappear by not enumerating religion, language and region.
Administrative Nightmare
Many opponents claim that that it is an administrative nightmare.
Despite concerns, caste enumeration is feasible.
Unlike the fuzzy concept of race, caste identity is clear.
The GOI has successfully enumerated 1,234 SC castes and 698 ST tribes.
Counting the 4,000-odd other castes, mostly state-specific, should not be overly problematic.
Fueling Demands for Increased Reservations
Opponents say that it would fuel demands for increased reservations.
Rather
than fueling demands, detailed caste data could help curb arbitrary reservation demands. It would allow for objective policymaking and informed debates on reservation claims from groups like Marathas, Patidars, and Jats.
Governments often prefer vague data, allowing them to implement reservations arbitrarily for electoral gains.
Reservations for OBCs in education and public employment
The Constitution permits reservations for OBCs in education and public employment (
Articles 15(4) and 16(4
)), similar to SCs and STs.
Following the Mandal Commission, OBCs also have reservations in the Central government.
The Supreme Court's Indra Sawhney case (1992) ruling requires periodic revision of the OBC list, which is based on the 1931 Census.
No reservation in electoral constituencies for MPs and MLAs
While OBCs lack reservations in MP and MLA constituencies, the 73rd and 74th amendments (1993) mandate reservations in panchayats and municipalities for SCs, STs, and OBCs (
Articles 243D(6) and 243T(6)).
Accurate caste-wise data of OBCs is needed for this, which the GOI should have collected in the 2001 Census but did not.
Judiciary demands caste-wise data to uphold reservations
States like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha, and Jharkhand have faced judicial stays on OBC reservations in local elections due to the absence of caste-wise data.
While the judiciary demands this data, the executive has avoided collecting it
Attempt at caste Census failed
In 2010, after significant lobbying, the Parliament unanimously resolved to include caste enumeration in the 2011 Census.
The last caste enumeration in the 1931 Census identified 4,147 castes.
However, the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC)-2011, which was not conducted under the Census Act, 1948,
failed due to poor design and execution, resulting in an implausible figure of 46 lakh castes
The SECC-2011’s failure was because of the fact that it was not conducted under the Census Act, 1948 as the Act was not amended to include caste as a parameter.
It was
conducted through the Union Ministries of Rural Development and Urban Development
which did not have prior experience of conducting sociological/anthropological surveys.
Additionally, the questionnaire was poorly designed and asked open-ended questions about caste.
The enumerators couldn’t distinguish between genuine castes, alternative caste names, larger caste groups, sub-castes, surnames, clan names, gotras, etc.
To address the failures of SECC-2011, the Census Act, 1948, should be amended to mandate caste enumeration, removing the discretion of the Union executive.
Caste data should be collected during the regular Census by the Census Commissioner, with relevant questions added to the questionnaire.
Sociological and anthropological experts should draft state-specific caste lists, publish them online for public input, and finalize them before providing them to enumerators.
The questionnaire should include questions about sub-caste, caste, larger caste group, and caste surname.
Using internet-enabled devices with preloaded details would simplify and ensure accurate data collection.

**********The case for a Caste Census 
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Exception in fundamental Rights
Mains level:
The arguments against caste Census
Why in the news?
The Census Act, 1948 ought to be revised to mandate the inclusion of caste enumeration as a regular part of the Census process, incorporating specific questions in the questionnaire to gather this data systematically, rather than leaving it subject to discretionary decisions by the Union executive.
Why a Caste Census?
Social Relevance:
Caste remains a significant social determinant in India, influencing access to opportunities, resources, and representation. A caste census is essential to understand and address caste-based inequalities and social stratification accurately.
Policy Formulation:
Constitutionally mandated policies such as reservations in education, employment, and legislative bodies rely on caste-based data to ensure effective implementation. Detailed enumeration helps in identifying beneficiaries, preventing misclassification, and ensuring equitable distribution of benefits.
Administrative Precision:
Detailed caste-wise data is crucial for administrative purposes, including planning and allocation of resources. It helps in targeting development programs and policies for specific caste groups based on their socio-economic status and needs.
Historical Context:
India has a history of caste-based discrimination and marginalization. A caste census provides empirical evidence of existing disparities, enabling the government and civil society to design interventions aimed at promoting social justice and equality.
Social Divisiveness:
Critics argue that emphasizing caste through a census could perpetuate social divisions and caste identities. They fear that highlighting caste differences could exacerbate tensions and hinder national unity.
Administrative Complexity:
Conducting a caste census is seen as administratively challenging due to the sheer number of caste groups in India, estimated to be thousands, many of which are region-specific. Critics argue that accurately enumerating and categorizing these castes could pose logistical difficulties and lead to inaccuracies.
Political Implications:
There are concerns that caste-based data could be misused for electoral gains and political manoeuvring. Critics argue that caste enumeration might lead to demands for increased reservations and create further divisions along caste lines in political representation and decision-making processes.
How an attempt at caste Census failed
Constitutional Mandate:
The Constitution of India provides for reservations in education (Article 15(4)) and public employment (Article 16(4)) for OBCs. Enumerating OBCs in the Census is essential to effectively implement these constitutional provisions and ensure accurate representation.
Policy Implementation:
Detailed caste-wise data is necessary for effective policy formulation and implementation related to reservations, social justice, and welfare schemes targeting OBC communities. It helps in identifying deserving beneficiaries and avoiding wrongful inclusions or exclusions.
Judicial Imperative:
The Supreme Court of India, in various rulings like Indra Sawhney case (1992), has underscored the importance of accurate caste data for upholding reservation policies and ensuring social justice. The court has emphasized the need for periodically revising the OBC list based on updated census data.
Local Governance and Representation:
Post the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution, which introduced reservations for OBCs in local bodies (panchayats and municipalities), accurate caste data at the local level is crucial for fair representation and effective governance.
Poor Design and Execution:
The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC)-2011, conducted through Union Ministries of Rural Development and Urban Development, lacked the expertise and experience needed for sociological surveys
Legal and Administrative Challenges:
The SECC-2011 was not conducted under the Census Act, 1948, which meant it lacked the legal framework and procedural clarity required for a comprehensive census.
Way forward:
Amendment of Census Act:
Amend the Census Act, 1948, to explicitly include caste as a parameter for enumeration. This legal revision will provide a clear mandate and framework for conducting a comprehensive caste Census, ensuring adherence to standardised procedures and data collection methodologies.
Expert Involvement and Public Consultation:
Engage sociological and anthropological experts to develop a detailed list of caste categories specific to each state. Publish the draft list online for public review and feedback, facilitating transparency and accuracy in caste enumeration.
Mains PYQ:
Caste system is assuming new identities and associational forms. Hence, the caste system cannot be eradicated in India.” Comment.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS)
Mains level:
Observations made by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS)
Why in the news?
A recent study by the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) found that land-use alterations and road construction in central India affect the genetic connectivity of two prominent herbivores: the gaur and the sambar.
What is Genetic diversity?
Genetic diversity refers to the variety and variability of genetic material within a species or population, essential for adaptation, resilience to environmental changes, and long-term survival of organisms.
NCBS is a premier research institute located in Bangalore, India that is part of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) under the Department of Atomic Energy of the Government of India.
The mandate of NCBS is to conduct fundamental research in the frontier areas of biology, ranging from the study of single molecules to ecology and evolution.
Impact of Habitat Modification:
The NCBS study underscores the significant impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on wildlife populations, particularly highlighting how expanding linear infrastructure like highways and railway lines disrupts animal movement and genetic connectivity.
Genetic Connectivity of Herbivores:
It is the first study in India to investigate the genetic connectivity of large herbivores, specifically the gaur and sambar, at a landscape scale. The research reveals how these species are affected differently by landscape features and human activities, influencing their genetic diversity and ability to adapt to environmental changes.
Conservation Urgency:
The study emphasizes the urgent need for conservation measures in fragmented habitats, such as Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra, where small and genetically isolated populations of herbivores require targeted interventions to ensure their survival and genetic health.
Methodological Advances:
Using advanced genetic techniques like next-generation sequencing (NGS) and landscape genetics, the NCBS researchers demonstrated how these tools can provide crucial insights into population dynamics, genetic diversity, and the impacts of human-induced changes on wildlife populations.
Present Issues from Tiger reserves and Wildlife sanctuaries in MP and MH
Habitat Fragmentation and Connectivity:
Both states face significant challenges related to habitat fragmentation due to expanding linear infrastructure like highways and railway lines. These developments disrupt wildlife corridors essential for the movement of animals, leading to isolated populations and reduced genetic connectivity, as observed in the NCBS study.
Human-Wildlife Conflict:
Increasing instances of human-wildlife conflict pose a threat to both animals and human communities living near tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries. Encroachment of habitat for agriculture and settlements often results in conflicts over resources and occasionally leads to casualties among both wildlife and humans.
Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade:
Despite conservation efforts, tiger reserves and sanctuaries in MP and MH continue to face challenges related to poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Tigers and other endangered species are targeted for their skins, bones, and other body parts, driven by demand in illegal markets.
Resource Extraction and Mining:
Mining activities and resource extraction near protected areas pose significant environmental threats. These activities not only lead to habitat destruction but also contribute to pollution and disturbance, affecting the overall ecosystem health and biodiversity of these regions.
Climate Change Impacts:
The effects of climate change, such as erratic weather patterns and changing rainfall regimes, also impact tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries in MP and MH. These changes can alter habitat suitability for wildlife species, affecting their distribution, migration patterns, and ability to adapt to new environmental conditions.
Way forward:
Enhanced Habitat Connectivity and Protection:
Implement measures to mitigate habitat fragmentation caused by linear infrastructure. This includes creating wildlife corridors over or under highways and railways to facilitate safe animal movement
Integrated Conservation and Community Engagement:
Foster collaboration between local communities, conservation organizations, and government agencies to address human-wildlife conflict and illegal activities like poaching.

Mains level:
Impact of Climate Change on Population
Why in the news?
Since 1989, July 11 has been designated as World Population Day, marking the global population surpassing the five billion mark.
About Malthus Theory of Population
Thomas Malthus’ Theory of Population, proposed in 1798, posited that population growth would outpace food production, leading to widespread famine and poverty.
He believed population grows exponentially while food production increases linearly. However, advancements in agriculture and technology have prevented the catastrophic outcomes he predicted.
Present Scenario
Population Growth and Food Production:
Despite significant population growth, currently estimated at 8.1 billion globally, advancements in technology and agriculture have enabled food production to keep pace. This disproves Malthus’ prediction of widespread famine due to population outstripping food supply.
India’s Demographics:
India, the most populous nation with 1.44 billion people, has seen its annual population growth rate fall below 1%, with a total fertility rate (TFR) of 2, just below the replacement level. Economic growth has surged, with per capita GDP increasing sixfold from $400 to $2,400 over the past 27 years.
Poverty Reduction and Challenges:
The percentage of Indians living below the poverty line has decreased from 43% to 11%. However, significant disparities persist, with certain states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand accounting for 83% of the nation’s poverty. Climate change remains a critical challenge, disproportionately affecting poorer populations.
Changes in India
Population :
Population Growth has Increased from 1 billion to 1.44 billion (44% increase). The Annual population growth rate decreased from nearly 2% to below 1%. Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has declined from 3.4 to 2, below the replacement level of 2.1.
Economic Indicators:
Per Capita GDP has rose sixfold from $400 to $2,400, signifying substantial economic growth. And percentage of people living below the multi-dimensional poverty line decreased from 43% to 11%.
Life Expectancy:
Increased from 61 years to 70 years, indicating improvements in healthcare and living standards.
Increased Vulnerability of the Poor:
Climate change disproportionately affects poorer populations in developing countries like India. Inadequate housing, infrastructure, and resources make these communities more susceptible to the adverse effects of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves.
Agricultural Disruption:
Unpredictable weather patterns and extreme climate conditions disrupt agricultural productivity, leading to food insecurity. This particularly impacts rural populations who depend on farming for their livelihoods, exacerbating poverty and malnutrition.
Migration and Displacement:
Climate change-induced events, such as rising sea levels and severe weather, force people to migrate from their homes. This internal displacement puts additional strain on urban areas and exacerbates existing social and economic challenges, leading to overcrowding and increased competition for resources.
Agenda of Global South Population
Economic Growth and Poverty Eradication:
Developing nations in the Global South prioritize economic growth to reduce poverty and improve living standards. The focus is on sustainable development, ensuring that economic progress is not compromised while addressing the immediate needs of their populations. India’s aim to achieve zero poverty within the next decade exemplifies this priority.
Sustainable Development and Climate Responsibility:
The Global South advocates for a balanced approach to climate change, emphasizing the need for developed countries (with higher historical emissions) to take greater responsibility. The G-20 New Delhi Declaration (2023) highlights the importance of the circular economy, resource efficiency, and extended producer responsibility in achieving sustainable development without hindering economic growth.
A Pathway for the Most Populous Nation (Way Forward)
Balancing Economic Growth and Environmental Sustainability:
India must continue prioritizing economic growth to alleviate poverty and improve living standards while integrating sustainable practices. Emphasizing circular economy principles, resource efficiency, and extended producer responsibility can help decouple economic growth from environmental degradation.
Reducing Poverty and Inequality:
Targeted efforts to address regional disparities and uplift impoverished populations are crucial. Programs focusing on education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, particularly in states with high poverty levels like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand, are essential to ensure inclusive growth.
Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation:
India should implement strategies to mitigate climate change impacts, such as investing in renewable energy, enhancing disaster resilience, and promoting sustainable agriculture. While striving for net-zero emissions by 2070, India must ensure that climate actions do not compromise its economic growth and poverty eradication goals.
Mains PYQ:
Critically examine whether growing population is the cause of poverty OR poverty is the mains cause of population increase in India.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Section 125 CrPC; Alimony; Right to Equality.
PC: Hindustan Times
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court has ruled that a divorced
Muslim woman is entitled to seek maintenance
from her husband under
Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The court asserted that any discrimination against
Muslim women
in matters of
alimony
the secular laws
of the country would be regressive and against gender justice, equality.
Story so far:
The Supreme Court bench
rejected
the argument that
Section 125 of the CrPC does not apply to Muslims
because they have their own personal law.
The court ruled that the
Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, does not override the secular law.
Key Points of the Judgment
Legal Standing:
“There cannot be the disparity in receiving maintenance on the basis of the law under which a woman is married or divorced.”
Application of Section 125:
Justice Nagarathna emphasized, “Section 125 of the CrPC cannot be excluded from its application to a divorced Muslim woman irrespective of the law under which she is divorced.”
Role of the 1986 Act:
The judgment underscored that rights granted under the 1986 Act to receive maintenance during
‘iddat’
are in addition to, not in derogation of, those under Section 125 of the CrPC.
Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986:
Purpose:
To protect the rights of Muslim women who have been divorced by, or have obtained a divorce from, their husbands.
To provide for matters connected with or incidental to their divorce.
Key Provisions:
Maintenance:
During Iddat Period:
A Muslim woman is entitled to a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance from her husband during the iddat period (a waiting period after divorce).
Post-Iddat Maintenance:
If she cannot maintain herself after the iddat period, she can claim maintenance from her relatives who would inherit her property on her death. If no relatives are available, the State Wakf Board is responsible for her maintenance.
Mehr (Dower):
The woman is entitled to the payment of mehr (dower) that was agreed upon at the time of marriage.
Return of Property:
The woman is entitled to all the properties given to her before or at the time of marriage or after the marriage by her relatives, friends, husband, or any other person.
Rights of Children:
The Act also provides for the maintenance of children born out of the marriage until they reach the age of two years.
Application to Magistrate:
A divorced woman, or someone acting on her behalf, can apply to a Magistrate for an order under the Act.
The Magistrate has the authority to make orders for payment of maintenance, mehr, and return of property.
Criticisms and Issues:
Limited Scope:
Critics argue that the Act’s provisions are limited to the iddat period and do not ensure long-term maintenance.
Dependence on Relatives:
Post-iddat maintenance depends on relatives, which might not always be practical or feasible.
Role of Wakf Board:
The effectiveness of the Wakf Board in providing maintenance has been questioned due to administrative and financial constraints.
Violation of Right to Equality:
The MWPRD Act has been criticized for creating discriminatory practices by limiting the maintenance period for Muslim women compared to women of other communities, thus violating the Right to Equality under Article 14 of the Constitution.
Context and Historical Perspective:
Shah Bano Case (1985):
The court referenced the landmark Shah Bano case, which affirmed Muslim women’s right to maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC.
Danial Latifi Case (2001):
It highlighted subsequent interpretations ensuring that the 1986 Act does not deprive Muslim women of rights under Section 125.
Rejection of Restrictions:
The court rejected restrictive interpretations that could hinder gender justice and emphasized the importance of providing adequate maintenance, not minimal amounts, to destitute Muslim women.
Continuation of Section 144:
The judgment noted that the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, which has replaced the CrPC, retains the older provision on alimony under Section 144.
Maintenance Orders:
Section 125 of the CrPC provides for the maintenance of wives, children, and parents who are unable to maintain themselves.
Eligible Persons:
Wife: Includes a divorced wife who has not remarried.
Legitimate and illegitimate minor children.
Adult children are unable to maintain themselves due to physical or mental abnormalities.
Parents: Includes both father and mother who are unable to maintain themselves.
Conditions:
The person liable to pay maintenance has sufficient means.
The person liable has neglected or refused to maintain the eligible person.
Order:
The Magistrate can order a monthly allowance for the maintenance of the eligible person.
Maximum Amount:
There is no fixed maximum amount; it is determined by the Magistrate based on the circumstances.
Significance:
Social Justice:
It aims to prevent vagrancy and destitution by ensuring that dependents are provided for.
Secular Applicability:
It applies to all religions and is not specific to any particular religion.
Implications and Legal Precedent
Equality under Law:
The judgment reinforces the principle that Muslim women have the same legal recourse as women of other faiths under Section 125 of the CrPC.
Additional Remedies:
It affirmed that provisions like the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, do not exclude rights under Section 125.
