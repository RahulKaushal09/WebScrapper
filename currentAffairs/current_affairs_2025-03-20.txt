DARA SHIKOH
Syllabus:
Prelims – HISTORY
Context:
Dara Shikoh is often invoked as the nemesis of Aurangzeb. March 20th marks the birth anniversary of Dara Shikoh, who was born in 1615.
Background: –
Dara Shikoh was the eldest son of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan and was engaged in an intense battle of succession.
Key takeaways
Dara Shikoh strove to develop cordial relationships between people by finding commonalities between Hinduism and Islam.
His most important works, Majma-ul-Bahrain (Mingling of Two Oceans) and Sirr-i-Akbar (Great Mystery), are devoted to the cause of establishing connections between Hinduism and Islam.
Dara Shikoh concluded that the “hidden book” mentioned in the Quran was none other than the Upanishads and believed that to understand the Quran, one needed to study the Hindu text.
With the help of pandits, he translated 52 volumes of the Upanishads from Sanskrit to Persian into a tome called Sirr-e-Akbar (The Greatest Secret). He even drew an equation between Adam and Brahma — a view which, according to historians, led to him being branded a heretic and to his execution.
However, he was defeated by his brother Aurangzeb in the War of Succession following Shah Jahan’s illness. Thus he was executed on the orders of Aurangzeb under a fatwa issued by his clerics stating that he had apostatised from Islam.
The Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited his father’s estate. They followed the custom of coparcenary inheritance or a division of the inheritance amongst all the sons. This became the ground for the war of succession during the Mughal Empire.
The war of succession broke out in 1657 after Shah Jahan fell ill. Though all four brothers — Dara, Aurangzeb, Murad and Shuja — were locked in a bitter war, the first two were the serious contenders.
Aurangzeb battled fiercely with his brothers, eventually sentencing all three to death and confining his father to a gilded prison for the last seven years of his life.

TELANGANA ASSEMBLY PASSES SC SUB-CATEGORISATION BILL
Mains – GS 2
The Telangana Legislative Assembly passed the Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservation) Bill, 2025, paving the way for SC sub-categorisation in reservation.
This legislation follows a Supreme Court verdict supporting SC sub-categorization and affirming states’ rights to enact necessary legislation in this regard.
As per the Bill, the Scheduled Castes will be divided into three categories – Group I will get 1% reservation within the 15% quota for SCs; Group II will get 9% reservation; and Group III will get 5% reservation.
The Bill has divided 59 SC communities in the state into three groups for implementation of the 15 percent reservation for SCs. It provided one per cent reservation to 15 SC communities categorised as most socially, economically, and educationally disadvantaged/overlooked which formed 3.288 percent of the total SC population in the state.
Group-II, with 18 communities and comprising 62.748 per cent of the SC population, will be provided 9 per cent reservation and the third category comprising 26 significantly benefitted scheduled castes forming 33.963 per cent of the SC population will be given 5 per cent reservation.
Additional Information
In 1975, the Punjab issued a notification dividing its 25% SC reservation at that time into two categories. In the first category, seats were reserved solely for the Balmiki and Mazhbi Sikh communities, which were the most backward communities in the state. As a result, they were to be given first preference for any reservations in education and public employment.
The second category consisted of the rest of the SC communities, which didn’t get this preferential treatment. It was one of the first instances of existing reservations being ‘sub-classified’ by a state to provide benefits to certain communities beyond what was already being offered to scheduled caste communities as a whole.
While the notification remained in force for nearly 30 years, it ran into legal hurdles when in 2004, a five-judge constitution bench struck down a similar law introduced by Andhra Pradesh in 2000.
In ‘E.V. Chinnaiah v State of Andhra Pradesh’, the Supreme Court struck down the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000 for being violative of the right to equality. The law contained an expansive list of scheduled caste communities identified in the state and the quota of reservation benefits provided to each of them.
On August 1, 2024, In a landmark 6-1 majority ruling, a seven-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held that Scheduled Castes do not constitute a socially homogeneous class and can be sub-classified by States for the purpose of providing reservation to the less privileged among them.

MARITIME DIPLOMACY
Apart from its “soft power” and humanitarian aspects, maritime diplomacy can help contain, resolve and prevent conflict.
Maritime diplomacy is a flexible instrument that can be used to convey messages and influence events by offering a choice of naval actions, ranging from peaceful cooperation at one end to compellence and deterrence at the other.
Unlike other regions, the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has historically lacked strong institutions for security and cooperative dialogue.
There has never been a security architecture in the IOR, because diversity, combined with self-interest, has prevented the formation of functional, effective regional institutions.
Past attempts have created fragmented initiatives like IORA, SAARC, BIMSTEC, IPOI, CSC, and IONS, with limited success.
India’s Role in the IOR – Maritime Diplomacy
Indian Navy as a “First Responder”
Led Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) efforts during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and other crises.
Conducts sea-lift operations to evacuate people from disaster zones.
Security Assistance & Surveillance
India has enhanced Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), sharing real-time surveillance data with Seychelles, Mauritius, Maldives, and Sri Lanka.
Helps protect Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of island nations.
Naval Diplomacy
Indian Navy supports foreign policy through warship deployments, joint exercises, and deterrence measures.
Balances soft power (cooperation, assistance) with hard power (deterrence, security operations).
Need for a Strategic Approach
In order to realise its true potential as a “preferred security partner” and “first responder” in the IOR, New Delhi needs to develop a fully funded programme for security and HADR assistance, including amphibious heavy-lift capability and a hospital ship.
To ensure timely delivery of assistance, the impediments and delays arising from lack of MoD-MEA coordination need to be eliminated.
A whole-of-government approach is needed for maritime strategy integration into national security policy.

KAMBA RAMAYANA
Prelims & Mains – ART & CULTURE
In an effort to preserve and promote the Kamba Ramayana, one of the most significant works in Tamil literature, the South Zone Cultural Centre (SZCC), under the Ministry of Culture is launching a comprehensive initiative aimed at reviving the oral tradition of ‘Kamba Ramayana’ recitals.
This initiative will include a series of performances, workshops, symposia, and educational competitions to ensure that future generations can connect with and appreciate this epic text, which has long been integral to Tamil heritage.
The Kamba Ramayana, also known as Ramavataram, is a Tamil epic written by the poet Kambar (Kamban) in the 12th century.
It is one of the most significant literary works in Tamil literature and an important adaptation of the Valmiki Ramayana.
Style: Kamban’s writing is known for its poetic beauty, intricate descriptions, and emotional depth. He adds his own interpretations and cultural nuances to the original Valmiki Ramayana.
Cultural Context: The Kamba Ramayana reflects the socio-cultural and religious milieu of Tamil Nadu during the Chola period. It incorporates Tamil traditions, values, and aesthetics.
Comparison with Valmiki’s Ramayana:
Follows the broad structure of Valmiki’s Ramayana but introduces regional variations and character interpretations.
More devotion-centric with philosophical and ethical discourses.
Themes and Significance
Dharma and Morality: Like the Valmiki Ramayana, the Kamba Ramayana explores themes of duty, righteousness, and the struggle between good and evil.
Bhakti (Devotion): The epic highlights devotion to God, particularly through the character of Rama as an incarnation of Vishnu.
Human Emotions: Kamban’s portrayal of characters like Rama, Sita, and Hanuman is deeply emotional, making the epic relatable to readers.
Cultural Integration: The Kamba Ramayana reflects the synthesis of Sanskrit and Tamil traditions, showcasing the cultural unity of India.

**********Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)
India is progressing towards eliminating Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) through political support, community involvement, and regional cooperation.
About Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs):
NTDs are a diverse group of conditions
caused by a variety of pathogens
(including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi, and toxins) and associated with devastating health, social, and economic consequences.
NTDs are mainly
prevalent among impoverished communities in tropical areas
, although some have a much larger geographical distribution.
They are widespread
where people in vulnerable situations live
, where water safety, sanitation, and access to health care are inadequate or suboptimal.
These diseases are called “neglected” because they have
historically ranked very low on the global health agenda,
when they have appeared at all, receiving little attention and funding.
NTDs include
Guinea worm, Chikungunya, Dengue, Kala Azar
(Visceral Leishmaniasis), and
Elephantiasis
(Lymphatic Filariasis), among others.
India is home to about 12 NTDs
epidemiology of NTDs is complex;
some have animal and/or human reservoirs,
many are vector-borne
, and most are associated with
intricate life cycles.
Preventing or
eliminating NTDs is therefore challenging.
It is estimated that NTDs affect more than 1 billion people, while the number of people requiring NTD interventions (both preventive and curative) is 1.5 billion.
Every year on
30th January,
the Global community comes together to mark
World NTDs Day

**********Debate on Freebies: Rajya Sabha Chairman Calls for Structured Policy
Why in the News?
Criticising the culture of “freebies”, Vice-President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar recently said the issue should be debated in Parliament.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context, Understanding Freebies, Subsidies, etc.)
Rajya Sabha Chairman’s Point (Key Issues, Proposed Solutions, etc.)
Background:
Rajya Sabha Chairman has raised concerns over the growing culture of
, urging Parliament to hold a serious debate on the issue.
He emphasized the need for a
national policy
to ensure that government investments are
structured and used for the larger public good
His remarks came after an opposition MP demanded an increase in
Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLAD) funds
from
₹5 crore to ₹20 crore per annum
, citing rising construction costs.
Understanding Freebies and Subsidies:
Freebies refer to
government-funded benefits
such as:
Free electricity, water, or transport.
Direct cash transfers without productivity conditions.
Loan waivers for specific sectors.
Free smartphones, laptops, or other consumer goods.
These subsidies are aimed at
specific economic needs
, such as:
Agricultural subsidies
for fertilizers, seeds, and procurement prices.
Food security subsidies
through schemes like the
Public Distribution System (PDS)
Education and healthcare subsidies
for the underprivileged.
VP stressed that subsidies, where necessary, should be
directly transferred
to beneficiaries, following the model of
developed countries like the U.S.
, where farm subsidies are transparent and efficiently distributed.
Key Issues Highlighted by Rajya Sabha Chairman:
Fiscal Sustainability of Freebies
Freebies impose
significant financial burdens
on state and central governments.
They often lead to
higher fiscal deficits
, forcing governments to cut funds from essential sectors like
infrastructure, education, and healthcare
Without a
structured investment approach
, resources may be
misallocated
, affecting
long-term economic growth
Electoral Impact and Populist Allurements
Freebies are often used as
election strategies
to attract voters.
The Vice President pointed out that governments, once elected, often
struggle with the financial burden of fulfilling these promises
This raises concerns over
policy continuity and governance efficiency
The MPLAD Fund Controversy
Samajwadi Party MP
argued that current
MPLAD funds
(₹5 crore per annum) are
insufficient
due to rising costs.
He proposed an increase to
, along with
GST exemptions and a technical quality-control cell
VP linked this discussion to the broader debate on
efficient government spending
, calling for a review of
all public investment mechanisms
Disparity in Political Salaries and Perks
Dhankhar also spoke about
disparities in salaries, pensions, and perks
between
MLAs and MPs
, which vary significantly across states.
Some state legislators receive higher benefits than Members of Parliament, creating an imbalance in political remuneration policies.
standardized system of political compensation could improve transparency and fairness
Proposed Solutions for Managing Freebies:
National Policy on Government Expenditure
A clear framework should define which welfare schemes qualify as essential subsidies and which are politically motivated freebies.
Parliamentary oversight could ensure that economic policies balance social welfare and fiscal responsibility.
Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) for Welfare Schemes
Eliminating intermediaries and using DBT for subsidies can reduce leakages and corruption. Examples:
Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) Trinity has already streamlined benefit transfers.
Expanding DBT to all major welfare schemes could improve efficiency and accountability.
Performance-Based Welfare Programs
Linking benefits to employment generation, skill development, or community service can make schemes self-sustaining.
Example: Instead of free electricity, incentivizing renewable energy adoption through solar power subsidies.
Regulating Election Promises
The Election Commission of India (ECI) should consider guidelines that:
Mandate parties to disclose the financial impact of freebies before elections.
Ensure manifesto promises are backed by revenue generation plans.
A Rationalized MPLAD Fund System
While increasing MPLAD funds can improve local development, it must be:
Monitored for transparency and efficiency.
Linked to long-term projects rather than short-term political benefits.
Conclusion:
The debate on freebies is essential to ensuring responsible governance and fiscal discipline in India.  While welfare schemes play a critical role in reducing poverty, they should be financially sustainable and efficiently targeted.
With Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s call for a structured policy, the discussion on government spending, political accountability, and electoral reforms is likely to gain momentum. A national consensus on balancing welfare and fiscal responsibility is the need of the hour.

, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) unveiled the
draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules (Rules)
under the
Digital Personal Data Protection Act (Act) of 2023.
These
regulations are poised to impact India's data protection landscape,
but several critiques have emerged, notably around the Union government's discretion in appointing members to the Data Protection Board (
DPB
).
Therefore,
it is important to explore the institutional reforms necessary for the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)
to effectively handle these appeals.
Concerns Surrounding the Rules Under the Act of 2023
Executive Control Over the Data Protection Board (DPB)
significant concern with the draft Rules is the Union government’s discretion in appointing members
to the DPB,
a quasi-judicial body
responsible for resolving disputes related to personal data protection.
Rules grant the government considerable control over the selection of members of the DPB,
which has raised alarms about the separation of powers and the independence of the Board.
Appeals Process and the Role of the TDSAT
Another area of concern lies in the appeal process outlined in the draft Rules.
As per the Rules,
appeals against decisions made by the DPB
will be filed digitally before the
TDSAT will be required to dispose of these appeals within a strict six-month timeline.
While the intention to ensure timely resolution is commendable,
several issues arise regarding the feasibility of this approach.
The TDSAT is already overburdened with an extensive backlog of cases
, particularly from the telecommunications sector, which already occupies a significant portion of the tribunal’s time.
Absence of Specialised Knowledge in Data Protection
draft Rules also raise concerns
about the need for specialised expertise in data protection within the TDSAT.
Tribunals typically deal with sector-specific matters
and appoint technical members with expertise in the relevant fields.
However,
the issues surrounding data protection are distinct from those related to telecommunications
or general governance and require a specialized understanding of privacy laws, consent mechanisms, and the nuances of data processing, storage, and transfer.
Currently, the TDSAT is not equipped with technical members
who possess expertise in data protection.
Lack of Technological Infrastructure for Digital Filings
draft Rules also propose that appeals be filed in digital form.
While this aligns with the move toward digital governance
, there are concerns about the adequacy of the TDSAT’s technological infrastructure to support such filings.
tribunal's current digital infrastructure has been criticised for its limited user-friendliness and accessibility
, with many stakeholders expressing a lack of confidence in the system.
Lack of Transparency and Accountability
Finally, there is a
concern about the lack of transparency and accountability in the implementation of the Digital Personal Data Protection Ac
t and the functioning of the DPB and TDSAT.
draft Rules do not explicitly provide for the publication of detailed annual reports
or data on the functioning of these bodies.
Public access to information about the number of appeals filed
, the outcomes of cases, and the types of issues addressed is
crucial for ensuring accountability and maintaining public trust.
absence of such transparency makes it difficult for stakeholders to assess how well the system is working
and whether the rights of individuals are being effectively protected.
Necessary Institutional Reforms
The Need for a Specialist: Data Protection Expertise
The first necessary reform involves ensuring that the TDSAT has the
required expertise in data protection.
For the TDSAT to handle data protection appeals competently,
Section 14C of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 must be amended
to stipulate the appointment of a technical member with expertise in data protection.
Without such an amendment,
the TDSAT would struggle to adjudicate data protection issues effectively
, as these matters are inherently different from telecommunications concerns.
The Burden of Cases: The TDSAT’s Overburdened Docket
TDSAT’s current capacity to handle appeals from the DPB must be addressed.
The TDSAT is already grappling with a backlog of cases.
Between February 2020 and February 2025, 3,448 cases remain pending.
growing caseload, especially with the increasing volume of appeals under the newly enacted Telecommunications Act, will only exacerbate the burden
on the tribunal.
It is unrealistic to expect the TDSAT to meet the Act’s six-month timeline for disposing of appeals under these circumstances.
Increased budget allocations are needed to fund additional benches
and resources for the TDSAT.
Such investments would alleviate the current backlog
and ensure that the tribunal is better equipped to manage the rising number of appeals under the Act.
Technological Updates: Adapting to Digital Filings
third reform concerns the technological infrastructure required
to support the digital filing of appeals, as stipulated in the draft Rules.
A robust digital system is crucial to handling the expected volume of data
protection appeals efficiently.
To ensure that the TDSAT can process digital filings smoothly,
the tribunal's website must undergo significant updates.
These improvements should focus on user-friendly navigation,
improved access to case information, and efficient mechanisms for digital submissions.
Without these upgrades,
the TDSAT will struggle to manage the expected influx of data protection cases,
further hindering its capacity to meet the six-month deadline for appeals.
Ensuring Accountability and Transparency
To ensure the TDSAT remains accountable in its expanded role,
the publication of annual reports is essential.
These reports should provide a comprehensive overview of the tribunal’s performance
, detailing the number of appeals filed,
the outcomes of these appeals, and any outstanding cases.
Specifically,
information on the appeals related to data protection, telecommunications
, and broadcasting
should be presented separately to allow for targeted analysis.
Such transparency will help
foster public trust
in the tribunal’s ability to handle complex and sensitive data protection issues.
Conclusion
The draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules of 2025 outline a significant shift in India's digital governance framework
, with the TDSAT positioned as the appellate body for data protection issues.
for this system to function effectively, the TDSAT requires substantial institutional reforms.
By implementing reforms, the TDSAT will be better equipped
to manage data protection appeals and uphold the rule of law in India's rapidly evolving digital landscape.

**********A Delimitation Red Flag, the Lessons from J&K, Assam
Context
The
question of electoral delimitation
in India is a
crucial aspect of democratic governance
.
The upcoming
delimitation exercise in 2026 has sparked widespread debate
due to concerns regarding the balance of power between States, the impact on minority communities, and the overall implications for India’s federal structure.
Amid these ongoing debates,
it is crucial to examine the key arguments surrounding the issue, explores the potential dangers of disproportionate representation
, and the importance of maintaining democratic integrity in the delimitation process.
A Detailed Analysis of the Debate on Delimitation: A Democratic Dilemma
Balancing Population Growth with Representation
One of the central issues in the delimitation debate is the
disparity in population growth across different regions of India.
Northern States
such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan have experienced
rapid population growth.
On the other hand,
southern States
like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh
have managed to stabilise or even reduce their population growth
rates
through effective governance, education, and healthcare policies.
population-based delimitation
would naturally lead to an
increase in parliamentary seats for northern States
while reducing the representation of the southern States.
This
raises a critical question
: should States be rewarded or penalized for their demographic trends?
If parliamentary seats are allocated strictly based on population,
it could disincentivise efforts to control population growth,
as States that successfully implement population control measures would see their political influence diminish.
would be unfair to the southern States
, which have made significant socio-economic progress and implemented successful development policies.
Revisiting Rajya Sabha Representation
Another proposal to
counterbalance the potential loss of influence for certain States is redistributing Rajya Sabha seats
equitably among the five geographic zones of India, northern, central, eastern, western, and southern.
The Rajya Sabha, as the upper house of Parliament, is meant to represent States rather than individual voters
, making it a crucial institution in maintaining federal balance.
Currently
, Rajya Sabha representation is
uneven
, with more populous States having greater influence.
reallocation of seats across geographic zones could ensure that regions with slower population growth
do not lose their voice in national policymaking.
However,
the effectiveness of this approach depends on the functioning of India’s zonal councils,
which were originally established to resolve inter-State disputes and foster regional cooperation.
Unfortunately,
these councils have become largely inactive
, with many not convening for years.
Strengthening these councils and linking them to the Rajya Sabha’s representation
structure could
enhance cooperative federalism
and ensure that all regions have a meaningful role in governance.
Challenges to Federalism and Democratic Equity
While these proposed solutions attempt to maintain fairness in representation,
they do not fully address the deeper issue of political power dynamics in India.
purely population-based delimitation risks concentrating power in the northern States
, where electoral majorities could dictate national policies without sufficient input from the more developed southern and western States.
could lead to tensions between regions
, developing resentment and weakening national unity.
Moreover,
historical precedents suggest that delimitation exercises have sometimes been influenced by political considerations
rather than purely democratic principles.
If the 2026 delimitation follows the patterns seen in Jammu and Kashmir or Assam, where constituency boundaries were redrawn in ways that disproportionately benefited certain political groups,
it could erode trust in India’s electoral system.
Ensuring a transparent, non-partisan approach to delimitation is crucial
to preserving both democratic integrity and federal stability.
Lessons from Jammu and Kashmir and Assam
Recent experiences in Jammu and Kashmir (2022) and Assam (2023) highlight potential pitfalls
in the upcoming delimitation process.
Jammu and Kashmir delimitation added six seats to the Jammu region
but only one to the Kashmir Valley, disproportionately favouring Jammu.
Additionally,
the redrawing of constituencies resulted in administrative and geographic inconsistencies, such as the merging of Poonch and Rajouri (traditionally part of Jammu
) with the Valley’s Anantnag Lok Sabha seat.
More concerning is the
apparent communal bias in the redistricting.
All six new Assembly constituencies in Jammu were Hindu-majority, while some Muslim-majority areas were reshaped to create Hindu-majority districts.
This pattern raises alarms about the potential use of
demographic engineering
in future delimitation exercises.
Lessons from Assam
Similarly, in Assam,
the government’s decision to merge districts led to the elimination of ten Muslim-majority constituencies
while increasing Hindu and tribal seats.
The creation of constituencies with vastly different population sizes further exacerbates concerns about
political bias.
These cases suggest that population size alone is not the only factor influencing constituency creation;
communal considerations have played a role, which could have serious consequences for national unity.
The Dangers of Communal Polarisation
Despite the risks, opposition parties have largely
failed to highlight the potential communal polarisation that could result from delimitation.
While States such as West Bengal and Tamil Nadu have
historically exhibited secular voting patterns, there is no guarantee that this will continue.
If electoral boundaries are redrawn along communal lines,
the resulting polarisation could shift voting behaviours, as seen in Jammu and Assam.
further concern is the precedent set by the central government’s policies
in border States.
Harsh laws and suppressions of dissent,
once limited to conflict-prone areas, have gradually been extended to the rest of the country.
if communal redistricting is allowed in border regions, it could become a nationwide practice,
further dividing communities along religious lines.
The Way Forward: Need for a Delicate Balancing Act
debate on delimitation highlights the tension between democratic representation and federal equity.
While it is essential to ensure that all citizens are fairly represented in Parliament,
this must not come at the cost of marginalising certain States or regions.
Proposals such as freezing parliamentary seats while increasing Assembly representation and redistributing Rajya Sabha seats offer possible compromises,
but their success depends on careful implementation and political will.
As India moves toward the 2026 delimitation, policymakers must prioritise a balanced and inclusive approach
that strengthens, rather than weakens, the foundations of the country's democracy and federal structure.
Conclusion
upcoming delimitation exercise poses two major threats;
an imbalance of power between northern and southern States, and the communalisation of electoral constituencies.
If not addressed, these issues could weaken India's pluralistic democracy
and undermine the federal structure.
fair and transparent delimitation process that upholds democratic principles is essential
to ensuring equitable representation and preventing political and social fragmentation.
The challenges ahead require urgent attention from policymakers,
opposition parties, and civil society to safeguard the unity and integrity of the nation.

Editorial Analysis
**********Extradition Challenges and India's Legal Vacuum on Torture
Context:
The recent ruling by the King’s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in London,
denying the extradition
of fugitive Sanjay Bhandari, and the
ongoing appeal by Tahawwur Rana
in the U.S. Supreme Court,
highlight critical legal and human rights concerns
These cases underscore the need for India
to enact a comprehensive anti-torture law
to strengthen its legal framework and uphold its international commitments.
Extradition Cases and Human Rights Concerns:
Sanjay Bhandari’s case:
The U.K. High Court ruled against Bhandari’s extradition,
citing a real risk of custodial torture
in Indian jails.
The decision was influenced by
India's failure to ratify
the United Nations Convention against Torture (
UNCAT
).
Tahawwur Rana’s case:
Rana, accused of involvement in the
26/11 Mumbai attacks
, has cited the U.K. ruling in his U.S. Supreme Court appeal against extradition.
Similar concerns over
India’s human rights record and lack of anti-torture laws
are being leveraged by other fugitives.
India’s Ambiguous Stand on UNCAT:
India has historically
supported international human rights conventions
, including:
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1976)
Despite these commitments, India has not ratified UNCAT, placing it alongside dictatorial regimes such as
Angola, Brunei, and Sudan
Articles 51(c) and 253
of the Indian Constitution mandate adherences to international treaties, making India’s non-ratification legally and morally inconsistent.
Judicial and Legislative Inaction:
Parliamentary and legal recommendations:
The Rajya Sabha Select Committee
(2010) recommended a comprehensive anti-torture law.
The Law Commission of India
, in its 273rd Report (2017), provided a draft law on the subject.
The National Human Rights Commission (
NHRC
) has consistently advocated for standalone anti-torture legislation.
Contradictions in judicial interpretation:
In an expansive interpretation of
Article 21
of the Constitution,
The Supreme Court of India, in landmark rulings such as
D.K. Basu
(1997),
K.S.
Puttaswamy
(2017), and
Romila Thapar
(2018), have emphasized the
right to dignity and privacy
However, in
Ashwani Kumar
(2019), the Court
refrained from compelling the government
to legislate on the issue.
This is despite its several pronouncements suggesting suitable laws on different subjects (Tehseen Poonawalla (2018), Ranveer Allahabadia (2025), etc).
In Jeet S. Bisht (2007)
, the Court declared that the doctrine of separation of powers allows methods to be used to communicate to an institution either its shortcomings or excesses in discharging its duties.
In Sharaya Bano (2017)
, the Court held that constitutional rights can be defeated through inaction, indifference, or ambivalence on the part of other organs of the State
Impact of the Court’s reluctance:
It contradicts international judicial principles, which stress that the absence of legislation can undermine legal certainty and human rights protection.
Implications for India’s Democratic Credibility:
The extradition cases raise fundamental questions about India’s commitment to
democratic values and human rights
The absence of an anti-torture law weakens India’s extradition requests,
allowing fugitives to evade justice.
Failure to enact such a law
reflects political inertia
and undermines India’s credibility as a human rights defender.
Conclusion - The Urgency for Legal Reform:
India’s continued failure to legislate against torture
contradicts its democratic ethos and constitutional commitments.
The lessons from cases like
Guantanamo Bay
reinforce that state-sanctioned torture
erodes a nation’s moral standing and soft power
As India
aspires to global leadership
, enacting an anti-torture law and ratifying UNCAT are essential steps toward upholding its democratic values and
reinforcing its legal credibility.

**********Trump's New Strategy Amid U.S. Strikes on Houthis
Why in news?
The U.S. launched over 40 precision strikes on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, including Sanaa, Sadaa, and Hodeidah Port, targeting Iran-backed militants.
Former President Donald Trump warned the
and Iran, stating that Houthi attacks must stop and that Iran would face consequences for its support. He emphasized that any attack by the Houthis would be considered an attack from Iran.
In response, the Houthis escalated rhetoric and claimed multiple missile strikes on U.S. warships in the Red Sea.
What’s in today’s article?
Latest Trigger for U.S. Attacks on Houthis
Trump’s Objectives in Targeting the Houthis
Houthi Resilience and Strategic Positioning
The Houthis' actions are linked to the Gaza conflict, which escalated after Israel resumed military operations in Jabalia recently, violating a ceasefire.
Red Sea Shipping Disruptions
Since December 2023,
Houthi attacks on Red Sea
shipping lanes have forced vessels to reroute via the Cape of Good Hope, significantly increasing insurance costs and disrupting global trade.
U.S. Policy and Naval Operations
Biden's Approach
(2024): Listed Houthis as Specially Designated Global Terrorists but did not reclassify them as an FTO (Foreign Terrorist Organization).
Operation Prosperity Guardian
(2023): U.S. Navy-led mission to protect shipping lanes and ensure freedom of navigation.
Trump’s Actions (2021 & 2025)
: First designated Houthis as an FTO in 2021, then re-designated them in 2025.
Trump’s Renewed Focus on Houthis
Trump's recent Truth Social post emphasized that any Houthi attack is considered an attack by Iran, reinforcing the U.S. commitment to countering threats to global shipping and maritime security.
Shift in U.S. Military Focus
Since 2015, the U.S. has supported the Saudi-led Operation Restoring Hope against the Houthis.
During Trump’s first term (2017–2020), U.S. military actions in Yemen primarily targeted Al Qaeda and ISIS, not the Houthis.
Houthi attacks in the Red Sea over the past 15 months have drawn the U.S. into direct military action against them.
Strategic Balancing: Targeting Houthis, Avoiding Iran War
Trump’s military strikes on Houthis serve as a warning to Iran while avoiding direct confrontation.
His social media posts reinforce pressure on Tehran, signaling potential nuclear negotiation leverage.
Official U.S. Justification and Arab States’ Stance
The White House statements focus solely on protecting Red Sea shipping from Houthi attacks.
Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, have distanced themselves from U.S. military actions, with Riyadh advising restraint since January 2024 and denying logistical support for U.S. strikes.
The Houthis have withstood over 20,000 airstrikes from the Saudi-led coalition (2015–2023).
They use mobility and modular combat units, similar to Hezbollah’s asymmetric warfare strategies.
Shift to Missile and Drone Warfare
Before 2015, the Houthis did not use missiles but had already survived six wars (2004–2010) against Yemen’s government.
Since 2015, they have focused on drones, rockets, and missiles, mirroring Hezbollah’s 2006 strategy against Israel.
Despite continued U.S. and coalition airstrikes, the Houthis maintain operational capabilities, evident in ongoing attacks on Red Sea shipping.
Iran’s Role: Influence vs. Independence
Iran is the Houthis’ main but not sole backer.
Trump claims Iran controls the Houthis, but Tehran officially maintains that Ansar Allah operates independently.
Broader International Support: Russia & China
China indirectly funds the Houthis by buying 90% of Iran’s oil exports (2024).
Russia provides intelligence and is reportedly expanding small arms and missile sales to the Houthis.
Many Houthi anti-ship missiles are based on old Chinese C-802 designs.
U.S. Strikes: Limited Effect on Houthi Capabilities
American analysts agree that sporadic U.S. strikes will dent but not eliminate the Houthis’ military power.
Diplomatic and military support from Iran, Russia, and China ensures the Houthis’ continued resilience in the conflict.

What’s in today’s article?
Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM)
UPI incentive of ₹1,500 crore to banks
BHIM is a digital payment platform that enables fast, secure, and reliable transactions using the
Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
via a
mobile app
and *USSD (99#) service.
Launch and Adoption
Launched by the
Prime Minister on 30th December 2016
Achieved
1 crore downloads
on Android Play Store and

Virtual Payment Address (VPA)
and a
QR code
for easy transactions.
The Union cabinet has announced an incentive scheme for UPI payments of less than ₹2,000 for 2024–25 with an outlay of around ₹1,500 crore.
Background
The Government promotes digital payments as part of its financial inclusion strategy while ensuring diverse payment options.
The cost of digital transactions is covered through the
Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)
, which is up to 0.90% for debit cards and up to 0.30% for UPI P2M transactions.
MDR is the fee banks charge merchants for processing transactions.
Since January 2020, MDR has been waived for RuPay Debit Cards and BHIM-UPI transactions via legal amendments.
To support payment service providers, the Cabinet approved this incentive Scheme.
Aim of the Scheme
The government aims to promote digital payments and increase BHIM-UPI transaction volumes to 200 billion in FY25.
The incentive focuses on low-value peer-to-merchant (P2M) transactions to encourage small merchants.
Objectives of the Scheme
Promote the indigenous BHIM-UPI platform & Achieve a transaction volume target of ₹20,000 crore in FY25.
Strengthen digital payments infrastructure.
Expand UPI penetration in rural and remote areas through solutions like UPI 123PAY (feature phone-based) and UPI Lite/UPI LiteX (offline payments).
Maintain high system uptime and reduce technical failures.
Incentive Structure
For transactions up to ₹2,000:
Small merchants: 0.15% incentive.
Large merchants: No incentive.
For transactions above ₹2,000: No incentives for any merchant.
Benefits of the Scheme
Enhances digital transactions' convenience, security, and efficiency.
Ensures zero additional charges for consumers and small merchants.
Encourages UPI adoption among small merchants, aiding financial inclusion.
Supports the government’s push for a less-cash economy.
Ensures 24/7 availability of UPI services by incentivizing banks to maintain uptime and minimize technical failures.
Balances UPI growth with minimal financial burden on the government.
Industry Concerns Over Insufficient Allocation
The digital payment industry believes ₹1,500 crore is inadequate for sustaining UPI processing costs.
Industry estimates suggest ₹4,000-₹5,000 crore is needed to support the ecosystem.
Experts suggest introducing a controlled MDR of 0.25% for merchants with over ₹40 lakh turnover while keeping incentives for smaller merchants.

**********[20th March 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: A delimitation red Flag — the lessons from J&K, Assam
Polity
PYQ Relevance:
“The states in India seem reluctant to empower urban local bodies both functionally as well as financially.” Comment.
(2023)
Reason:
It touches upon the broader theme of federalism and the distribution of power within the Indian political system, which is relevant to concerns about the Union government’s role and potential influence in the delimitation process.
Mentor’s Comment:
The ongoing debate on delimitation raises concerns about power imbalances, particularly for southern States. A democratic approach could freeze parliamentary seats while increasing Assembly seats in high-growth States. Strengthening zonal councils and reviving the dormant Inter-State Council (inactive since 2016) can ensure balanced representation, fostering cooperative federalism and addressing regional disparities effectively.
Today’s editorial highlights the debate on delimitation raises concerns about power imbalances, particularly for southern States. This content would help in GS paper 2 (representation in Parliament)  and GS 3 ( Internal security issues arise due to it).
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Another risk of delimitation is the division of electoral constituencies based on religion or community.
What are the risks of dividing electoral constituencies based on religion or community during delimitation?
Gerrymandering to Favor Specific Communities:
Delimitation can be used to redraw boundaries in a way that benefits certain religious or ethnic groups while marginalizing others.
Example:
In Jammu & Kashmir (2022), Hindu-majority areas in Jammu received more seats despite having a lower population compared to Muslim-majority Kashmir
Note: Gerrymandering
means
changing the
size and borders of an area for voting
in order to
give an unfair advantage to one party in an election
Reduced Political Representation for Minority Groups:
If constituencies are redrawn to dilute minority votes, their political influence can weaken, leading to unfair representation.
In Assam (2023), boundary changes in Muslim-majority areas reportedly made it harder for their votes to impact election outcomes.
Increased Social and Political Divisions:
When constituencies are created along religious lines, it can deepen communal tensions and polarize elections.
In Uttar Pradesh, past constituency adjustments have led to concerns that Muslim-majority areas were fragmented to reduce their electoral strength.
What are the key concerns regarding the fresh delimitation of legislative constituencies in India?
Population-Based Seat Allocation May Reduce Representation for Progressive States:
Delimitation based on population growth would increase parliamentary seats for northern States (e.g., Uttar Pradesh, Bihar) while reducing influence for southern States (e.g., Tamil Nadu, Kerala), which have controlled population growth through successful policies.
Risk of Communal Gerrymandering:
Past delimitation exercises, such as in
, suggest that constituency boundaries may be redrawn to benefit certain religious or ethnic groups, marginalizing minorities.
Disproportionate Voter Representation:
Unequal constituency sizes create voter disparities. For instance, in
, Hindu-majority seats had smaller electorates (as low as 50,000), while Muslim-majority seats had much larger voter populations (up to 1.92 lakh).
Potential Weakening of Federalism:
Southern States fear that increased parliamentary seats for northern States could shift national policymaking priorities away from their economic and developmental interests, reducing their influence in governance.
Lack of Institutional Safeguards Against Political Manipulation:
Bodies like the
(dormant since 2016) and
Zonal Councils
(irregular meetings) are weak, limiting their role in addressing regional concerns, leaving room for politically motivated delimitation decisions.
Why are the Southern States apprehensive about the potential power imbalance due to delimitation?
Population Control Efforts Could Lead to Reduced Representation:
Southern States like
Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh
have successfully controlled population growth through better healthcare, education, and family planning. However, delimitation based on population increase would benefit northern States like
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
, reducing the parliamentary strength of the South.
Disproportionate Economic Contribution vs. Political Representation:
Southern States contribute significantly to India’s GDP and tax revenues. For example,
Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are among the top GST-contributing States
. A shift in political representation favouring the North could mean economic policies are shaped without adequate input from these high-contributing regions.
Risk of Policy Marginalization:
More parliamentary seats for northern States could result in national policies that favour their interests (e.g., agricultural subsidies, welfare schemes) over industrialized and service-based economies in the South.
For instance, the
15th Finance Commission’s devolution formula already reduced allocations to progressive States like Kerala
due to their lower population growth.
Federalism and Autonomy at Risk:
Southern States emphasize federalism and regional autonomy, and a population-based delimitation could further
centralize power in the hands of the Hindi-speaking belt
, reducing the political influence of non-Hindi-speaking States.
Precedents of Unequal Representation in Recent Delimitations:
Jammu & Kashmir (2022) and Assam (2023) delimitations
have shown how constituency boundaries can be redrawn in ways that favour certain regions or communities. Southern States fear similar political maneuvering could reduce their legislative influence in the future.
How did the recent delimitation exercises in Jammu & Kashmir and Assam impact electoral representation?
Disproportionate Seat Allocation Between Jammu and Kashmir:
Jammu was given
six additional Assembly seats
, while Kashmir, despite having a larger population, received only
one additional seat
Before delimitation, Kashmir had
46 seats
and Jammu had
37
. After delimitation, Kashmir got
47
, while Jammu increased to
43
, altering the political balance in favor of Jammu.
Gerrymandering Along Communal and Regional Lines:
Constituency boundaries were redrawn in a way that seemed to favor Hindu-majority areas, potentially benefitting the
BJP
Muslim-majority Kishtwar district
saw boundary changes that made it more Hindu-dominated. Similarly, Rajouri and Poonch (Jammu) were merged with Anantnag (Kashmir) in a
new Lok Sabha seat
, despite geographical and cultural differences.
Unequal Representation in Terms of Voter Population:
Some Muslim-majority constituencies in Kashmir had
more than 1.5 lakh voters
, while many new Jammu seats had
significantly fewer voters
, making votes in Jammu more influential.
Dooru (1.92 lakh voters) and Surankote (1.77 lakh voters)
had much larger populations than new seats in Jammu with
50,000–60,000 voters
Weakened Political Representation for Kashmiri Parties:
The changes were seen as reducing the influence of Kashmiri-based parties like the
National Conference (NC) and PDP
, while consolidating the BJP’s hold in Jammu.
The BJP has never won a seat in Kashmir. By increasing Jammu’s seats, it has improved its chances of influencing J&K’s electoral outcomes.
First-Time Reservation for Scheduled Tribes (STs):
The delimitation
reserved 9 Assembly seats
for Scheduled Tribes, mostly benefiting Gujjar and Bakarwal communities in Jammu.
The new ST-reserved seats include
Rajouri, Mendhar, and Surankote
, marking the first time STs have been granted separate representation.
What are zonal councils and Inter-State Council (inactive since 2016)?
Zonal Councils, established under the
States Reorganisation Act, 1956,
promote regional cooperation among States in five zones.
Inter-State Council, set up under Article 263
of the Constitution, facilitates Centre-State and inter-State coordination.
How can strengthening zonal councils and reviving the dormant Inter-State Council (inactive since 2016) help ensure balanced representation in India?
Addressing Regional Imbalances in Representation:
By ensuring regular meetings of zonal councils, States across different regions can voice concerns regarding political representation and economic disparities.
If southern States lose parliamentary seats due to population-based delimitation, zonal councils can advocate for compensatory measures like additional Rajya Sabha representation.
Enhancing Cooperative Federalism:
The Inter-State Council can serve as a platform to mediate Centre-State and inter-State disputes, ensuring all regions get equitable political influence.
Resolving issues like tax devolution, resource allocation, and governance models that disproportionately impact southern States due to shifting parliamentary strength.
Strengthening Policy Coordination Among States:
Zonal councils can facilitate coordinated development policies, ensuring that national decisions reflect regional concerns, especially in underrepresented areas.
The Southern Zonal Council could push for greater investment in infrastructure and technology sectors, ensuring economic contributions translate into policy influence.
Way forward:
Balanced Representation Through a Hybrid Formula:
Instead of relying solely on
hybrid model
considering factors like
economic contribution, governance efficiency, and demographic stability
should be adopted.
Finance Commission’s tax devolution formula
considers multiple parameters beyond population; a similar approach can be applied to delimitation to ensure
fair representation for both high-growth and high-population States
Independent and Transparent Delimitation Process:
constitutional bodies like the Delimitation Commission and Election Commission

**********Telecom tribunal reforms to handle data protection pleas 
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Data protection;
Why in the News?
In early January this year, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) published the draft
Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025
under the
Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
.
What are the key criticisms of the draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025?
Lack of Independence in the Data Protection Board (DPB):
The Union government has full discretion in appointing DPB members, raising concerns about
executive overreach
and lack of
independent oversight
Example:
Since the DPB has quasi-judicial functions, government control over appointments could compromise its impartiality in handling data protection disputes.
Inefficiency in the Appellate Mechanism:
Appeals from DPB decisions will be heard by the
Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)
, which is
already overburdened
with cases.
As of early 2025,
3,448 cases
were pending in TDSAT, making it unrealistic to resolve data protection appeals within the required
six-month timeline
Weak Digital Infrastructure for Appeals:
The draft Rules require appeals to be filed
digitally
, but TDSAT’s website and case management systems
lack efficiency and transparency
The TRAI Annual Report (2023) mentioned a
new legal case management system
, but its effectiveness and implementation status remain unclear.
What is the
Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)?
is a quasi-judicial body in India established in 2000 under the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Act, 1997
It resolves disputes related to telecommunications, broadcasting, and information technology and also serves as an appellate body for regulatory decisions.
Why is the appointment of a technical member with expertise in data protection considered necessary for the TDSAT?
Complexity of Data Protection Issues:
Data protection cases involve legal principles like
consent, data processing, storage, and unauthorized use
, which differ from telecom disputes.
A case involving
unauthorized data sharing by a tech company
requires expertise in privacy laws, which a telecom specialist may not possess.
Mismatch Between Existing Expertise and New Responsibilities:
Section 14C of the
TRAI Act, 1997
allows TDSAT members with expertise in
telecommunications, technology, commerce, or administration
, but not in data protection.
TDSAT is well-equipped for telecom disputes (e.g., spectrum allocation cases) but lacks specialists to handle
data privacy violations under the DPDP Act, 2023
Need for a Legal Amendment to Ensure Specialization:
Amending Section 14C of the TRAI Act to
include data protection as a required expertise
will help TDSAT make informed decisions.
If a
social media platform misuses personal data
, a technical member with
privacy law knowledge
can ensure proper adjudication.
How does the increasing caseload of the TDSAT impact its ability to handle appeals from the DPB within the stipulated six-month timeline?
High Pending Case Load:
remain unresolved in TDSAT, making it difficult to accommodate additional data protection appeals.
If a major data breach case is filed, it may face delays due to the backlog of
telecom and broadcasting disputes
Burden of New Telecommunications Act Cases:
The recently enacted
Telecommunications Act, 2023
will increase TDSAT’s caseload, further stretching its resources.
Disputes over
telecom licensing and spectrum allocation
could slow down hearings on
personal data protection violations
Limited Judicial and Technical Expertise:
In January 2025, TDSAT had only
one technical member
no judicial member
, raising concerns about fair adjudication.
Without a
judicial expert
, appeals related to
data misuse by companies
may not receive proper legal scrutiny.
Structural Capacity Constraints:
TDSAT has a
single bench
, making it impossible to efficiently handle
multiple categories of appeals
simultaneously.
A delay in
telecom tariff disputes
could push back hearings on
privacy-related cases
filed under the DPDP Act, 2023.
Way forward:
Strengthening TDSAT’s Capacity:
Increase the number of benches and appoint members with expertise in
data protection and privacy laws
to handle DPB appeals efficiently.
Section 14C of the TRAI Act, 1997
to include data protection specialists can ensure proper adjudication.
Independent and Efficient DPB:
autonomy
in DPB appointments and establish a
dedicated appellate body
for data protection cases to reduce TDSAT’s burden.
Setting up a
Data Protection Appellate Tribunal (DPAT)
with specialized judges and technical members can improve efficiency.
Mains PYQ:
Critically examine the Supreme Court’s judgement on ‘National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014’ with reference to appointment of judges of higher judiciary in India.
(2017)
Reason:
It touches upon the importance of the structure and appointment processes within judicial bodies, which is a relevant underlying theme also present in the discussion about the need for a data protection expert within the TDSAT.
**********A regional divide in blue-collar worker migration from India
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Migration; Remittances;
Why in the News?
Recent data show a decline in remittances from Gulf countries to India, while contributions from advanced economies have grown.
Why has the share of remittances from Gulf countries to India declined while contributions from advanced economies have increased?
Wage Stagnation and Cost of Living in the Gulf:
Wages in Gulf countries have remained relatively stagnant, while the cost of living has increased, reducing the savings and ability to send money home of Indian workers.
Example:
The UAE introduced a Value Added Tax (VAT) in 2018, increasing living costs for migrant workers.
Shift in Migration Patterns Toward High-Income Countries:
More Indian professionals and skilled workers are migrating to advanced economies like the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., where salaries are higher.
The number of Indian students and skilled workers in Canada has surged, contributing to rising remittances from the country.
Stringent Localization Policies in the Gulf:
Gulf nations have implemented employment nationalization policies that push for localization in jobs (e.g., Saudization in Saudi Arabia, Nitaqat in UAE), shrinking opportunities for foreign workers, including Indians.
Depreciation of Gulf Currencies Against the U.S. Dollar:
The exchange rates of Gulf currencies, which are tied to U.S. dollar, have not appreciated significantly, while the Indian rupee has remained relatively stable.
A stronger U.S. dollar means remittances from the U.S. convert to more Indian rupees compared to Gulf remittances.
Expansion of India’s IT and Healthcare Workforce Abroad:
Skilled professionals in IT, healthcare, and finance are securing jobs in developed countries, leading to increased remittances from these sectors.
Indian tech workers in the U.S. under the H-1B visa program send substantial remittances back home, contributing to the U.S.’s growing share.
Global Migration & Remittance Shifts: How India Compares with Other Nations
Traditional Remittance Sources
New Migration Trends
Key Drivers of Change
Gulf countries (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar)
U.S., Canada, U.K., Germany
Wage stagnation in the Gulf, rise in high-skilled migration, better job opportunities in advanced economies
Philippines
Middle East, Southeast Asia
U.S., Canada, Australia
Strong demand for healthcare workers, education-driven migration, better worker rights in Western nations
Vietnam
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan
U.S., Europe, Australia
Economic ties with Western economies, investment in skilled workforce
Mexico
Europe, South America
Stricter U.S. immigration policies, expansion of trade ties with Spain and Latin America
Bangladesh
Gulf countries, Malaysia
Limited shift; still Gulf-dependent
Fewer high-skilled migration pathways, reliance on traditional labor jobs
Pakistan
Saudi Arabia, UAE
Minimal change; remains Gulf-dependent
Economic constraints, limited alternative migration routes
What are the reasons behind the decline in the number of blue-collar workers emigrating from the Southern States to the Gulf?
Improved Employment Opportunities in India:
Economic growth and industrial expansion in southern states have created more local job opportunities, reducing the need for migration.
Tamil Nadu and Telangana have seen growth in manufacturing (automobiles, electronics) and IT sectors, offering better wages compared to low-paying Gulf jobs.
Stringent Gulf Employment Policies & Localization Programs:
Gulf nations have implemented policies like
Emiratization
, prioritizing local workers over foreign laborers, reducing demand for Indian blue-collar workers.
Saudi Arabia’s
system has restricted Indian employment in sectors like retail and construction.
Higher Migration Costs and Reduced Financial Returns:
The cost of migration, including visa fees, recruitment charges, and living expenses, has risen, while wages in the Gulf have remained stagnant, making migration less attractive.
In Kerala, many workers are opting for European destinations (e.g., Italy, Germany) instead of the Gulf due to better wages and worker rights.
How has the shift in migration patterns impacted States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and West Bengal in terms of remittance inflows?
Slower Growth in Remittance Inflows:
These states still send large numbers of workers to the Gulf, where wages and remittances are lower compared to advanced economies.
Despite high migration from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, their share in India’s total remittances remains low (around 3%), while Kerala and Maharashtra, with migrants in high-income countries, receive a higher share.
Limited Economic Upliftment Due to Lower Earnings:
Since Gulf remittances have lower financial returns, households in these states see limited improvements in savings and investments.
While Tamil Nadu and Kerala benefit from higher wages in the U.S. and the U.K., families in Rajasthan and West Bengal largely rely on low-wage Gulf jobs, leading to slower economic mobility.
Higher Economic Vulnerability and Migration Dependency:
With fewer alternative employment opportunities, many continue to migrate to the Gulf despite lower wages, reinforcing economic dependence on remittances.
Unlike Punjab, where migration to Canada has increased financial stability, states like Bihar still rely on remittances from Gulf labor, leaving them more vulnerable to economic downturns in the region.
Which factors contribute to the continued high migration from northern and eastern States to the Gulf despite lower financial returns?
Skill Development and Certification Programs:
Initiatives like the
Pravasi Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PKVY)
aim to enhance the skills of Indian workers, making them eligible for higher-paying jobs abroad.
The program aligns skill training with international standards, increasing employment prospects in advanced economies.
Bilateral Agreements and Labour Welfare Measures:
India has signed labor agreements with Gulf countries to ensure better working conditions, fair wages, and legal protection for migrant workers.
India-UAE MoU on Labor Cooperation
provides safeguards against exploitation and ensures wage protection.
Promotion of High-Skilled Migration and Diversification:
The government is encouraging migration to advanced economies through relaxed visa policies and partnerships with countries like the U.S., Canada, and Germany.
Agreements like the
India-Germany Skilled Workers Pact
facilitate migration of IT and healthcare professionals to high-income countries.
Way forward:
Enhancing High-Skilled Migration Pathways:
The government should strengthen bilateral agreements with high-income countries to facilitate the migration of skilled professionals, particularly in IT, healthcare, and engineering.
Expanding initiatives like the
and negotiating better visa policies with the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. will ensure higher remittance inflows.
Skill Development and Certification for Diversified Destinations:
To reduce dependence on Gulf remittances, India should invest in
internationally recognized skill training
through programs like
and collaborate with European and East Asian countries for labor mobility agreements.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the changes in the trends of labour migration within and outside India in the last four decades.
(2015)
Reason:
This PYQ asks for a discussion of changes in labour migration trends over a significant historical period (the last four decades) and across both internal and external migration.
