Pardhi Community
Forest rights activists and lawyers across the country expressed their concern over the recent MP government order calling for extensive search and surveillance of nomadic tribes, including the Pardhi community, which is classified as a scheduled tribe.
About Pardhi Community:
Pardhis are a
nomadic community
that, since the time of the
Mughal emperors,
have been
hired to help in shikar (hunting),
whether it was for sport for the British or for the royal kitchens of the ‘zamindars’ (landowners).
They
reside mainly in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh,
and also in small pockets of Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.
The word pardhi comes from paradh, which means hunter in the Marathi language.
In 1871,
the Pardhis were among the tribes
notified as “hereditary and habitual criminals” under
the colonial-era
Criminal Tribes Act.
After independence,
the Indian government “
denotified” these communities
in 1952.
Occupation
: Though the
major occupation
of the Pardhi tribes is
hunting and gathering,
some have taken up diverse occupations like
cultivation
and some other occupations following the traditions of most of the tribes of the country.
Language
The main language of the Pardhi tribes is their
local dialect,
which is of the
same name.
Many of them
speak a dialect of the Gujarati
In the northern parts of their habitat, they speak a combination of Hindi and Marwari.
Beliefs
Though they are
officially Hindu,
most of the Pardhi practice ethnic religions.
They are firm believers in the
spirit world
and its influence on the
physical world.

**********Biodiversity Leak
Recently, a study published in Science journal highlighted about biodiversity leakages happening across the globe.
About Biodiversity Leak:
Biodiversity Leakage is a phenomena where the
displacement of nature-damaging
human activities caused by protecting or restoring areas of land.
In this process
conservation policies in one region
inadvertently drive environmental degradation in another region.
It occurs when
restrictions on agricultural production
in conservation areas lead to increased demand for imports from other regions, often rich in biodiversity.
Biodiversity leakage is undermining global efforts to halt biodiversity loss.
There are concerns that large-scale conservation initiatives in regions like Europe and China are causing production shortfalls for agricultural commodities.
Measures to mitigate biodiversity leakage:
Tracking changes in food or wood production
within intervention areas as part of routine programme monitoring.
Scrutinising projects that report near-zero
losses in production to distinguish those with effective leakage mitigation from those with little or no conservation impact.
Including explicit consideration of both local and long-range leakage
in national and international conservation policies.
Reducing demand for high-leakage goods
and improving efficiencies in line with production decreases.
Targeting conservation efforts
in areas where biodiversity restoration will cause minimal displacement of production.
Increasing yields
within or near conservation project areas to offset losses.

**********India Needs to Grow at Average 7.8 Per Cent - World Bank
Why in the News?
The World Bank has recently published a report titled “
Becoming a High-Income Economy in a Generation
".
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context)
Key Highlights of the Report (Challenges, Potential, Emission Concerns, Way Forward, etc.)
Introduction:
As per the World Bank’s latest report,
, India has made remarkable economic progress over the past two decades, achieving an average growth rate of 6.3% between 2000 and 2024.
However, to transition into a high-income economy by 2047, India must sustain an annual GDP growth rate of 7.8%, the report says.
The report outlines key policy areas where India must accelerate reforms, including investment, labor force participation, structural transformation, and regional economic development.
It draws lessons from successful transitions of nations like
Chile
South
Korea
Poland
, emphasizing the need for deeper integration into the global economy.
India’s Growth Potential and Challenges:
India’s economic success has been built on rapid industrialization, a booming services sector, and strong macroeconomic stability.
country’s GDP per capita has nearly tripled since 2000
, and its share in the global economy has doubled to 3.4% in 2023.
Despite these achievements, the report warns that maintaining a business-as-usual approach will not be enough to achieve high-income status.
India’s Gross National Income (GNI) per capita must increase nearly eightfold, requiring structural reforms at an unprecedented scale.
The report outlines four critical areas for policy action:
Boosting Investment
Increase private and public investment from 33.5% of GDP to 40% by 2035.
Encourage higher foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows.
Develop robust financial markets to support long-term infrastructure financing.
Enhancing Labor Force Participation
Improve overall labor force participation from 56.4% to 65% by 2047.
Raise female labor force participation from 35.6% to 50%.
Invest in human capital development through skill enhancement programs.
Structural Transformation and Technology Adoption
Reduce agricultural employment from 45% to align with global peers like Vietnam and China.
Promote digitalization and integration into global value chains.
Strengthen research and development initiatives in high-growth sectors.
Enabling Regional Growth
Focus on infrastructure, healthcare, and education in underdeveloped states.
Encourage developed states to deepen business reforms and global trade participation.
Economic Growth and Emission Concerns:
As India pursues higher growth, balancing economic expansion with environmental sustainability is critical.
The country must adopt clean energy technologies, promote electric mobility, and invest in sustainable urbanization to ensure that growth does not come at the cost of environmental degradation.
The World Bank suggests that India’s economic strategy must align with global climate commitments, emphasizing green investments in key sectors such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, and sustainable agriculture.
India’s Current Growth Trajectory:
India has already shown strong momentum, with its GDP growth averaging 7.2% in the past three years.
However, sustaining this growth over the next two decades will require significant policy coordination.
The report highlights that while India’s economic policies have driven progress, global uncertainties such as geopolitical tensions, trade disruptions, and climate risks could impact future growth.
Ensuring resilience through diversified trade and self-sufficiency in critical industries will be vital.
Path Forward – Policy Recommendations:
To meet the ambitious 2047 target, the World Bank emphasizes:
Encouraging Entrepreneurship and Innovation
: Supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to foster job creation and new technologies.
Financial Sector Reforms
: Expanding access to credit for startups and industries.
Urbanization and Infrastructure
: Strengthening smart city projects and efficient public transport networks.
Trade and Investment Liberalization
: Negotiating new trade agreements and reducing barriers to business.
By implementing these reforms, India can sustain high growth, create employment opportunities, and improve the standard of living for its citizens.
Conclusion:
India’s aspiration to become a high-income economy by 2047 is ambitious but achievable with the right policy framework.

**********Amir Khusrau: The Musical Torchbearer of Sufi Syncretism
Why in news?
PM Modi, at the 25th Jahan-e-Khusrau festival, described this festival as carrying the “fragrance of the soil of Hindustan.”
Jahan-e-Khusrau, a three-day festival, brings together artists from across the world to celebrate the legacy of Amir Khusrau.
, known as Tuti-yi-Hind (Parrot of India), is regarded as a key figure in North India’s
Ganga-Jamuni culture
. He made significant contributions to
Indian classical music, qawwali
, and developed
Hindavi
, a precursor to
modern Hindi and Urdu
What’s in today’s article?
Khusrau: The ‘Indian Turk’
Khusrau: The Poet of the Sultans
Khusrau: The Devoted Disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya
Khusrau’s Enduring Legacy
Much of what is known about Khusrau comes from his own writings, which contain autobiographical information.
Early Life and Family Background
Amir Khusrau’s father migrated from Central Asia to India in the 13th century, escaping the Mongol invasions led by Genghis Khan.
He entered the service of Sultan Iltutmish (1211–36) and married an Indian Muslim woman.
Their second child,
Abu'l Hasan Yamin ud-Din Khusrau
, was born in 1253.
Cultural Synthesis in His Identity
Khusrau embraced both his Turkic and Indian heritage, a theme reflected in his writings.
Various scholars described him as a symbol of cultural fusion, and he often referred to himself as an “Indian Turk.”
Birthplace
Though Patiyali (Etah, Uttar Pradesh) is widely believed to be his birthplace, Khusrau himself never mentioned it in his writings.
Amir Khusrau became a professional poet at age 20 and remained so until his death.
He initially served princes and nobles before securing a permanent place in the Delhi Sultanate’s court.
Role of Praise Poetry
In medieval Islamic culture, praise poetry was a key tool for rulers to establish their cultural and political legitimacy.
Court poets relied on royal patronage and faced fierce competition.
Khusrau also served at least five Delhi Sultans
Muizuddin Qaiqabad
Jalaluddin Khalji
Alauddin Khalji
Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah
Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq
He also had many influential patrons over five decades, showcasing the exceptional quality of his poetry.
wrote in Persian, the court language, as well as
Honors and Recognition
Sultan Jalaluddin Khalji conferred on him the title of ‘Amir’.
Historian Ziauddin Barani recorded in Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi that Jalaluddin held Khusrau in great esteem, and that Khusrau
served as keeper of the Qur’an
in his court.
Amir Khusrau was the most beloved disciple of the Chishti saint Nizamuddin Auliya. The saint held him in high regard, once declaring:
“He (Khusrau) is the keeper of my secrets, and I shall not set foot in Paradise without him.” - Nizamuddin Auliya (Quoted in The Life and Works of Amir Khusrau, 1929)
Balancing the Court and the Khanqah
Khusrau was respected both in the royal court and in the Sufi khanqah. Despite navigating two different worlds, his loyalty was never questioned.
“Neither the king nor the saint ever suspected his loyalty, as he frequented both with equal respect and honor.” — Saifullah Saifi wrote in Sufi Poet Amir Khusrau: A Link between the Court and the Khanqah (2011)
A Shared Fate in 1325
Master and disciple passed away within months of each other in 1325.
Upon hearing of Nizamuddin Auliya’s death, Khusrau is believed to have expressed his grief through these poetic words:
“Beauty sleeps on the bed, her hair across her face. Come Khusrau, let’s go home, night has set over this place.”
A Timeless Poet
Even 700 years after his death, Amir Khusrau’s lyrical beauty, wordplay, and diverse themes continue to captivate audiences.
He wrote across genres, from royal eulogies to folk songs, riddles, and word games.
“On the one hand he wrote eulogies for kings and princes, on the other hand he wrote riddles, jingles, and homely songs.” — Saifi
A Bridge Between Cultures
blended Persian and Turkic traditions with local influences
, helping shape
Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb
, a Hindu-Muslim syncretic culture.
He also praised Hindu philosophical thought:
“The Brahmans of India have a greater wealth of philosophical thought than what Rumi revealed.” - (wrote in masnavi Nuh Siphir, quoted in Indian Literary Criticism: Theory and Interpretation, ed. G.N. Devy)
Musical Contributions
Khusrau’s ghazals and qawwalis remain popular, performed in Sufi dargahs and Bollywood. His famous compositions include:
Chhaap Tilak
Zehal-e-Maskeen
Sakal Ban Phool Rahi Sarson
He is also credited with
shaping Indian classical music
, including:
Crafting dozens of ragas
Developing ornate khayal music
Inventing the sitar and tabla (though evidence remains limited)

**********India’s Aditya-L1 spots solar flare ‘kernel
Why in news?
, India’s first space-based solar mission, has achieved a breakthrough as its Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) captured the first-ever image of a solar flare ‘kernel’ in the lower solar atmosphere, specifically in the photosphere and chromosphere.
The photosphere is the visible surface of the sun, while the chromosphere is a layer above the photosphere.
What’s in today’s article?
Solar Corona: The Sun’s Outermost Layer
Solar Flare
Study the Solar flares by Aditya-L1
The solar corona is the Sun's outermost layer of atmosphere, made of ionized gas. It's visible during a total solar eclipse or with a special telescope called a coronagraph.
Characteristics of the Solar Corona
Extremely Hot:
Temperatures range from
1 to 10 million Kelvin
, much hotter than the Sun’s surface.
Plasma Composition:
Made of highly ionized gas.
Dynamic Structure:
Constantly changing due to the Sun’s magnetic fields.
Emits High-Energy Radiation:
Produces significant ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.
Importance of the Solar Corona
Helps in
understanding solar processes
and predicting heliospheric events.
Responsible for the
solar wind
, formed by the outward expansion of corona plasma.
A solar flare is a sudden and intense burst of solar energy from the Solar atmosphere.
This phenomenon is caused by Sun’s magnetic field.
The magnetic field of the Sun is very dynamic in nature. Sometime they suddenly snap and release intense burst of energy – like a powerful, short flash.
These flares emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including X-rays and ultraviolet light, and can impact space weather, disrupting satellite communications, GPS, and power grids on Earth.
Solar flares often originate from sunspots and are classified into categories (A, B, C, M, and X) based on their intensity.
SUIT is one of the
seven payloads on Aditya-L1
, designed to capture full-disk images of the Sun in the 2000–4000 Å wavelength range, which has never been obtained before.
Key Features & Importance
Records images in a wavelength crucial for maintaining Ozone and Oxygen in Earth's atmosphere.
Measures UV radiation, which can be hazardous for skin cancer.
Addresses fundamental questions about the higher-temperature solar atmosphere and the origin of near-ultraviolet radiation.
Aids in studying high-energy solar flares and solar radiation from Hard X-ray to Infrared.
Supports in-situ measurements of solar wind particles and the Sun’s magnetic field at L1 point.
Recently, the
SUIT (Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope)
payload on
observed an
X6.3-class solar flare
, one of the most intense solar eruptions.
Unique NUV Brightening Observation
SUIT captured brightening in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) wavelength range (200-400 nm), a region never observed in such detail before.
This confirms that the flare’s energy spreads through different layers of the Sun’s atmosphere.
Confirmation of Energy-Temperature Linkage
The localized brightening in the lower solar atmosphere was found to correspond with an increase in plasma temperature in the solar corona, validating long-standing theories.
This observation provides new insights into the physics of solar flares, helping to refine our understanding of these massive solar explosions.

**********Union Cabinet Approves Amendments Proposed by the JPC to the Waqf (Amendment) Bill
Why in News?
The Union Cabinet has approved all 14 amendments proposed by the
Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)
Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024
.
The Bill is expected to be tabled in Parliament during the second half of the Budget session starting on March 10.
The amendments address key provisions concerning the regulation, registration, and dispute resolution mechanisms for waqf properties in India.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background
Key Amendments Approved by the JPC
Conclusion
Background:
The Bill was introduced in August 2023 to
amend the Waqf Act, 1995,
which governs the management of waqf properties in India.
It proposed significant changes
, including increased government oversight of waqf properties and dispute resolution mechanisms.
Following opposition criticism
, the Bill was referred to a JPC (headed by BJP MP Jagadambika Pal), which reviewed 58 proposed amendments, accepting 14 and rejecting 44.
The amendments cleared by the JPC, and now the Union Cabinet,
address some of the most contentious parts of the Bill.
Key Amendments Approved by the JPC:
Extended time-frame for registration:
initially
required all waqf properties to be registered on a central portal within six months of the law's enactment.
The JPC accepted an amendment
allowing an extension
if the mutawalli (caretaker) provides a valid reason for the delay.
The Waqf Tribunal
will have the power to grant such extensions, though no fixed timeline has been specified.
Another amendment extends the deadline for waqfs to file legal proceedings even if not registered on the portal,
provided an affidavit explaining the delay is submitted
Role of district collector in dispute resolution:
The 2024 Bill
originally
transferred the power of determining government property claims from the Waqf Tribunal to the
District Collector.
The JPC modified this provision, accepting amendments to
replace the District Collector with a designated senior state government officer.
The so-called
“designated officer”
will be responsible for making necessary changes to the revenue records, if a property is deemed to be a government property and not a Waqf property.
Until a final decision is made
, disputed property will continue to be treated as government property.
Changes in Waqf Board representation:
The 2024 Bill proposed allowing a non-Muslim Chief Executive Officer, and at least two non-Muslim members to be appointed by the state government to the waqf boards at the state level.
The JPC amended this, ensuring that the government official in the Board must be
a Joint Secretary-level officer
dealing with Waqf matters.
Another amendment mandates the inclusion of a member in the Waqf
expertise in Muslim law and jurisprudence.
The previous version
of the Waqf Bill proposed that the tribunal have a sitting or retired district judge (as chairperson), and a Joint Secretary-level officer of the state government (as a member).
Conclusion:
aim to balance
government oversight with waqf autonomy,
addressing concerns regarding property disputes, legal recourse, and representation on waqf boards.
The revised Bill is expected to be debated in Parliament soon, where
further discussions may shape its final implementation.

but rather the risk that excessive regulations might slow down India’s momentum.
To maintain its competitive edge,
India must navigate the complexities of AI adoption, regulatory pressures, and global market dynamics with strategic foresight.
Challenges to AI Adoption in India
Workforce Displacement and Job Security
One of the biggest concerns surrounding AI adoption in India is the
fear of large-scale job displacement.
India’s economy is
heavily reliant on the service sector,
particularly IT, customer support, and business process outsourcing (BPO), where millions of workers are employed in repetitive, routine tasks.
AI-powered automation threatens to replace these jobs
, leading to widespread unemployment if workers are not reskilled for emerging AI-driven roles.
Data Privacy, Bias, and Ethical Concerns
The rapid deployment of AI in various sectors brings
concerns related to data privacy and algorithmic bias.
AI systems
rely on large datasets to function effectively
, but India lacks strong data privacy protections compared to developed economies.
Personal Data Protection Bill,
India’s equivalent of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
has faced delays and revisions
, leaving AI firms in a regulatory grey area.
Moreover,
AI systems are prone to biases
, particularly when trained on incomplete or skewed datasets.
In a diverse country like India,
biased algorithms can lead to discrimination
against marginalised communities.
Foreign Dominance and Market Competition
Indian AI startups and enterprises f
ace significant challenges in competing with global technology giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon
, which dominate AI research, cloud computing, and software services.
These
foreign companies have greater access to cutting-edge AI models,
computing resources, and financial backing, making it difficult for Indian firms to establish themselves in the global AI market.
Additionally,
foreign AI firms often dictate the terms of engagement,
creating monopolistic barriers that prevent Indian companies from growing.
recent example
of this is the complaint filed by Indian app developers against Google, accusing the company of anti-competitive practices.
Regulatory and Legal Uncertainty
AI development and deployment in India are
hindered by unclear and sometimes conflicting regulations.
Unlike the European Union, which has implemented strict AI governance laws, and the United States, which follows a more innovation-friendly approach,
India’s regulatory stance on AI remains ambiguous.
Various government agencies have introduced
different guidelines,
leading to a fragmented policy landscape that creates confusion among businesses and investors.
One major challenge is
intermediary liability,
which determines who is responsible for AI-generated decisions and content.
Social media platforms
, e-commerce websites, and financial institutions use AI-driven algorithms to
filter content,
recommend products, and assess creditworthiness.
Public Trust and Resistance to AI Adoption
Despite AI’s potential to enhance productivity and innovation,
public perception of AI in India remains mixed.
Many people view AI with scepticism
, fearing job losses, privacy breaches, and government surveillance.
Resistance to AI adoption is particularly strong in traditional industries such as manufacturing, agriculture,
and small businesses, where automation is perceived as a threat rather than an opportunity.
India’s Position in the Global AI Race
India enjoys a
unique advantage as a global IT powerhouse
. However, the global AI race presents contrasting regulatory approaches that India must carefully navigate.
The European Union (EU) has opted for strict AI regulations, focusing on societal risks and human rights concerns.
In contrast,
the United States follows a more laissez-faire approach
, emphasising innovation over regulation.
While India has previously drawn inspiration from EU and U.S.
policies,
it must now forge its own path.
The EU’s strict AI laws stem from its structural deficiencies, such as the lack of a supranational constitution to safeguard against AI-based surveillance.
India does not face the same issue and, therefore, does not need to adopt the same regulatory approach
Instead, it
must prioritise its national interests,
ensuring that its services-driven IT sector is not hampered by unnecessary legal barriers.
Steps that Will Shape India’s Ambition
The Need for Regulatory Clarity
While AI adoption must be rapid to maintain India’s competitive edge,
regulatory clarity is essential.
At present,
India’s AI policy landscape is fragmented
, with different agencies proposing conflicting guidelines.
To avoid legal uncertainty,
policymakers should focus on strengthening existing laws rather than introducing new ones.
Lessons from the EU and U.S. indicate that
AI can be effectively governed by adapting current legislation.
India already has a robust legal framework
covering antitrust laws, corporate liability, free speech, and public order, which can be extended to AI governance.
Instead of drafting AI-specific laws,
India should ensure that its existing regulatory structure is well-equipped to address AI-related challenges.
Strike a Balance between Innovation and Regulation
India’s priority should be
to encourage rapid AI adoption while ensuring open-source accessibility and flexible technological frameworks.
country’s long-term success in the AI sector depends on its ability to strike a balance between innovation and regulation,
enabling its IT industry to thrive in the global marketplace.
Conclusion
India stands at a pivotal moment in the AI revolution
, where its choices today will determine its place in the global digital economy.
While regulatory concerns must be addressed,
excessive restrictions could impede growth and push businesses elsewhere.
India should focus on fostering an AI-friendly ecosystem,
leveraging its IT strengths, and ensuring that AI adoption aligns with national interests.
By pursuing strategic international partnerships, maintaining regulatory flexibility,
and supporting AI-driven innovation,
India can secure its leadership in the global AI race.

Editorial Analysis
**********The Necessity of Mainstreaming Wetland Conservation
Context
Wetlands are among the
most biologically productive ecosystems on Earth
, providing essential ecological, economic, and social benefits.
However,
their rapid degradation due to human activities and climate change has become a significant environmental concern.
recent Suo Motu public interest litigation by the Meghalaya High Court
to monitor wetland conservation in the state has
once again brought attention to this crucial issue.
Significance of Wetlands
invaluable ecosystems that support biodiversity
, regulate water cycles, and act as carbon sinks.
Globally, wetlands cover approximately 12.1 million square kilometres
, which accounts for about 6% of the Earth's surface.
Despite their relatively small coverage,
they contribute to nearly 40.6% of global ecosystem services.
These
ecosystems provide critical habitat for numerous species
, help in flood control, purify water, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
In recognition of their importance,
the Ramsar Convention was adopted in 1971 to promote wetland conservation and sustainable use.
Every year,
February 2 is observed as ‘World Wetlands Day’
to raise awareness of wetland preservation.
The 2023 theme, ‘Protecting Wetlands for Our Common Future’, underscores their role in sustainable development
, aligning with the principles outlined in the Brundtland Report (1987), which emphasizes intergenerational environmental responsibility.
Threats to Wetlands
Despite their immense ecological and economic value,
wetlands face severe stress due to human-induced and natural factors.
Studies indicate that
since 1900, nearly 50% of the world’s wetlands have been lost. Between 1970 and 2015 alone,
global wetland surface area declined by about 35%, with an annual loss rate of 0.78%.
This is
more than three times higher than the loss rate of natural vegetation
Some of the major threats include:
Urbanisation and Industrialisation:
The rapid expansion of cities has led to the destruction of wetlands for infrastructure development.
Agricultural Expansion:
Conversion of wetlands for farming reduces biodiversity and disrupts water balance.
Pollution:
Industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural runoff contaminate wetland ecosystems.
Climate Change:
Rising temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns impact wetland hydrology.
Overexploitation of Resources:
Unsustainable fishing, groundwater extraction, and land reclamation degrade wetlands.
loss of wetlands has resulted in the decline of 81% of inland wetland
species and 36% of coastal and marine species since 1970.
extinction risk for both plant and animal species associated with wetlands is increasing globally
, highlighting the urgency of conservation efforts.
Global Conservation Initiatives
The conservation and management of wetlands are
now seen as integral to global sustainability.
14th Conference of the Parties (COP14)
of the Ramsar Convention held in 2022 emphasised the
need for wetlands to be part of broader environmental strategies.
conference stressed that wetland conservation should not be a standalone initiative
but should be linked to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Global Biodiversity Targets, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and climate change mitigation efforts.
impact of biodiversity loss and climate change has become more evident after the COVID-19 pandemic,
making it more urgent to protect wetlands.
Effective implementation of the Ramsar Strategic Plan would contribute significantly to global environmental sustainability.
The Status of Wetlands in India and the Economic Implications
As a signatory to the Ramsar Convention,
India has designated 89 Ramsar sites as wetlands of international importance as of today.
These wetlands span diverse ecosystems, from the coastal regions to the Himalayan territories.
Notably, even some river stretches,
such as the Upper Ganga, are designated as Ramsar sites.
mere identification as a Ramsar site does not guarantee protection.
The National Wetland Decadal Change Atlas (2017-18), prepared by the Space Applications Centre (SAC), highlights that
wetlands in India cover approximately 15.98 million hectares.
Of this, 66.6% are natural wetlands
, while the remaining are man-made.
Unfortunately,
natural wetlands in India are shrinking.
Nearly
30% of India’s natural wetlands have been lost in the last four decades
due to urbanisation, pollution, and encroachment.
Major urban centres have witnessed alarming losses:
Mumbai has lost 71%
of its wetlands from 1970 to 2014.
East Kolkata Wetlands have shrunk by 36%
between 1991 and 2021.
Chennai has lost 85%
of its wetlands, as per a WWF study.
The Economic Implications of Wetland Loss
The economic implications of wetland loss are staggering.
A study in Cali, Colombia, estimated that
the loss of urban wetland ecosystem services amounts to $76,827 per hectare annually
, while the loss in peri-urban areas is $30,354 per hectare annually.
Similar losses can be expected in India, given the rapid rate of wetland degradation.
Key strategies for Wetland Conservation
Integrated Wetland Management:
Aligning wetland conservation with broader environmental and development goals.
Policy and Governance:
Implementing stricter regulations to prevent encroachments and pollution.
Community Involvement:
Encouraging local participation in wetland restoration and protection.
Technology and Research:
Utilising satellite imagery, GIS mapping, and AI to monitor wetland changes.
Climate Change Mitigation:
Recognizing wetlands as both a source and sink of carbon, making them crucial for climate action.
The Way Forward: The Need for a Holistic Conservation Approach
In India, wetland conservation efforts have primarily focused on ecological and environmental aspects.
a comprehensive approach that integrates social, economic, and governance factors
is necessary.
At the global level,
wetland conservation strategies include biodiversity monitoring, wetland mapping, and human impact assessment.
Ramsar COP14 conference advocated for an ecosystem-based approach to wetland management,
emphasising that wetland conservation
should be embedded within broader urban and rural development plans.
Conclusion
Wetlands play a critical role in sustaining biodiversity
, mitigating climate change, and providing ecosystem services.
While international frameworks like the Ramsar Convention
and national initiatives have made progress in wetland conservation,
the current approach is inadequate.
A more integrated, multi-disciplinary
strategy
involving policy reforms, technological advancements, community engagement, and climate resilience planning
is essential for long-term wetland preservation.

_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
In Bengaluru, Indian developers face tough competition from China for AI projects. To lead the AI race, India must focus on supportive regulations and enhancing technological capabilities.
What are the key issues related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in India?
Job Displacement and Skill Gap:
Increased AI adoption threatens to automate routine jobs, leading to large-scale unemployment and requiring a workforce with advanced digital skills.
Example:
The NASSCOM report (2023) highlighted that 69% of Indian tech workers need to upskill in AI and machine learning to remain employable as automation rises.
Algorithmic Bias and Ethical Concerns:
AI systems can reflect and amplify societal biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in hiring, lending, and public services.
In 2023, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) faced criticism when its AI-based screening system allegedly disadvantaged candidates from marginalized backgrounds during preliminary evaluations.
Misinformation and Deepfake Threats:
AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes undermine public trust, pose security risks, and impact democratic processes.
During the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, deepfake videos impersonating political leaders circulated widely on social media, raising concerns about election manipulation.
Regulatory Uncertainty and Compliance Costs:
The lack of a unified AI policy and fragmented regulations create legal ambiguity, increasing compliance burdens for Indian startups.
In 2023, Indian app developers filed a complaint with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) against Google for restrictive AI-related practices on the Play Store, citing unfair competition.
Global Competitiveness and Innovation Lag:
Over-regulation and high compliance costs could hinder AI innovation, making India less competitive against global leaders like the U.S. and China.
India’s AI startup investments lag behind China and the U.S., with China attracting four times more AI funding in 2023, according to a Stanford AI Index report.
Where does India stand in the global Artificial Intelligence (AI) race?
Emerging AI Hub with Growing Investments:
India is positioning itself as an emerging AI hub with increasing investments in AI research and development, but it still lags behind global leaders like the U.S. and China.
According to the
Stanford AI Index Report 2023
, India ranked fifth globally in AI research output but attracted significantly less AI funding compared to China and the U.S.
Government Initiatives to Boost AI Innovation:
India has launched several initiatives to promote AI adoption, such as the “National Program on AI” and the establishment of AI research centers to enhance innovation and application.
In 2023, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) introduced the “IndiaAI” mission to promote AI-based solutions in healthcare, agriculture, and education.
Challenges in Global Competitiveness:
Despite having a large talent pool, India faces challenges in scaling AI innovation due to fragmented regulations, limited high-performance computing resources, and competition from advanced economies.
While India produced over 20,000 AI and machine learning professionals in 2023, its AI exports remain limited compared to China’s dominance in AI-driven hardware and cloud solutions.
What is the current regulatory framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Existing Laws Governing AI Use:
India does not have a dedicated AI law but regulates AI through existing legal frameworks like the
Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000
, which governs data protection, cybersecurity, and intermediary liability.
Sector-Specific Guidelines:
Various government bodies have issued guidelines for AI applications in specific sectors. For example:
RBI Guidelines
for AI in financial services (e.g., credit scoring) and
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)
recommendations on AI in data privacy and telecommunications.
National Strategy on AI:
The government launched the
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence
(NITI Aayog, 2018) to guide AI research, ethical standards, and public-sector AI deployment.
Under the
IndiaAI Mission
(2023), the government aims to promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation across industries.
Competition and Data Protection Framework:
monitors anti-competitive practices by tech firms using AI algorithms. The
Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
regulates how AI systems process personal data.
In 2023, the CCI investigated Google for alleged AI-related anti-competitive practices on the Play Store.
AI Ethics and Responsible Use:
Guidelines on the ethical use of AI emphasize transparency, fairness, and accountability without imposing ex-ante (preemptive) regulation.
Ministry of Electronics and IT
(MeitY) released advisory notes on preventing algorithmic bias and ensuring explainability in AI decisions.
Way forward:
Comprehensive AI Policy Framework:
Establish a unified and adaptive AI policy focusing on ethical guidelines, data privacy, and accountability to balance innovation with public interest.
Investment in AI Infrastructure and Skill Development:
Enhance funding for AI research, expand high-performance computing resources, and implement large-scale reskilling programs to bridge the skill gap and improve global competitiveness.
**********The SEC and Hague Service Convention
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Hague Service Convention;
Why in the News?
On February 18, 2025, the U.S. Secuirty and Exchange commission asked the Indian government under the Hague Service Convention, to serve summons on Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani in a securities and wire fraud case.
What is the Hague Service Convention?
, formally known as the
Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters (1965)
, is a
multilateral treaty
that facilitates the
service of legal documents
across international borders in civil and commercial cases.
How does it function?
standardizes the process for serving legal documents across borders in
matters.
It operates through
Central Authorities
in member countries, ensuring
efficient service
, protecting
defendants’ rights
, and allowing
alternative methods
like postal service if permitted. It excludes
criminal cases
and non-signatory nations.
How is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission attempting to serve summons on the Adanis?
Invoking the Hague Service Convention:
The SEC has requested assistance from
India’s Ministry of Law and Justice
Article 5(a)
of the

Exploring Alternative Service Methods:
The SEC is considering
Rule 4(f) of the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
, which allows service through means like
email
social media
, if conventional methods face delays.
Proceeding Despite FCPA Suspension:
Although the
Trump administration
has temporarily paused the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)

**********Counting matters: On delimitation, federalism, the Census
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of delimitation exercise;
Why in the News?
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has called for an all-party meeting on March 5 to discuss the delimitation exercise, aiming to start a national discussion on the issue.
What is the primary concern of Tamil Nadu regarding the delimitation exercise?
Loss of Parliamentary Representation:
Tamil Nadu fears that if
is based solely on population size, it may lose
Lok Sabha seats
due to its
lower population growth
compared to northern States. For instance, while
Tamil Nadu’s electorate grew by 171% (1971-2024)
undivided Bihar’s grew by 233%
, which could lead to a reduction in Tamil Nadu’s political influence.
Penalty for Population Control Success:
Tamil Nadu is concerned that its
effective population control measures
will be penalized. States with
higher fertility rates
(e.g.,
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar
) might gain seats, while those with
lower growth
like Tamil Nadu and
Kerala
could lose out, despite their better
health and development indicators
What are the potential impacts of the delimitation exercise?
Shift in Political Power Dynamics:
Delimitation could increase the number of representatives from
with higher populations (e.g.,
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
), thereby shifting political influence away from
southern and western
States that have implemented effective population control measures.
Federal Imbalance and Regional Inequality:
Southern states that perform better in terms of
health, education, and population control
may feel penalized. For example,
Kerala’s
successful population policies could lead to fewer seats despite its contributions to national development, undermining the principle of
cooperative federalism
Resource Allocation Disparities:
More seats for northern States could lead to greater influence over
Union Budget allocations
central schemes
, potentially reducing the share of resources to States with fewer representatives like
Karnataka
Andhra Pradesh
Political Tensions and Regional Discontent:
Perceived favoritism towards northern States could increase
regional tensions
. For example, Tamil Nadu’s call for an
reflects concerns that their voices will be marginalized, which may fuel
political agitation
and demands for policy reassessment.
Why was the delimitation exercise frozen based on the 1971 Census?
To Ensure Fairness Among States with Varying Population Growth:
This aimed to protect the
political representation
of States that successfully implemented
population control policies
Example:
Southern States like
have lower population growth but would lose seats if delimitation were updated, while
would gain due to their higher population increases.
To Maintain the Balance of Power in Federal Governance:
The freeze ensured that the
distribution of parliamentary seats
did not disrupt the
federal structure
by over-representing certain regions. This preserved a
geographical balance
in national decision-making.
Despite
slower population growth, its
39 Lok Sabha seats
remain unchanged since 1971, allowing it to maintain a significant voice in national policies.
What steps has the Union government taken to clarify its position on maintaining proportional representation for Southern States?
Delimitation Freeze Extension
: The government extended the freeze on parliamentary seat allocation based on population through the
42nd Amendment (1976)
until
2001
, and later extended it to
2026
84th Amendment (2001)
Equitable Resource Allocation
15th Finance Commission (2021-26)
used a balanced approach by including both

to ensure fair distribution of resources, addressing concerns of Southern states.
: The Commission allocated
12.5% weightage
for demographic performance, rewarding states with better population control.
Consultative Processes
: The Union government engages with Southern states through
inter-state council meetings
Finance Commission consultations
to address their concerns about fair representation and resource distribution.
: In
2023
, the government held deliberations on the implications of delimitation and reassured Southern states of equitable consideration in future seat revisions.
Way forward:
Balanced Delimitation Framework:
Implement a
hybrid approach
that considers both
to ensure fair representation without penalizing states with successful population control policies.
Strengthen Federal Dialogue:
Regular
consultative mechanisms
Inter-State Councils

Why in the News?
Recent sightings of the rare
oarfish
, also known as the
“Doomsday Fish,”
near the shores of
Baja California Sur, Mexico
, have sparked speculation and social media frenzy.
About the ‘Doomsday Fish’
Japanese Folklore
calls the oarfish
“Ryugu no tsukai”
“Sea God’s Palace Messenger”
and believes its rare appearance signals an impending natural calamity.
The belief
gained strength in 2011
when
multiple oarfish washed ashore in Japan
just before the
Tohoku earthquake and tsunami
(9.0 magnitude).
Some cultures also consider the oarfish a
messenger of the deep
, warning humans of major disturbances in the ocean.
Popular Legends
Some scientists suggest that deep-sea fishlike oarfish may be sensitive to
underwater vibrations
from fault lines and could surface
before an earthquake
However, no conclusive scientific evidence supports this theory.
Powerful
ocean currents, storms, or underwater disturbances
may push weakened or dying oarfish toward the surface.
El Niño phenomenon
or changes in water temperature might also affect their movements.
2019 study in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America
found
no relationship
between oarfish sightings and earthquakes in Japan.
