What is the Case Background?
SC Guidelines on Demolition Procedures
SC’s Reasoning Behind the Guidelines
Demolition Laws and Practices Across Indian States
Impact of the SC’s Verdict
Conclusion
Exercising its powers under
Article 142
of the Constitution, the Supreme Court laid down a series of guidelines to ensure that due process is followed for demolishing the properties of citizens accused of crimes.
This ruling comes after a series of cases in which state authorities allegedly demolished properties as a punitive measure, a practice referred to by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) as “
bulldozer justice
.”
The SC's verdict addressed pleas challenging the practice of demolishing homes of individuals accused of criminal activities.
This practice, seen in states like
UP, MP, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan
, has often led to
accusations of bias and lack of due process
The ruling was prompted by recent cases in Ratlam (MP) and Udaipur (Rajasthan), where
demolitions were linked to allegations against family members involved in communal or criminal incidents
SC Guidelines on Demolition Procedures:
Mandatory notice period:
The Court mandates that
a minimum of 15 days’ notice
must be given to the property owner or occupier before a demolition.
This notice
must outline the reasons
for demolition and schedule a “personal hearing” to allow property owners a chance to contest.
Hearing and final order:
Authorities must conduct a hearing and document all proceedings.
The final demolition order must include the arguments presented by the owner, the reasons for demolition, and whether full or partial demolition is required.
The Court emphasised that
demolitions should be the last resort
ordered only when deemed absolutely necessary.
Post-order process:
If a final order for demolition is issued,
a 15-day period will follow
to allow the owner time to either remove the structure or appeal in court.
Authorities must also
record a video of the demolition
and prepare an inspection and demolition report listing the personnel involved.
SC’s Reasoning Behind the Guidelines:
Separation of powers:
The Court asserted that the
judiciary, not the executive, is responsible for determining guilt
It emphasised that punishing an accused by demolishing their property without a judicial trial oversteps executive boundaries.
Public trust and accountability:
The Court highlighted the need for transparency, stating that
public officials should be held accountable for misuse of authority
, particularly when demolitions target properties merely because the owner is an accused.
Right to shelter:
The SC noted that demolitions affect not only the accused but also other family members who have a constitutional right to shelter under
Article 21 of the Constitution
The guidelines aim to protect these individuals from losing their homes unjustly.
Demolition Laws and Practices Across Indian States:
Rajasthan:
Under provisions of the Rajasthan Municipalities Act, authorities can confiscate properties that encroach public land, provided they serve a written notice with grounds for confiscation and allow a chance for representation.
MP:
The MP Municipalities Act allows demolition of unauthorised constructions only after serving notice to owners.
UP:
The UP Urban Planning and Development Act mandates that an owner receive a minimum notice period of 15 days before demolition of unauthorised structures. The owner can appeal the order, but once finalised, it cannot be contested in court.
Delhi:
The Delhi Municipal Corporation Act allows removal of unauthorised structures with “reasonable opportunity” for the owner to appeal.
Haryana:
The Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, similar to Delhi’s DMC Act, provides owners a brief period to challenge demolitions but has a shorter window (3 days) to comply with demolition orders.
Impact of the SC’s Verdict:
Providing a path forward:
Affected families hope that the ruling will push local authorities toward providing restitution, either through compensation or through the restoration of demolished properties.
Challenges in implementation:
While the SC’s verdict calls for transparency and accountability,
there are still gaps in ensuring that compensation reaches those already affected
Hence, the future policies must address the issue of restitution, ensuring fair outcomes for those unjustly impacted by “bulldozer justice.”
Conclusion:
By safeguarding the right to shelter and enforcing accountability, the Court aims to prevent “bulldozer justice” and ensure that the government operates within constitutional boundaries.
However, for those who have already lost their homes, the struggle for justice is far from over, as the questions about restitution remain unresolved.
Q.1. What is Bulldozer Justice?
Bulldozer Justice refers to the instant justice mechanism that is propagated by the government of various states to punish the alleged rioters and protestors by razing down their houses, stalls or any construction with the use of JCB.
Q.2. What is Article 142 of the Constitution of India?
Article 142 of the Constitution of India gives the Supreme Court the power to pass any orders or decrees necessary to ensure complete justice in any case before it. This power is known as the Supreme Court's "plenary power".

Inter-State Council
Source: BS
Why in News?
The Indian government has recently reconstituted the
Inter-State Council (ISC)
after two years, with the
last reconstitution in 2022,
appointing the
Prime Minister(PM) as chairman
and underscoring a renewed commitment to
Centre-State relations
cooperative federalism
.
What is the Inter-State Council?
Establishment:
The ISC was constituted to
facilitate Centre-State and Inter-State cooperation
in India.
It was established under
Article 263 of the Constitution
which empowers the
President of India to establish an ISC
for better coordination between States.
Sarkaria Commission (1988)
recommended making the ISC a permanent body, leading to its formal establishment in
1990 through a Presidential Order
Functions of the ISC:
It discusses subjects of common interest to states and the Union and makes recommendations for the coordination of policies and actions.
The ISC also
investigates issues affecting Centre-State and Inter-State relations
to ensure seamless governance.
Composition of the Council:
PM serves as the Chairperson
. Members include
Chief Ministers(CMs) of all States,
CMs of Union Territories
having a Legislative Assembly and Administrators of UTs not having a Legislative Assembly, and
6 Union Ministers of Cabinet rank, nominated by the Prime Minister,
are also part of the ISC.
The Presidential Order of 1990 has been amended twice, first in 1990 and then in 1996, to allow the
Governor
of a State under President's rule
to attend the meeting of the ISC and for the
Chairman to nominate permanent invitees
from amongst the other Union Ministers, respectively.
In the second meeting of the ISC held in 1996, the Council decided to set up a
Standing Committee for continuous consultation
and processing of matters for consideration of the Council.
Accordingly, a Standing Committee was set up under the
Chairmanship of the Home Minister
and has been reconstituted from time to time with the approval of the Chairman of the Council.
Secretariat:
Inter-State Council Secretariat(ISCS)
in New Delhi was established in 1991 and is headed by a
Secretary to the Government of India
The secretarial functions of the
Zonal Councils
have been transferred to the ISCS since 2011.
Benefits:
Policies developed through ISC deliberation would hold
greater social legitimacy,
enhancing acceptance among states and reducing friction.
The ISC maintains the
balance of power between the Union and states,
preventing dominance by either side. It ensures that Union decisions align with the
constitutional framework and federal principles,
especially during reforms like
Goods and Services Tax (GST)
demonetization
that may strain Union-state relations.
What are the Challenges Regarding the Inter-State Council?
Infrequent Meetings:
Despite its purpose, the ISC has been criticised for irregular meetings, having met only
11 times since its establishment in 1990
The procedure mandates that it
should meet at least three times a year,
but the last meeting was held in
July 2016
Non-Binding Recommendations:
The ISC faces key challenges due to its
advisory and non-binding nature,
which limits its impact on resolving disputes and hinders effective Union-State coordination.
Its
broad mandate lacks enforcement authority,
making it more a discussion forum than a decision-making body.
Additionally, there is often a
lack of robust follow-up mechanisms
to ensure that recommendations are
tracked and implemented,
necessitating a more structured approach for meaningful outcomes.
Political Dynamics:
The political landscape can influence the functioning of the ISC.
Differences in political ideologies between the central and state governments
can affect the council's ability to reach consensus on various issues.
What Reforms are Needed for ISC to Function Effectively?
Amendment of Article 263:
Punchhi Commission (2010)
emphasised making the ISC a specialised body to address intergovernmental relations and federal challenges.
Amending
Article 263 to strengthen the ISC’s mandate
for addressing both inter-state and Union-state issues could enhance its role as a consultative and decision-making forum.
Regular and Timely Meetings:
Reviving the mandate for regular meetings could foster continuity in discussions and provide states with a regular platform for policy input.
Clear Agenda and Priorities:
Establish a clear agenda and set of priorities for each meeting, focusing on pressing inter-state issues such as
water disputes, infrastructure development, and economic cooperation.
Technology Integration:
Utilise digital tools and platforms to facilitate communication, data sharing, and decision-making processes within the ISC, making it more efficient and responsive.
Conclusion
To truly strengthen India’s federal framework, the Inter-State Council needs to evolve from a
largely advisory body into a more proactive and empowered institution
. Reforms like enhancing its mandate and ensuring regular, outcome-driven meetings will be crucial in fostering deeper cooperation and resolving the complexities of Centre-State relations.
Drishti Mains Question
Discuss the role and significance of the Inter-State Council  in maintaining cooperative federalism in India. How effective has it been in addressing Centre-State issues?

November
to raise awareness about the
vital role
vaccines
play in preventing
infectious diseases
and protecting public health.
Immunisation is making a person r
esistant to an infectious disease
by administering a vaccine to stimulate the
immune system
What are the Key Facts About Immunisation in India?
Key Immunisation Programs in India:
Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)
: Initially launched as the
Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1978
, it was rebranded as the
in 1985
when coverage expanded from
urban to rural areas.
1992
, the UIP was incorporated into the
Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Programme
and later, in
1997

About Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002
Major Provisions of the Act
News Summary
The Supreme Court, in its ruling on November 6th, for the very first time mandated that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) need to obtain prior sanction to prosecute public servants on money laundering charges.
was enacted in January, 2003.
The Act seeks to combat money laundering in India and has three main objectives
To prevent and control money laundering
To confiscate and seize the property obtained from the laundered money; and
To deal with any other issue connected with money laundering in India.
Sec. 3
of the Act defines offence of money laundering as:
whosoever directly or indirectly attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting it as untainted property shall be guilty of offence of money-laundering
The Act was amended by the
Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2009
and by the
Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act, 2012
The Act prescribes obligation of banking companies, financial institutions and intermediaries for verification and maintenance of records of the identity of all its clients and also of all transactions.
PMLA empowers the
Directorate of Enforcement
(ED) to carry out investigations in cases involving offence of money laundering and also to attach the property involved in money laundering.
ED is a law enforcement agency and economic intelligence agency responsible for enforcing economic laws and fighting economic crime in India.
It was formed as an Enforcement Unit, in the Department of Economic Affairs, for handling Exchange Control Laws violations under
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947
PMLA envisages setting up of an
Adjudicating Authority
to exercise jurisdiction, power and authority conferred by it essentially to confirm attachment or order confiscation of attached properties.
It also envisages setting up of an
Appellate Tribunal
to hear appeals against the order of the Adjudicating Authority
PMLA envisages designation of one or more courts of sessions as
Special Court
or Special Courts to try the offences punishable under the Act.
PMLA also allows Central Government to enter into an agreement with Government of any country outside India for enforcing the provisions of the PMLA
Delhi’s former Chief Minister
Arvind Kejriwal
and Congress MP
P. Chidambaram
have sought relief from their respective trials, citing a
recent Supreme Court ruling
as precedent.
While the Delhi High Court is yet to decide on Kejriwal’s plea related to the
excise policy scam
, Chidambaram’s trial in the Aircel-Maxis case was stayed on
November 20
Supreme Court Precedent (November 6, 2023):
The SC ruled for the first time that
prior government sanction
is mandatory for prosecuting public servants under the
if the alleged offenses are linked to their official duties.
This is based on
Section 197
Understanding the Legal Framework:
Prior Sanction Provision:
CrPC Section 197
: Courts cannot take cognizance of offenses committed by public servants in their official capacity unless prior government approval is obtained.
Exceptions
: No sanction is required for certain grave offenses like sexual harassment, trafficking, or rape.
Landmark Case
: In
Devinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2016)
, the SC clarified that this provision does not shield corrupt activities disguised as official duties.
Supreme Court’s Recent Decision:
The SC upheld the 2019 Telangana High Court ruling, which overturned the trial court’s cognizance of charges against IAS officers Bibhu Prasad Acharya and Adityanath Das in a money laundering case linked to former Andhra Pradesh CM
Jagan Mohan Reddy
PMLA Provisions and CrPC Compatibility
: Section 65 of the PMLA aligns with CrPC Section 197, requiring prior sanction for public servants.
Link to Official Duty
: The accused’s duties and alleged criminal acts were connected, necessitating prior sanction.
Application to Current Cases:
Chidambaram’s Case
: He argued that the trial court’s cognizance of chargesheets filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) violated this precedent, as no prior sanction was obtained.
Kejriwal’s Case
: He similarly challenged the cognizance of an ED chargesheet in the
liquor policy scam
, citing that even the CBI obtained prior sanction for similar allegations.
Impact of the Prior Sanction Requirement:
Implications for ED Cases
Investigations under the PMLA remain valid, but trial courts cannot take cognizance of chargesheets against public servants without prior sanction.
Convictions could be overturned on appeal if the absence of prior sanction is established.
Public servants can raise this argument at any stage of the trial, even post-conviction (
P K Pradhan v. State of Sikkim
, 2001
).
Challenges to Prosecution
Prosecution agencies may face delays as they must secure government approvals before moving forward with cases.
Significance of the Ruling:
Shield for Public Servants
The provision
aims to protect honest officials performing their duties from frivolous prosecutions
while ensuring accountability for misconduct.
Political and Administrative Ramifications
High-profile figures like Kejriwal and Chidambaram are leveraging this provision to contest trial proceedings.
The ruling sets a critical precedent for cases involving public servants under the PMLA.
Q1. What is Money Laundering?
Money laundering is the process of illegally concealing the origin of money obtained from illicit activities such as drug trafficking, underground sex work, terrorism, corruption, embezzlement, and gambling, and converting the funds into a seemingly legitimate source, usually through a front organization.
Q2. What is Hawala?
Hawala is an informal funds transfer system that allows for the shifting of money from one person to another without the actual movement of money. It is a simple process that requires no documentation and, therefore, is an anonymous system of moving money.

Limit on Private Property Acquisition
Source: HT
Why in News?
Recently, the Supreme Court in the
Property Owners Association v State of Maharashtra Case 2024
, set limits on the government’s power to take over
privately owned resources for
public distribution
.
The petitioners argued that private properties cannot be taken over by the state under the garb of constitutional schemes of
Articles 39(b) and 31C
of the Constitution.
What are the Key Highlights of the Supreme Court Verdict?
Acquisition of Private Resources
: Resources that are
scarce or vital to community well-being
should qualify for state acquisition and not all private properties.
“Public trust doctrine”
where the state holds certain resources in trust for the public,
might guide this determination
Tests for Resource Qualification
: The court laid down
two key tests
i.e., a resource must be both
“material” and “belong to or serve the community.
materiality
of a privately owned resource and its community element must be assessed on a
case-by-case basis.
Materiality refers to the impact of assets like
land, minerals, or water
economic, social, and environmental dynamics
Overturning Ranganath Reddy case 1977:
The majority overturned the
Sanjeev Coke ruling
1982
which had upheld
argument in the Ranganath Reddy case that all private property could be deemed "material resources of the community" for redistribution.
lone dissenter
Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia
argued for broader legislative discretion
in defining “material resources” of the community.
Restriction on Article 39(b):
The court cautioning against a wider
interpretation
that would undermine property rights under
Article 300A
Article 300A:
No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.
Private to Community Resources:
SC outlined
five ways
of turning private resources into community material resources:
Nationalisation, Acquisition, Operation of law, Purchase by the state and Donation by the owner.
What are the Constitutional Provisions Related to Right to Property?
Article 31:
original Article 31
(a fundamental right)
dealt with the
right to property
, but it was repealed (
44
Amendment Act, 1978)
and replaced by
Article 300A (constitutional right).
Amendment Act, 1951:
The 1
Amendment Act, 1951 incorporated
Articles 31A and 31B
into the Constitution, along with the
Ninth Schedule
Articles 31A:
It gave the state competence to
acquire property or alter rights in property
without it being challenged on grounds of inconsistency with fundamental rights.
Article 31B:
It ensured that laws included in the
could not be struck down, even if they conflicted with fundamental rights.
Ninth Schedule:
It contains a list of
central and state laws
which cannot be challenged in courts. E.g.,
land reform laws.
25
Amendment Act, 1971:
It inserted
Article 31C
to protect state laws aimed at resource distribution under
Article 39(b) and (c)
from constitutional challenges.
The Amendment
barred the courts
from reviewing the State’s actions, even if they were
arbitrary or irrational
42
Amendment Act, 1976:
expanded
the scope of
to include
Directive Principles
This provision protects qualifying laws from being struck down under
Articles 14 and 19
if they genuinely serve public welfare through resource redistribution.
Amendment Act, 1978:
Article 19(1)(f)
, which protected the right to
acquire, hold, and dispose
of property, were
abrogated
meaning it removed the Right to Property from the list of fundamental rights.
Property became a
Chapter IV of Part XII
What is the Significance of the SC Judgment?
State and Individual Rights:
It preserves the potential for state intervention while acknowledging that the indiscriminate acquisition of private resources is not permissible.
Economic Democracy:
The judgement aligns with
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s vision of "economic democracy,"
ensuring that the Constitution does not dictate a rigid economic structure, thus preserving people's liberty to decide their social and economic organisation.
Flexible Interpretation:
It emphasises that
Directive Principles like Article 39(b)
should be implemented in a way that reflects evolving societal and economic realities and not a single rigid economic doctrine.
Legislative Framework:
The judgement reinforces the role of elected governments and the democratic process in shaping economic and welfare policies.
Welfare:
Future welfare policies will likely focus on scarce, critical resources essential for public welfare. The state may adopt more targeted welfare strategies, such as progressive taxation and public schemes.
Conclusion
The Supreme Court's verdict in the
Property Owners Association v. State of Maharashtra
(2024) sets important precedents regarding the
state’s power
to acquire
. It emphasises the need for
public purpose
compensation
case-by-case assessments
, balancing
individual property rights
common good

Q.
Discuss judicial interpretation of the right to property in various landmark cases.

SC Upholds UP Madarsa Act 2004
Source: BS
Why in News?
Recently, the
Supreme Court
partially upheld the constitutional validity of the
Uttar Pradesh Madrasa Education Board Act, 2004,
overturning the
Allahabad High Court ruling (March 2024)
which declared it
unconstitutional.
However, the SC declared the Provisions pertaining to
higher education
(Kamil and Fazil)
as they conflict with the
University Grants Commission Act (UGC Act) 1956
which is governed by
Entry 66 of List 1.
Why has the Supreme Court Upheld the UP Madrasa Education Board Act, 2004?
Constitutional Validity
: The Madrasa Act, 2004
effectively regulates
the standards of education which aligns with the
state’s obligation
to ensure that students achieve a level of competency to participate actively in society.
Legislative Competence:
The Supreme Court affirmed that the Madarsa Act falls within the legislative competence of the
State Legislature,
specifically under
Entry 25 of List 3
(Concurrent List
) of the Constitution.
Religious Education vs Religious Instruction:
The Court distinguished between
religious educatio
n and
religious instruction.
The Court in
Ms. Aruna Roy vs Union of India, 2002
defined
religious education
as promoting
communal harmony is permissible
, while
religious instruction,
like
mandatory worship
, is prohibited in state-recognised institutions under
Article 28.
Immunity to Basic Structure
: The constitutional validity of a statute cannot be challenged for the violation of the
of the Constitution (
Indira Nehru Gandhi vs Raj Narain Case, 1975)
, the statute must
violate the Constitutional provisions
pertaining to secularism to declare it unconstitutional.
Allowing courts to strike down legislation for violating
undefined concepts like
democracy,
federalism
, and
introduces
uncertainty
in constitutional adjudication.
State Regulation

Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme
Source: BS
Why in News?
The
Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS)
remains a debated topic in India, with proponents arguing it empowers representatives to address local needs and critics claiming it undermines constitutional principles, particularly the
separation of powers.
Recent reports of
incomplete projects and calls for increased funding
have further fueled the debate on the oversight and accountability of MPLADS.
What is MPLADS?
About:
MPLADS is a
Central Sector Scheme
introduced in 1993 that enables the
Members of Parliaments (MP)
to recommend developmental work in their constituencies with an emphasis on creating durable community assets based on locally felt needs.
Implementation:
A state-level nodal department oversees MPLADS, while
district authorities sanction projects
, allocate funds, and ensure implementation.
Funding Allocation:
Each
MP is allocated Rs 5 crore per year
since 2011-12. Funds are disbursed by the
Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MoSPI)
to district authorities in two instalments of Rs 2.5 crore each.
Nature of Funds:
non-lapsable and carried forward
if not utilised in a given year. MPs must allocate a minimum of 15% and 7.5% of their funds to create assets for
Scheduled Castes (SCs)
Scheduled Tribes (STs),
respectively.
Special Provisions:
MPs can allocate up to
Rs 25 lakh annually outside their constituencies or states
for projects promoting national unity. For severe natural calamities, MPs can allocate up to Rs 1 crore for projects anywhere in India.
Projects Eligible Under MPLADS:
MPLADS funds can be converged with the
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)
for durable asset creation and integrated with the
Khelo India program
for sports infrastructure development.
Infrastructure support is permitted on lands owned by
registered societies or trusts
engaged in social welfare for at least three years, but
prohibited for societies where the MP or their family members
are office-bearers.
What are the Main Arguments For and Against MPLADS?
Criticisms:
Violation of Constitutional Principles:
Critics argue that MPLADS breaches the
by allowing legislators to perform executive functions.
While MPs claim to only recommend projects, there are concerns that
district authorities rarely defy MP recommendations,
raising questions about accountability and the separation of powers in democratic governance.
Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) (2005)
recommended the abrogation of the scheme, highlighting the problems of the legislator stepping into the
shoes of the executive
infringe on the rights of
local governments.
Lack of Accountability:
Concerns include inadequate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, leading to
potential misuse of public funds.
It is widely alleged that MPs use these funds to benefit opinion-makers, contractors, or even family members.
The MPLADS scheme is not
governed by any statutory law,
which has made it challenging to enforce the rules and regulations associated with it.
Political Misuse:
Reports suggest that investigations into fund utilisation are often politically motivated, especially during election periods.
Issues in MPLADS:
Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)
has reported multiple flaws in the scheme's execution:
Funds under MPLADS are often underutilised, with utilisation rates ranging from 49% to 90%.
Instead of
funding new asset creation,
a significant portion of the funds was used for the improvement of existing assets.
Excess payments and substandard works due to use of lesser materials have been observed.
Delay in
issuing work orders and poor record-keeping
have further compounded the issue, raising concerns about transparency and accountability.
Supportive Views:
Local Development Focus:
Supporters, primarily elected representatives, believe MPLADS serves as a tool for
localised development,
enabling MPs to respond directly to the needs of their communities.
Flexibility in Project Selection:
Elected representatives argue that MPLADS supports
faster implementation of projects
that reflect local priorities.
Increased Allocation Demand:
Some MPs are advocating for increased
MPLADS funding,
arguing that the current per capita allocation is lower than what state legislators (
Member of the Legislative Assembly
receive for smaller populations.
It is believed that this increase would enable
more equitable development across larger MP constituencies,
aligning resources with those available to MLAs.
How Effective is the Monitoring of MPLADS?
Third-Party Evaluations:
The government has attempted to evaluate MPLADS through third-party monitoring. Organisations like
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development
Consultancy Services (NABCONS)
Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC)
Limited have highlighted some positive outcomes, such as creating good-quality assets and providing decentralised development.
However, the third-party evaluations also revealed irregularities such as
sanction of ineligible works, encroachment of assets, non-existence of some assets,
diversion of use of assets, delay in financial sanction and completion of works, and works awarded to ineligible trusts/societies.
Key Problems in Monitoring MPLADS:
Third-party evaluations are often delayed, leaving little room for corrective actions during project execution.
Insufficient checks and
lack of follow-up on irregularities
allow misuse of funds.
Opaque processes and
limited public access to fund utilisation data
hinder scrutiny.
Each MP's office has the exact details of the fund utilisation over the last 10 years, but
this information has not been updated on the portal
as it was supposed to be.
Does MPLADS Require Reform or Abolition?
Arguments for Reform:
Reforming the MPLADS could involve giving it
statutory backing and establishing an independent monitoring body.
This would ensure better governance, accountability, and transparency, addressing concerns about misuse and inefficiency.
Open tendering
can be used for contractor selection, with CAG representatives present to ensure compliance.
There could be reforms that enable better integration with national schemes like the MGNREGS and
Pradhan Mantri-Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN) Scheme
to maximise the impact of funds.
The current scheme allows MPs to fund various projects, but reforms could
focus on targeting welfare initiatives
for marginalised communities to enhance local development.
Arguments for Abolition:
Abolishing MPLADS could
redirect funds directly to local governments (Panchayats, Municipalities),
which are better positioned to understand and address the specific needs of the community.
Many argue that existing government schemes already address local development needs, and abolishing MPLADS could lead to better utilisation of resources and
prevent duplication of efforts.
The weak regulations have led to misuse and uneven distribution of funds, leaving it vulnerable to
corruption
Conclusion
Balancing MPLADS’s development objectives with
robust accountability mechanisms could determine its future
. Whether reforms to enhance transparency will suffice or whether more drastic measures like abolition are required remains a vital point of debate in India’s democratic governance.
Drishti Mains Question:
What are the issues associated with the MPLADS scheme? How does it challenge the separation of powers?

Comparative Analysis of Indian and US Presidents
Source: IE
Why in News?
The
United States
is all set to elect the country’s next President in its
2024
general election
, with voting through the
Electoral College
scheduled for
5
November, 2024.
This election drew attention to the
similarities and differences
in the
powers and roles
of the Presidents of the US and India..
What is the Electoral College System in the US?
About:
It is the system used in US presidential elections to
formally elect the president and vice president.
The citizens cast their votes not directly for the president, but for a
group of electors
chosen by each candidate’s political party in each state.
These electors then
convene to formally cast their votes for president and vice president
in a process known as the Electoral College.
Emergence:
It was a
settlement
in the US Constitution, balancing between a
direct popular vote and selection by Congress
for electing the president.
It served as a safeguard to prevent the president from appealing directly to the masses and to check executive power through an
intermediary body.
Composition:
It has
538 electors
in total. A candidate needs a majority of
270 electoral votes
to win the presidency.
Impact of Electoral College:
A candidate who
wins the national popular vote may still lose the presidency
if electors vote against the citizens’ choice in the Electoral College.
This has occurred five times in US history, including in the
2000 and 2016
elections, where the winner of the popular vote lost the Electoral College.
How is the Indian Presidential Election Different from the US Presidential Election?
Electoral College Composition:
The President is elected through an
electoral college system
made up of:
Elected Members of Parliament (MPs)
: This includes all elected members from both Houses of Parliament, namely the
Lok Sabha
(House of the People) and the
Rajya Sabha
(Council of States).
Elected Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs)
: This includes elected members from the
of all States and Union Territories of
Delhi and Puducherry.
Nomination Process:
A candidate must file a nomination along with a signed list of
50 proposers
50 seconders
These proposers and seconders must be drawn from the electoral college members.
Voting Process:
In the presidential election Voters from the electoral college
do not vote for a party candidate
but instead write the names of candidates on the ballot paper in
order of preference
This system allows voters to
express their preferences
rather than a single choice.
Vote Value Calculation:
The voting system assigns different values to votes cast by MPs and MLAs:
Value of an MP's vote
: Each MP, whether from the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, has a
fixed vote value of 700
Value of an MLA's vote
: The value of each MLAs vote is determined by
dividing the population of the State by the number of MLAs
in its legislative Assembly, and the quotient achieved is
further divided by 1000
. E.g., Uttar Pradesh has the highest vote value for each MLA at 208 while
Arunachal Pradesh
has the lowest at
8.
Winning Quota:
The candidate needs to secure
50% of the total votes cast + 1
to win. This differs from general elections where a simple majority is sufficient.
How Indian and US Presidents are Similar in Functioning?
Head of State
: Both serve as the
ceremonial head
of state, representing the nation at official functions and diplomatic events.
Election Process
: Both are
to serve in their respective roles, though the methods of election differ
(indirect in India, direct in the US)
Veto Power
: Both have the authority to
veto legislation
passed by their respective legislative bodies.
Emergency Powers
: Both can declare a
state of
emergency
and assume special powers, although the nature and extent of these powers vary.
Diplomatic Role
: Both presidents have the power to
negotiate treaties
and represent their countries in
international relations
Ceremonial Duties
: Both perform various
ceremonial duties
, including the inauguration of new laws, the granting of honours, and the h
osting of foreign dignitaries

MPs and MLAs, showcasing unique approaches
to electing the nation's leader.
