CARBON MARKET
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – ENVIRONMENT
Context:
COP29, held at Azerbaijan’s capital Baku, has given a fillip to the idea of using carbon markets to curb carbon emissions by approving standards that can help in the setting up of an international carbon market as soon as the coming year.
Background: –
Carbon credits were first used in the 1990s in the U.S.
What is a carbon market?
A carbon market allows the buying and selling of the right to emit carbon. Suppose a government wants to limit the amount of carbon emitted. It can issue certificates called carbon credits that allow certificate holders to emit a certain amount of carbon. One carbon credit is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide. By limiting the number of carbon credits that are issued, governments can control how much carbon is released into the environment. It should be noted that anyone who doesn’t hold carbon credits would not be allowed to emit any carbon into the atmosphere.
Individuals and firms that hold carbon credits but don’t actually need them for any reason can sell their credits to interested buyers. The price is determined by market forces, which in this case are the supply of carbon credits and the demand for these certificates.
A carbon market can also include the trading of carbon offsets. In this case, a business that pollutes the environment for example, can purchase carbon offsets sold by a NGO that promises to plant trees that suck a certain amount of carbon emissions out of the atmosphere for each offset that it sells.
What is Good about Carbon Markets?
Addresses Externalities:
Carbon emissions are a negative externality where the cost of pollution is not accounted for in market prices.
Carbon markets impose a financial cost on polluters, incentivizing firms to reduce emissions.
Monetary Incentive to Reduce Pollution: Firms must purchase the right to pollute, encouraging them to minimize emissions to save costs.
Improved Carbon Accounting: Technological advancements and standardized accounting frameworks have enhanced the ability of corporations to monitor and report emissions.
Flexibility for Firms: Firms can purchase credits from others that don’t need them, optimizing resource allocation.
What Can Go Wrong with Carbon Markets?
Manipulation by Governments:
Governments disinterested in reducing emissions may flood the market with carbon credits, reducing their price and effectiveness.
Conversely, excessive restrictions on carbon credits may unnecessarily slow economic growth.
Cheating and Non-Compliance: Firms may find ways to cheat the system and emit carbon illegally without purchasing credits. Enforcement of compliance is critical for market success.
Ineffective Carbon Offsets: Firms may invest in carbon offsets as a form of virtue signaling without ensuring they truly reduce emissions.
Limited Incentives for Small Businesses: Small businesses, particularly in developing nations, face challenges in accurately monitoring emissions.
Varied Production Processes: Diverse supply chains and production methods make it difficult to establish uniform carbon budgets for all facilities.

GOLAN HEIGHTS
Prelims – GEOGRAPHY
Israel is set to double its population on the occupied Golan Heights while saying threats from Syria remained despite the moderate tone of rebel leaders who ousted President Bashar al-Assad a week ago.
Israel captured most of the strategic plateau from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War, annexing it in 1981.
Key takeaways
The Golan Heights is a strategically significant plateau located in southwestern
Syria, bordered by Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan.
The Golan Heights covers an area of approximately 1,800 km². It is characterized by its hilly terrain and basaltic rock formations.
The Golan Heights offers a vantage point overlooking the Jordan River valley and the Sea of Galilee.
It is bordered by the Yarmouk river in the south and the Sea of Galilee in the west.
The hilly land is fertile, and the volcanic soil grows apple and cherry orchards as well as vineyards. The region has vital water sources that feed the Jordan River, including the Hasbani River, which flows from Lebanon and through the Golan.
Population: The region has a population of around 55,000 people, including 24,000 Druze who identify as Syrians.
Highest Point: The highest elevation is Mount Hermon, which stands at 2,814 meters (9,232 feet).
Ottoman Rule: The Golan Heights came under Ottoman control in the 16th century and later became part of the French Mandate in Syria.

Modern History:
During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel captured the Golan HeDuring the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, Syria attempted to take back the Golan Heights but failed to do so.
In 1974, the UN got involved, deploying peacekeeping forces in the area after Israel and Syria signed an armistice.
The Security Council established the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) the same year as it tried to maintain a ceasefire and creating a ceasefire buffer zone in the area. As of April, 1,274 UN personnel are deployed in the Golan Heights.
In 1981, Israel formally declared its annexation of the Golan Heights.
In 2019, the US, under then-President Donald Trump, recognised Israeli sovreignty over the Golan Heights. The recognition still stands, even under President Joe Biden’s administration.

OLIVE RIDLEY TURTLES
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
Carcasses of Olive Ridley turtles, which are currently in their breeding season, continue to wash ashore along the Visakhapatnam coast.
Environmental experts say that a majority of the deaths are due to marine pollution and trawling activities for catching fish.
Key takeaways:
The Olive Ridley Turtle (scientific name: Lepidochelys olivacea) is the smallest and most abundant sea turtle species in the world.
Size: Olive Ridley turtles grow to about 2 feet in length and weigh around 50 kg.
Habitat: They inhabit warm and tropical waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian
Oceans.
Appearance: They get their name from their olive-colored carapace (shell), which is heart-shaped and rounded.
Carnivorous: Olive Ridley turtles are carnivores, feeding mainly on jellyfish, shrimp, snails, crabs, mollusks, and various fish and their eggs.
Unique Behavior:
Arribada: Olive Ridley turtles are best known for their unique mass nesting behavior called arribada, where thousands of females come together on the same beach to lay eggs.
Nesting Sites: The coast of Orissa in India is the largest mass nesting site for Olive Ridley turtles, followed by the coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica.
Major nesting sites in India include:
Odisha: Gahirmatha Beach, Rushikulya River mouth, and Devi River mouth.

MINERAL DIPLOMACY
Mains – GS 2
As India seeks to expand its manufacturing and technological capability, critical minerals will become vital to fulfil this ambition.
India is a major critical mineral importer, still depends on other countries, primarily China, for its mineral security, which has become a cause of strategic concern.
To address India’s mineral security challenge, New Delhi has started an attempt to engage in mineral diplomacy. This attempt is based on the pillars of: developing international engagement with mineral-producing countries, and establishing strategic partnerships with intergovernmental organisations.
The first pillar focuses on building bilateral ties with resource-rich countries such as Australia, Argentina, the United States, Russia, and Kazakhstan to secure the supply.
To facilitate, India established the Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. (KABIL), a joint venture company with a mandate to ensure a consistent supply of critical and strategic minerals to the Indian domestic market.
In March 2022, KABIL signed a Memorandum of understanding with Australia for a critical mineral investment partnership, identifying two lithium and three cobalt projects.
Latin America’s Lithium Triangle, which constitutes Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia, has attracted India. India signed a $24 million lithium exploration pact with a state-owned enterprise in Argentina for five lithium brine blocks. KABIL is actively working to secure mineral supplies by facilitating the buying of assets from Bolivia and Chile.
Central Asia has also caught India’s attention. India and Kazakhstan formed a joint venture, IREUK Titanium Limited, to produce titanium slag in India.
The second pillar of mineral diplomacy is forging and strengthening partnerships with minilateral and multilateral initiatives related to mineral security, such as the Quad, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) and the G-7, for cooperation in supply chain.
The missing pieces
India’s mineral diplomacy still lacks three essential ingredients. These are: a lack of private sector participation; weak diplomatic capacity, and insufficient sustainable partnership.
India’s private sector has largely been missing from the equation. The absence of a critical mineral supply chain strategy and a clear road map for the private sector are two primary variables responsible for their absenteeism.
Second, India must strengthen its mineral diplomacy engagement. Having a dedicated mineral diplomacy division within the Ministry of External Affairs, similar to the New and Emerging Strategic Technologies (NEST) division and a special position for mineral diplomacy in selected diplomatic missions can be a step.
Third, Delhi must forge strategic, sustainable, and trusted partnerships with bilateral partners and multilateral forums. Among all its partners, working with EU, South Korea, and the other Quad members is critical to India’s mineral security due to its domestic capabilities, diplomatic network and technological know-how.

**********India’s Firmer Attempts at Mineral Diplomacy
Context
As India charts a path toward becoming a manufacturing and technological powerhouse
, the need for critical minerals is paramount.
These minerals form the backbone of advanced industries such as electronics, renewable energy, and defence manufacturing,
however, India's dependency on imports, especially from China, poses strategic vulnerabilities.
Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s remarks about the weaponisation of resources highlight growing concerns about mineral security
, driving India to pursue mineral diplomacy as a cornerstone of its strategy to mitigate this dependence.
A Closer Look of the Pillars of India's Mineral Diplomacy
Developing Joint Ventures with Resource-Rich Nations: Building Bilateral Ties
These joint ventures are
designed to reduce India’s reliance on a single source,
particularly Chin, and ensure consistent access to these indispensable resources.
A 2022 agreement between India and Australia marked a significant milestone,
identifying lithium and cobalt projects for collaboration.
This
partnership leverages Australia’s robust mining sector to meet India’s growing demand
for these minerals.
The South American Region, comprising Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia, is a global hub for lithium resources.
India’s $24 million lithium exploration pact with Argentina in 2024 demonstrates its commitment to securing raw materials
for lithium-ion battery production. Similarly, efforts are underway to acquire assets in Bolivia and Chile.
Role of KABIL
creation of Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. (KABIL) exemplifies India’s strategic approach
to mineral diplomacy.
KABIL functions as a joint venture tasked with identifying and acquiring critical mineral
assets worldwide.
By facilitating agreements through various routes
, government-to-government, government-to-business, and business-to-business,
KABIL plays a pivotal role in securing India’s mineral future.
Private Sector Participation
India’s private sector has also begun to capitalise on these international collaborations.
For instance,
Altmin Private Limited partnered with Bolivia’s state-owned company YLB to ensure the supply of raw materials
for lithium-ion batteries.
Such initiatives not only strengthen India’s supply chain but also boost private sector
involvement in global mineral trade.
Central Asia and Titanium Resources
Central Asia has emerged as another focal point of India’s mineral diplomacy.
The establishment of IREUK Titanium Limited in Kazakhstan is a landmark achievement,
reflecting India’s intent to tap into the region’s rich titanium reserves.
venture aligns with New Delhi’s proposal to create an India-Central Asia Rare Earths Forum,
which aims to deepen collaboration in exploring and utilizing the region’s mineral wealth.
Challenges in India’s Mineral Diplomacy
Limited Private Sector Involvement
India’s private sector has played a minimal role in the critical minerals supply chain.
This is largely due to the absence of a clear roadmap
and policy framework for private sector participation.
Without an overarching supply chain strategy, businesses lack direction
and incentive to invest in critical mineral initiatives.
Weak Diplomatic Capacity
India’s diplomatic apparatus currently lacks the dedicated resources
to address the nuances of mineral diplomacy.
Establishing a dedicated mineral diplomacy division within the Ministry of External Affairs, akin to the New and Emerging Strategic Technologies (NEST) division, could enhance India’s engagement
with international partners.
Insufficient Sustainable Partnerships
While India has formed agreements with several countries,
many of these partnerships lack long-term sustainability.
Building trusted and strategic alliances
, particularly with technologically advanced nations like South Korea, the European Union, and other Quad members,
is crucial for advancing India’s mineral security.
The Path Forward to Strengthening India’s Mineral Diplomacy
Diversifying the Supply Chain
India’s dependence on a few nations
poses significant risks to its mineral security.
Geopolitical volatility, regulatory changes
, or economic disruptions in supplier nations
could impact India’s access to essential resources.
India must seek new partnerships with emerging resource-rich nations,
particularly in Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia.
Countries like Namibia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Indonesia hold substantial reserves of critical minerals like lithium
, cobalt, and nickel, offering opportunities for diversification.
India can replicate successful models like its agreements with Australia and Argentina
by negotiating government-to-government pacts with these nations.
Reducing Reliance on China and Forming Regional Alliances
While China dominates the global supply chain for many critical minerals,
India must develop alternative sourcing channels to reduce its strategic dependence.
Strengthening ties with democratic and like-minded nations
such as Japan, South Korea, and the United States
can help diversify supply routes.
India’s proposed India-Central Asia Rare Earths Forum could serve as a template
for creating regional alliances.
Building Diplomatic and Institutional Capacity
Dedicated Mineral Diplomacy Division
Creating a specialised division within the Ministry of External Affairs
to focus exclusively on mineral diplomacy will enhance policy coherence and execution.
division should monitor global mineral trends, facilitate bilateral and multilateral engagements
, and ensure alignment with national priorities.
Deploying Experts in Key Missions
Resource-rich nations and regions like Latin America, Africa, and Central Asia require India’s diplomatic missions
to include mineral experts.
specialists can proactively identify opportunities, mitigate challenges, and strengthen India’s presence
in critical mineral markets.
Institutional Coordination
Enhanced collaboration between ministries
(e.g., Mines, External Affairs, and Industry) and organizations like KABIL and NITI Aayog
will ensure a unified approach to mineral security.
Establishing an inter-ministerial task force
to align strategies and coordinate
actions will be beneficial.
Strengthening Private Sector Involvement
Developing a Supply Chain Strategy
India needs a national strategy for critical minerals
that clearly outlines the role of the private sector.
This strategy should include guidelines for exploration, mining, processing, and recycling,
along with financial incentives to encourage private investment.
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
Promoting PPP models will enable private enterprises to leverage government support for risk management
, infrastructure development, and capacity-building.
Collaborations between government entities
like KABIL and private firms
can create a seamless value chain.
Supporting Startups and Innovation
Encouraging startups to explore cutting-edge technologies
for mineral extraction and processing
will strengthen India’s domestic capabilities.
Providing funding, incubation
, and mentorship to such ventures
can accelerate innovation in this sector.
Conclusion
India’s journey toward mineral security is both ambitious and necessary
to support its aspirations as a global manufacturing and technological leader.
While initiatives like KABIL and international collaborations represent significant strides,
addressing existing gaps in private sector engagement, diplomatic capacity, and sustainable partnerships will be crucial.
By resolving these issues, India can reduce its strategic vulnerabilities and establish itself as a key player
in the global critical mineral supply chain.

Editorial Analysis
**********What is Henderson Doctrine?
In a recent case, the Supreme Court explained Henderson doctrine, a natural corollary of the Indian doctrine of constructive Res-judicata.
About Henderson Doctrine:
Propounded in the English case of Henderson versus Henderson, 1843, the doctrine suggests that
all the issues arising in the litigation out of the same subject matter must be addressed in a single suit.
The doctrine
bars relitigating issues
that could
or should
have been raised in prior proceedings.
It held that
where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation
and the adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction, the
parties so litigating are required to bring forward their whole case.
It was further held that the
principle of res judicata applies not only to points upon which
the Court was called upon
by the parties to adjudicate
and pronounce a judgement
but to every possible
or probable point or
issue that properly belonged to the subject
of litigation and
the parties ought to have brought forward at the time
ensures
litigants are not subjected to repetitive
and vexatious
legal challenges.
At its core, the principle stipulates that
all claims and issues
and should have
been raised in an earlier proceeding are barred from
being raised in subsequent
, except in exceptional circumstances.
What is the Principle of res judicata?
Res judicata literally means ‘
the thing has been judged”.
It is also
known as claim preclusion.
The principle of res judicata
when a litigant attempts to file a subsequent lawsuit
on the same matter
after having received a judgment
in a previous case
involving the same parties.
It is a judicial concept, which means that the
issue before the court has already been decided by another court
between the same parties
, and the
courts do not allow a petition to be filed
in the same court or in another court.
Therefore, the
court will dismiss the case
before it as being useless.
Res Judicata as a concept is applicable
both in Civil as well as Criminal legal system.

**********Khiamniungan Tribe
The Nagaland Tourism Department recently issued a formal apology to the Khiamniungan Union Kohima following the omission of the Khiamniungan Tribe’s name in the Heritage Guide Map displayed during the Hornbill Festival 2024.
About Khiamniungan Tribe:
The Khiamniungan tribe is one of the
major tribes among the Nagas,
with habitation both in
India and Myanmar.
Geographically, the land of Khiamniungans is located in the
Eastern part of Nagaland
and in the
North-Western part of Myanmar
The nomenclature of the tribe ‘Khiamniungan’ is a compound word formed by three words: ‘Khiam’ means water, ‘Niu’ means great and ‘Ngan’ means source. Thus, the meaning of the term Khiamniungan is ‘source of great water or river’.
According to the 2011 census, the total population of the Khiamniungan tribe in India is 61,983.
Major Festivals:
Tsokum
is one of the most important and significant festivals which is celebrated with great pomp and gaity.

**********Understanding Carbon Markets and Their Role in Combating Climate Change
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Carbon Market (Meaning, Mechanism, Benefits, Criticism, Industry/Govt. Perspectives etc.)
What is a Carbon Market?
carbon market
is a system that allows the buying and selling of the right to emit carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere.
Governments issue
carbon credits
, where
one credit equals 1,000 kilograms of CO2 emissions
The idea is to control the total carbon released by limiting the number of carbon credits issued.
Firms or individuals exceeding their emission quotas must buy additional credits from those who emit less than their allowance. This trading creates a financial incentive to reduce emissions.
The concept first emerged in the 1990s in the U.S., using a
cap-and-trade model
to regulate sulphur dioxide emissions.
Now, carbon markets are expanding to include
carbon offsets
, where businesses pay for environmental projects like tree planting to compensate for their emissions.
Benefits of Carbon Markets:
Internalizing Externalities
: Emissions are a classic
externality
, where businesses do not bear the cost of the pollution they cause. Carbon markets impose a price on emissions, motivating companies to reduce their carbon footprint.
Market Efficiency
: Allowing the trading of credits ensures that firms with lower costs of reducing emissions take more action, optimizing resource allocation.
Improved Monitoring
: Technological advancements have enhanced the tracking and reporting of emissions, making the system more reliable.
Criticism and Challenges:
Manipulation of Supply
: Governments might issue excessive credits, reducing their price and failing to curb emissions effectively.
Lack of Incentives
: Firms may engage in
virtue signalling
by purchasing offsets without ensuring real emission reductions.
Voluntary Systems
: Large corporations often resist government-imposed budgets, preferring voluntary frameworks like the
Carbon Disclosure Project
Economic Impacts
: Critics argue that restricting carbon credits might slow economic growth.
How Carbon Markets Work?
Cap-and-Trade
: Governments set a cap on total emissions and issue credits accordingly. Companies that emit less can sell their unused credits to others.
Carbon Offsets
: Businesses pay for environmental initiatives, such as afforestation, to offset their emissions.
Price Determination
: Market forces of supply and demand decide the price of carbon credits.
Global Perspective and the Role of COP29:
The ongoing
COP29 Climate Conference in Baku
has approved standards to establish an international carbon market, potentially operational next year.
COP stands for
Conference of the Parties
and it often refers to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) international meeting focusing on climate.
This move aims to harmonize global efforts to curb emissions and align with the
Paris Agreement
Criticisms of Carbon Offsets:
Efficacy Concerns
: Some argue offsets are more about public image than actual impact.
Lack of Verification
: Ensuring that projects genuinely offset emissions remains a challenge.
Industry and Government Perspectives:
Large corporations like ExxonMobil support market-based mechanisms over government controls, arguing for flexibility and cost-efficiency.
Governments must balance environmental objectives with economic growth, navigating complexities in regulating and monitoring emissions.
Conclusion:
Carbon markets offer a promising tool for mitigating climate change by assigning economic value to carbon emissions.
However, their success depends on robust regulation, transparency, and genuine commitment from all stakeholders.
By addressing the criticisms and refining the system, carbon markets can significantly contribute to achieving global climate goals.

**********Santa Ana Wind
Recently, experts suggest that Santa Ana winds and climate change are fueling wildfires in Malibu coastal town of Malibu, California.
About
Santa Ana Wind:
It is named after Southern California's
Santa Ana Canyon
Santa Ana winds are
dry and warm
(often hot)
in the Southern California area that blow in from the desert -- which includes the Great Basin of the western United States.
Origin:
Santa Ana winds blow when
high pressure builds over the Great Basin
— the area between the
Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada
(a mountain range in the Western United States) — and the pressure is low over California’s coast.
The difference in pressure triggers the movement of powerful winds from the Basin’s inland deserts, east and north of Southern California, over the mountains toward the Pacific Ocean.
As the wind comes down the mountains, it compresses and heats up. The wind’s humidity also drops, sometimes to less than
20% or even less than 10%.
The extremely low moisture turns vegetation dry, making it ready to burn.
Winter weather patterns allow high pressure to build near the surface of the Great Basin, which then interacts with low-pressure air over the Pacific.
Santa Ana winds usually occur from
October to January

**********Search and Rescue Aid Tool (SARAT)
Recently, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has developed a newer version of its own Search and Rescue Aid Tool (SARAT).
About
Search and Rescue Aid Tool:
It was
launched in 2016
facilitating search and rescue operations
in the seas to locate individuals/vessels in distress in the shortest possible time.
This has been initiated and developed under the Make in India program
and developed by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services
(INCOIS).
Working
The tool uses model ensembling that accounts for uncertainties in the initial location as well as the last known time of the missing object, to locate the person or object with high probability.
The movements of the missing objects are governed
mainly by the currents and winds.
The tool is based on model currents derived from a very
high-resolution Regional Ocean Modelling System
run operationally on High-Performance Computers at INCOIS.
The user has the option to select up to
60 types of missing objects
(based on shape and buoyancy).
Users can select a specific point where the object was last seen using the interactive map or they can also select a coastal location, distance travelled and bearing angle so that the last known location of the missing object is estimated.
The results
generated are displayed in an interactive map
depicting the probable area to be searched and are also sent as text messages to emails/mobile phones.
All the requests and responses are
provided in the languages of the coastal states
so that local fishermen can use them immediately to search for their fellow fishermen in distress.
SARAT version 2,
the position from which the search area expands has now been corrected to be the last known position of the object.
It further
offers improved visualizations
for a better judgement of a probable area of finding the missing object,
colour coding of search regions
, and a marker for easier identification of the last known position of the object.

**********Sanganer open air jail
Why in news?
A Supreme Court-appointed commissioner will visit the
Sanganer open prison
, one of India’s largest.
The visit follows a dispute over the Rajasthan government’s plan to construct a hospital on land currently used by the jail. The Supreme Court, during a hearing on November 25, directed the commissioner to inspect the site and submit a report within four weeks.
What’s in today’s article?
Open Prison
History of Open Jails in India
Sanganer Open Jail: A Model for Open-Air Camps
Dispute Over Land Allocation at Sanganer Open Jail
Definition
Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023
, defines open correctional institutions as facilities offering eligible prisoners more freedom outside regular prisons to aid their rehabilitation.
Since prisons are a state subject
, state governments set their own rules for establishing open jails, with eligibility typically based on the nature of the crime, inmate behavior, and sentence completion.
Features
Open jails have minimal security, allowing convicts to engage in activities like agriculture.
These facilities help reduce overcrowding in regular prisons and
facilitate prisoner reintegration into society
Some states designate separate areas within closed jails for open jail inmates, while others establish independent colonies where prisoners may live with their spouses under restricted movement.
Background
first open jail in independent India was established in 1949 in Lucknow
, Uttar Pradesh, followed by similar jails in other parts of the state in 1952.
The concept of
open-air camps was proposed at the Hague Conference
in 1952 to help prisoners lead a near-community life after completing part of their sentence.
Justice Mulla Committee on Open Jails (1980-83)
All-India Committee on Jail Reform
, also known as the Justice Mulla Committee, reported 28-30 open jails in India during 1980-83.
It highlighted the lack of a legal framework in many states and noted that only 13 states had rules for open jails.
The committee recommended:
Using land near closed prisons for open jails.
Engaging inmates in work-based activities like agriculture, dairy farming, and projects such as dam construction.
Providing uniform wages, as some states offered only token wages while others paid at community-level rates.
Current Status of Open Jails in India
As per the
Prison Statistics of India 2022
, there are
91 open jails across 17 states
, with a capacity of 6,043 inmates and 4,473 prisoners currently lodged.
Rajasthan has the highest number of open jails
(41), followed by Maharashtra (19). Open jails remain a significant initiative to reduce overcrowding and rehabilitate prisoners.
Historical Background
The Sanganer open jail, also known as Sampurnanand Khula Bandi Shivir, was established in 1963.
It has operated continuously, unlike other open jails that faced closures due to issues like prison breaks.
Unique Features
Accommodation for Families
: Inmates can live with their spouses and children, fostering a family-like environment.
Self-Sufficiency
: Inmates pay for water and electricity, construct and maintain their own homes, and earn a living through local community jobs such as running shops.
Self-Governance
: The jail has bandi panchayats, where prisoners manage roll calls twice daily and oversee internal governance.
Infrastructure and Community Integration
Facilities:
The complex includes a primary school (open to local children), anganwadis, and a playground.
Work Opportunities
: Inmates work within the local community, ensuring financial independence.
Access to Technology
: Inmates have access to phones, promoting better communication.
Inmate Selection Criteria
Unlike most open jails, where prisoners nearing the end of their sentence are admitted.
Sanganer requires prisoners to have completed at least 6 years and 8 months of their term, along with good conduct.
Legacy and Influence
The Mulla Committee recommended replicating Sanganer as the “final stage in the open camp movement.”
Inspired by its success, many additional open-air camps have been established in Rajasthan, making it the state with the highest number of such facilities in India.
Background: Supreme Court’s Previous Directive
In May 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that areas of open jails should not be reduced, emphasizing the importance of preserving such spaces.
Contempt Petition filed
Filed by a social worker, the petition argues that the Rajasthan government’s plan to allocate 21,948 square meters of jail land for a hospital will disrupt the ecosystem of this unique and successful open jail model.
State Government’s Position
The government denies any attempt to reduce the jail’s area.
It claims that some structures for prisoners were constructed unauthorizedly and proposes to allot additional land to relocate prisoners to new shelters.
Supreme Court’s Stance on this issue
On November 25, the SC bench emphasized balancing the needs of the open correctional home and the hospital, which would serve the surrounding community.
The court also appointed a court commissioner who will inspect the site and submit a report.

**********Implementation of POSH Act to political parties
Why in news?
The Supreme Court recently heard a PIL advocating for the application of The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (commonly known as the
POSH Act, 2013
) to political parties.
The petitioner highlighted inconsistencies in the presence of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) within political parties to address sexual harassment complaints.
The court directed the petitioner to approach the Election Commission of India (ECI), deeming it the appropriate authority to encourage political parties to establish mechanisms compliant with the POSH Act.
This case has raised questions about the applicability of the POSH Act to organisations like political parties, which often do not conform to conventional workplace structures.
What’s in today’s article?
POSH Act 2013
Applicability of the POSH Act to Political Parties: Legal Challenges
Political Parties and POSH Act
ECI’s stand on getting political parties to comply with other laws
The PoSH Act 2013:
Background - Vishakha v. The State of Rajasthan (1997):
The SC issued the
Vishaka Guidelines
, with the primary objective of providing a mechanism for workplace sexual misconduct redress and grievance processes.
These recommendations inspired the PoSH Act - a law administered by the Union
Ministry of Women & Child Development (MoWCD).
Objective of the PoSH Act:
It aims to protect the
rights of women
at work and to
make the workplace a safer place
for them.
The legislation also functions as a forum for
both avoiding and addressing problems.
Section 3(1) of the POSH Act
Section 3(1) of the POSH Act ensures protection against sexual harassment for women at workplaces.
The Act broadly defines "workplace" to include both public and private organisations, hospitals, sports venues, homes, and locations visited during employment.
However,
its application to political parties is unclear due to their unique structure
Issue raised by the Kerala HC
The Kerala High Court addressed this in
Centre for Constitutional Rights Research and Advocacy v. State of Kerala & Ors (2022)
The court ruled that political parties lack an employer-employee relationship with their members and do not fit the definition of a "workplace" under the POSH Act.
Consequently, political parties were deemed not liable to establish Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs).
This raises legal and structural challenges in ensuring accountability for sexual harassment within political organisations.
Registration of Political Parties Under the Representation of People Act, 1951
Section 29A of the Representation of People Act mandates political parties to register with the Election Commission of India (ECI).
The registration application requires details such as the party’s name, headquarters, office bearers, local units, and members.
It must also include a memorandum affirming allegiance to the Constitution of India.
Challenges in Applying the POSH Act to Political Parties
The POSH Act aims to protect women from sexual harassment at workplaces, but its applicability to political parties is unclear
due to their non-traditional structures
Party workers, often temporary or field-based, may lack a defined “workplace” and have limited interaction with higher-level officials.
Identifying the “employer” within a political party, as required by the POSH Act for forming an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), is also ambiguous
Expansive Definitions in the POSH Act
Despite challenges, the POSH Act’s broad definitions of “workplace” and “employee” could provide some basis for application.
The Act includes locations visited during employment and recognizes temporary, contractual, or volunteer workers as employees, potentially covering party workers.
Party constitutions that outline organisational hierarchies could also help identify the “employer” responsible for setting up ICCs.
Current Internal Discipline Mechanisms in Political Parties
Political parties handle discipline through internal committees, such as the Congress’ hierarchical committees and the BJP’s “Disciplinary Action Committees.”
While these bodies address broad breaches of discipline like “moral turpitude” or actions lowering the party’s prestige, they lack specific provisions for handling sexual harassment.
They also do not require women or external members, as mandated for ICCs under the POSH Act.
ECI’s stand been on getting political parties to comply with other laws
ECI’s Authority and Role in Elections
Under Article 324 of the Constitution, the Election Commission of India (ECI) is empowered with the superintendence, direction, and control of elections to Parliament, State legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President.
Its authority is reinforced by the Representation of People Act, 1951 (RP Act).
Ambiguity in Enforcing Compliance with Other Laws
The ECI’s role is well-defined under the RP Act, but its authority to enforce compliance with other laws, such as the Right to Information Act, 2005, remains unclear.
Despite a
2013 ruling by the Central Information Commission (CIC) declaring political parties as public authorities under the RTI Act
, parties have yet to comply by appointing public information officers, as mandated.
ECI’s Adherence to the CIC Order
The ECI has aligned itself with the CIC’s 2013 order, maintaining that national parties are public authorities under the RTI Act.
In a 2018 press statement, the ECI affirmed that it publishes all information submitted by parties, including contributions and annual audited accounts, in the public domain.
Issuing Advisories to Enforce Other Laws
The ECI adopts an advisory approach to encourage compliance with laws beyond the RP Act.
For example, ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, it instructed parties not to involve children in campaigning, in adherence to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986.
This reflects the ECI’s broader efforts to promote legal compliance among political parties.

**********Could the POSH Act apply to political parties?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Recently, the SC considered a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) advocating for the applicability of the
Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013
to political parties.
What is the legal status of political parties concerning the POSH Act?
Current Legal Interpretation:
The Kerala HC previously ruled that political parties do not fall under the scope of the POSH Act due to a lack of an employer-employee relationship with their members. This interpretation suggests that political parties are not obligated to establish ICCs as required by the Act.
Definition of Workplace:
The POSH Act defines “workplace” broadly, including various public and private entities. However, applying this definition to political parties is complex, as many party workers operate without a defined workplace and often have temporary roles that do not align with traditional employment structures.
Potential for Inclusion:
Advocates argue that since the POSH Act includes locations visited by employees during their course of employment, it could extend protections to party workers in field operations. The definition of “employee” also encompasses temporary and contract workers, which could potentially include political party members.
How can Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) be effectively established?
What are Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs)?
are mandated bodies established under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 in India. These committees play a crucial role in addressing complaints of sexual harassment in the workplace, ensuring a safe and supportive environment for all employees.
Need for ICCs:
The recent PIL presented in the court emphasizes that political parties should have mechanisms to address sexual harassment complaints in line with the POSH Act.
Currently, internal discipline mechanisms within parties may not adequately address issues of sexual harassment or comply with ICC requirements under the Act.
Challenges in Implementation:
Creating ICCs within political parties poses challenges due to their non-traditional structures. The determination of who qualifies as an “employer” in this context is crucial for establishing accountability and compliance with the POSH Act.
Existing Party Structures:
Political party constitutions outline hierarchical structures that could potentially facilitate the establishment of ICCs. However, these existing frameworks may not meet the requirements set forth by the POSH Act regarding membership and external oversight.
What role should the ECI play in enforcing compliance with the POSH Act?
Competent Authority:
The Supreme Court directed that any grievances regarding the application of the POSH Act to political parties should first be addressed to the ECI, which is seen as the competent authority for enforcing compliance among registered political entities.
Historical Context:
The ECI has previously been involved in ensuring compliance with other laws applicable to political parties, such as the Right to Information Act. However, its role concerning workplace harassment laws remains less defined.
Future Implications:
If political parties are compelled to comply with the POSH Act through ECI directives, it could set a precedent for accountability and gender equality in politics, potentially influencing broader societal norms regarding workplace harassment.
Way forward:
Strengthening Compliance Framework:
The Election Commission of India (ECI) should issue clear guidelines requiring political parties to establish Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in alignment with the POSH Act, ensuring accountability and gender-sensitive grievance redressal mechanisms.
Legislative Clarification:
Amend the POSH Act to explicitly include political parties within its scope, defining “employer” and “workplace” in the context of party structures to address the unique challenges of non-traditional workplaces.

Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Prime Minister
renewed his call for a nationwide Uniform Civil Code (UCC)
, citing the views of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and KM Munshi from the Constituent Assembly discussions.
What is Uniform Civil Code (UCC)?
UCC is
envisioned under Article 44
of the Constitution, which calls for securing a UCC for all citizens throughout India.
Personal law subjects, including marriage, divorce, and inheritance,
fall under the Concurrent List.
Hindu personal laws:
Also applicable to Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists
as well, were
codified by Parliament in 1956
, encompassing: The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956.
Muslim personal matters
are governed by the
Shariat law of 1937.
state refrains from interfering
, and religious authorities decide based on Quran and Hadith.
UCC measures in India:
Special Marriage Act, 1954:
Permits civil marriage for any citizen, regardless of religion, allowing marriage outside religious customs.
Shah Bano Case 1985:
Supreme Court ruled in favour of Shah Bano for maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC, advocating for a UCC.
Sarla Mudgal Judgement 1995 and Paulo Coutinho vs Maria Luiza Valentina Pereira case 2019:
Supreme Court reiterated the need for implementing the UCC, urging the government to enact it.
What KM Munshi Said on UCC
Support for UCC:
During the Constituent Assembly debate on
November 23, 1948
advocated for
the UCC. He rejected the argument that it would be tyrannical towards minorities.
Counterarguments
: Munshi pointed out that advan
ced Muslim countries did not regard personal law as untouchable
and had implemented civil codes.
Equality for Women
: He emphasized that
without a UCC, women’s rights in personal matters (like inheritance and succession) would remain unequal
, particularly in Hindu law, which discriminated against women.
National Unity
linked UCC with national unity
, stating that religion should be restricted to spiritual spheres and that social and civil matters should be regulated uniformly for the progress of the nation.
What Ambedkar Said on UCC
: Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, in the debate, did not delve into the merits or demerits of a UCC but
strongly supported Article 35
(which was later renumbered as A
rticle 44 of the Constitution of India
), which called for securing a uniform civil code for citizens.
Challenging Religious Personal Laws
criticized
the view that
Muslim personal law was immutable
and noted that regions like the
North-West Frontier Province (pre-independence)
followed Hindu law
for issues like succession.
State Power and Personal Law
: He argued that
religion should not govern personal laws
and that the
State had the right to legislate and reform social systems
to address inequities and discriminations in personal laws.
What happened at the end of the Debate?
Passage of Article 35
: After discussions, Article 35 was passed by the Constituent Assembly. This article laid down the directive principle that the State shall endeavor to secure a UCC for the citizens of India.
Renumbering to Article 44
: Later, this article was renumbered as Article 44 in the Indian Constitution. It continues to remain a Directive Principle of State Policy (DPSP), guiding future policies on personal laws and advocating for uniformity in civil matters across religious communities.

**********First Ice-Free day in the Arctic could come by 2030: Study
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
De-glaciation of Arctic
Why in the News?
A recent study suggests that the
Arctic Ocean
may experience its
first
ice-free day
—where sea ice falls below one million square kilometres—by
, or even sooner.
Key Highlights of the Study
First Ice-Free Day Prediction
: The study predicts that the
could experience its first
(less than one million square kilometres of sea ice) by
, or even sooner, depending on climatic conditions.
Simulations and Models
11 different
climate models
were used to run
366 simulations
from
2023 to 2100
to assess the future of Arctic sea ice.
Most simulations predict the
within
7 to 20 years
, with some models suggesting it could happen as early as
September 2027
Conditions for Ice-Free Day
: The occurrence of an ice-free day will depend on a combination of unusually
warm seasons
stormy weather
, which accelerates the melting of the sea ice.
Impact on Sea Ice
: Once the first ice-free day occurs, it could be followed by an
ice-free period
lasting between
11 to 53 days
, potentially leading to the first
ice-free month
Why does it matter?
Climate Change Acceleration
: The loss of sea ice will amplify the
Albedo effect
, causing the Arctic region to absorb more sunlight and heat, which will
accelerate global warming
and trigger extreme weather events in mid-latitudes.
Rising Sea Levels
: The loss of Arctic ice contributes to
sea level rise
, with potential long-term impacts on coastal populations and ecosystems, particularly if the
Greenland ice sheet
melts completely, which could raise sea levels by
6 meters
Ecosystem and Species Impact
: The melting of sea ice will threaten species that rely on the ice for habitat, such as
polar bears
walruses
, and
reindeer
, disrupting the Arctic food chain.
Human and Infrastructure Threats
: Arctic communities and their
infrastructure
are at risk as the region warms at
four times the global average
, threatening the livelihoods of people living in these areas.
Back2Basics: Albedo Effect
It refers to the measure of
how much sunlight is reflected
by a surface.
It is expressed as a
percentage
; a surface with a
high albedo reflects more sunlight
, while a surface with a low albedo absorbs more.
Light-colored surfaces like ice and snow have high albedo, reflecting most of the sunlight, whereas dark surfaces like oceans and forests have low albedo, absorbing more heat.

Discuss global warming and mention its effects on the global climate. Explain the control measures to bring down the level of greenhouse gases which cause global warming, in the light of the Kyoto Protocol, 1997.
[2012]
The increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the air is slowly raising the temperature of the atmosphere because it absorbs:
(a) the water vapour of the air and retains its heat
(b) the ultraviolet part of the solar radiation
(c) all the solar radiations
(d) the infrared part of the solar radiation
