CAN INDIA ESCAPE MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP?
Syllabus
Mains – ECONOMY
Context:
The World Development Report 2024 — authored by the World Bank — calls attention to the phenomenon of the “middle-income” trap, or the slowing down of growth rates as incomes increase.
Background: –
Over the last 34 years, only 34 middle-income economies — defined as economies with per capita incomes between $1,136 and $13,845 — have transitioned to higher income levels.
Key takeaways
The WDR details the policies and strategies necessary to break the trap based on the experiences of countries that did manage the transition. It highlights the importance of the “3i” approach: investment, infusion, and innovation.
Economies must invest, ensure the infusion of new global technologies, and develop an environment conducive to domestic innovation.
Role of the state
Most countries that broke the trap were part of the European Union which facilitated growth and mobility of capital and labour for its members. Such institutions that aid free factor mobility are not available for most countries.
An important non-European country that managed to escape the trap is South Korea.
The South Korean state was heavily interventionist, often directing the private sector’s activities and ensuring their participation in an export-driven growth model. Successful companies were rewarded with access to new technologies and supportive measures, while firms that did not perform were allowed to fail.
Another economy that broke the trap was Chile. But it too, saw state intervention in ensuring the success of natural resource exporting sectors. The salmon industry, for instance, succeeded in Chile due to the targeted intervention of the state to ensure that the industry flourished.
The South Korean government’s approach carries significant lessons. The state must be seen as being neutral amongst private players and ensuring those who do not make the mark are allowed to fail. The benefits firms receive from the state must be based on performance instead of closeness to power. The presence of powerful business houses can promote growth provided they invest, ensure the adoption and infusion of new technologies, and innovate.
The pitfalls
South Korea’s success was built on manufacturing exports; such a strategy is not possible now. World export growth has slowed, with demand slowing down. Several countries have turned to protectionism due to perceived job loss.
Several countries have been hit by ‘premature deindustrialisation’. Modern economies face a reduction in the income share of manufacturing at much lower levels of GDP compared to previous economies.
Manufacturing is no longer an engine of growth for developing economies, and it remains to be seen whether the service sector is strong enough to break the trap.
Challenges facing India
The power of billionaires in the Indian economy has increased, and they are seen as being close to the state, with the state unable — or unwilling — to ensure high rates of investment from domestic capital.
The manufacturing sector has stagnated, and there has been a reversal of the process of structural transformation, with employment increasing in agriculture and in low-productive forms following the pandemic.
While the government estimates a real GDP growth of around 7% in recent years, wages have not kept up. Wage earners have seen little to no real wage growth. An economy cannot break a middle-income trap if workers are unable to partake in the growth process, as reduced consumption demand will become a drag.
South Korea’s export strategy was overseen by a military government that ruled till the 1980s. Chile deposed the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende by a coup. It is vital not to take the wrong lessons and think that democracy is an acceptable price to pay for higher growth. The challenge for policy is to promote state intervention to ensure growth while maintaining the sanctity of the democratic ethos.

ETHICAL LESSONS FROM THE LIFE OF RATAN TATA
Mains – GS 4
: Former Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata, whose dedication to integrity and social upliftment touched the hearts of many, breathed his last on Wednesday
Known for his ethical business practices and commitment to improving lives through social initiatives, Ratan Tata’s life serves as an example of how to bring change.
Key values, quotes and examples from his life
Kindness
: Kindness is a virtue that encompasses the ability to be polite and caring towards others. It entails empathy and compassion towards others.
During the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Ratan Tata displayed extraordinary kindness by providing free trucks to Sikh survivors who had lost their vehicles and livelihoods in the violence. Tata Motors’ gesture helped these individuals rebuild their businesses and regain their livelihood at a time of immense hardship.
Virtues such as kindness, empathy, and compassion play key roles in creating a positive environment, fostering a sense of safety, and building trust with others. Civil servants interact with diverse communities daily. By demonstrating empathy and kindness, they can build trust within the community.
Spirit of Service:
It is a quality of a person that encourages one to be committed to public service without any self motives.
During the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, Ratan Tata, as Chairman of the Tata Group, led the restoration of the Taj Hotel and personally supported affected employees. He quickly established the Taj Public Service Welfare Trust to provide relief to victims and to help and rehabilitate those recovering from such tragic events in the future, demonstrating compassion and resilience in a time of crisis.
Compassion
: Compassion is defined as the emotional response when perceiving suffering and involves an authentic desire to help. Practicing compassion increases our well-being by enhancing a sense of connection to others.
Ratan Tata is known for his love of animals, particularly dogs. A LinkedIn user shared a story of visiting Mumbai’s Taj Hotel, where she saw a dog being cared for by the staff. This act of compassion was due to Tata’s directive to treat animals kindly.
Leadership
: Leadership is the ability of an individual to guide and influence people. The values, decision-making style, ethics and interpersonal skills of leader profoundly influence the organization’s culture and public perception.
Ratan Tata chose to work as an employee for his own company. He joined Tata in 1961 and worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He wanted to get hand-on-experience at the grass root level to understand the nuances and problem.
“I don’t believe in work-life balance. I believe in work-life integration. Make your work and life meaningful and fulfilling, and they will complement each other.” This quote by Ratan Tata conveys that there is a need to adopt harmony in your job and personal life. Personal goals in the job and value systems in life should complement each other to give you satisfaction.
Perseverance
: Perseverance is continued persistence in doing what one considers to be right despite difficulties or delays in achieving the desired results. It implies unwavering steadfastness in pursuing the right course of action, even in the face of odds or failures.
The Tata Nano faced multiple challenges before its launch. Initially set to be manufactured in Singur, West Bengal, protests forced Tata Motors to shift the plant to Sanand, Gujarat. Despite the setbacks, the Nano was launched in 2008.
“None can destroy iron, but its own rust can. Likewise, none can destroy a person but his own mindset can”. A positive mindset is the key to success. The internal factors—negative thoughts, procrastination, self-doubt, lack of confidence, or a defeatist attitude- act as a barrier to achieving potential.
Utilitarianism
: Utilitarianism as a principle advocates that from an ethical point of view, an action is right if the sum total of the utilities produced by a particular act emerges greater than the sum total of utilities generated by any other act. “The greatest good for the greatest number.” said, Jeremy Bentham (the father of Utilitarianism).
The Tata Nano was launched in 2008. Ratan Tata said it was “always meant for all our people”. The Nano was often referred to as India’s first ‘lakhtakia’ – a car that costs all of Rs 1 lakh, a few thousand more expensive than two-wheelers. His vision was an embodiment of utilitarianism and inclusivity.
Philanthropy – Social Responsibility
The Tata Trust, under Ratan Tata, has expanded to reflect a deep sense of social responsibility.
“I admire people who are very successful. But if that success has been achieved through too much ruthlessness, then I may admire that person less”. Success at what cost, should be a prime question to be asked. Role modeling and admiration of a person’s achievement should not be based on materialistic gains especially if it is inhumane.

LIVING PLANET REPORT
Prelims & Mains- ENVIRONMENT
The 2024 Living Planet Index report is out.
The Living Planet Report stresses the need for a collective global effort to tackle the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.
About Living Planet Report
The Living Planet Report is a comprehensive biennial publication by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that assesses the state of the planet’s biodiversity, ecosystems, and the impact of human activity on the natural world.
<img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-198582 size-full" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="615" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kee.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kee.png 902w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kee-300x205.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kee-768x524.png 768w" width="902"/>
Key Findings
Biodiversity Decline: The 2024 report highlights a staggering 73% decline in wildlife populations on average since 1970. This decline is tracked using the Living Planet Index, which monitors thousands of vertebrate species populations globally.
When a population falls below a certain level, that species may not be able to perform its usual role within the ecosystem – whether that’s seed dispersal, pollination, grazing, nutrient cycling or many other processes that keep the ecosystem functioning, the report says.
In India, the decline of three vulture species – white-rumped vulture, Indian vulture, and slender-billed vulture, has been alarming, WWF said.
Ecosystem Health: The report provides a detailed analysis of various ecosystems, including forests, oceans, and freshwater systems, showing significant degradation and loss of habitat.
Human Impact: It emphasizes the role of human activities such as deforestation, pollution, climate change, and overexploitation of resources in driving biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.
Major Themes
Climate Change: The report underscores the urgent need to address climate change, which is exacerbating biodiversity loss and pushing ecosystems towards dangerous tipping points.
Nature-Based Solutions: It advocates for nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change and restore ecosystems, such as reforestation, sustainable agriculture, and conservation efforts.
Sustainable Development: The report calls for integrating biodiversity conservation into sustainable development goals and policies to ensure a balanced approach to economic growth and environmental protection.

FORTIFIED RICE
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
The Union Cabinet recently extended the universal supply of fortified rice in all central government schemes providing free food grain under the National Food Security Act, 2021, in its present form, until December 2028.
The cost of rice fortification is around Rs 2,700 crore per annum — less than 2% of India’s annual total food subsidy bill.
About Rice Fortification
The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) defines fortification as “deliberately increasing the content of essential micronutrients in a food so as to improve the nutritional quality of food and to provide public health benefit with minimal risk to health”.
India has very high levels of malnutrition among women and children. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) conducted between 2019 and 2021, anaemia remains a widespread issue in India.
Besides iron deficiency, other vitamin and mineral deficiencies, such as Vitamin B12 and folic acid, also persist, impacting the overall health and productivity of the population.
Fortification of food is considered to be one of the most suitable methods to combat malnutrition. Rice is consumed by about two-thirds of the population. Per capita rice consumption in India is 6.8 kg per month.
Various technologies, such as coating, dusting, and ‘extrusion’, are available to add micronutrients to regular rice. The last mentioned technology involves the production of fortified rice kernels (FRKs) from a mixture using an ‘extruder’ machine. It is considered to be the best technology for India.
Dry rice flour is mixed with a premix of micronutrients, and water is added to this mixture, which is then passed through a twin-screw extruder with heating zones. Kernels similar in shape and size to rice are produced, which, as per Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution guidelines, must “resemble the normal milled rice as closely as possible”.
The kernels are dried, cooled, and packaged. FRK has a shelf life of at least 12 months. The kernels are blended with regular rice to produce fortified rice.
Fortified rice is packed in jute bags with the logo (‘+F’) and the line “Fortified with Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12”.

**********What is Footrot Disease?
The footrot disease is killing the sheep and goats of Gaddi shepherds in Himachal Pradesh.
About Footrot Disease:
It is a
highly contagious disease
affecting
interdigital (between the toes)
tissue
of ruminants.
It is one of the most common causes of lameness
in cattle and sheep
and can result in serious economic loss.
Once present in a herd/flock, footrot can be very difficult to control.
Causative Agent
: It is caused by the
Dichelobacter nodosus bacteria
in association with a number of other bacteria.
Transmission
Feet infected
with D. nodosus serves as the
source of infection for other cattle
by contaminating the environment.
Infectious agents
gain
entry through
the skin
as a consequence of injury
caused by sharp pieces of stone, metal, wood, stubble, or thorns.
Footrot tends to be
seasonal
, with the
highest incidence
occurring
during the wet seasons.
Symptoms
: Expression of virulent footrot disease includes:
chronic and
severe lesions
loss of production
death, in severe cases.
Treatment
The interdigital tissue should be cleaned, debrided, and disinfected.

**********What is Myopia?
A recent analysis of studies across the world estimates that the global incidence of myopia could exceed 740 million cases in another 25 years.
About Myopia:
Myopia, also known as
nearsightedness,
is an eye condition that
causes
blurry distance vision.
People who are nearsighted have
more trouble seeing things that are far away
(such as when driving) than things that are close up (such as when reading or using a computer).
What causes Myopia?
For normal vision, light passes through the clear cornea at the front of the eye and is focused by the lens onto the surface of the retina, which is the lining of the back of the eye that contains light-sensing cells.
Nearsighted People typically have eyeballs
too long from front to back.
As a result,
entering the eye is
focused too far forward
in front of the retina
instead of on its surface.
It is this change that
causes distant objects to appear blurry.
The
longer the eyeball is
, the
farther forward light rays
will be
and the more
severely nearsighted a person
will be.
Eye experts are still unsure of the exact cause of myopia, but believe it to be a mix of hereditary and environmental factors.
Nearsightedness usually begins in childhood or adolescence.
It tends to
worsen with age until adulthood
, when it may
stop getting worse (stabilize).
In some people, nearsightedness improves in later adulthood.
Symptoms
: Nearsightedness can lead to
squinting
eyestrain
headaches
, and significant
visual impairmen
Treatment
Glasses
contact lenses
can correct myopia in children and adults.
For adults only (with rare exceptions for children), several types of
refractive surgeries
can also correct myopia.
Negative (minus) powered lenses
are used to correct nearsightedness.

**********What is Ardetosaurus viator?
Paleontologists have identified a new genus and species of sauropod dinosaur named Ardetosaurus viator from a semi-articulated specimen found in the 1990s in northern Wyoming, the United States.
About Ardetosaurus viator:
It is a newly discovered
species of dinosaur
that roamed Earth during the
Late Jurassic epoch,
some 150 million years ago.
It was a
type of diplodocid
, a
family of sauropod dinosaurs
that includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the planet.
What are Sauropods?
Sauropods were the
largest of all dinosaurs and the largest land animals that ever lived.
They existed for a minimum of 135 million years, from the
beginning of the Jurassic 201 million years ago
to the
end of the Cretaceous, 66 million years.
Sauropod remains have been found on
every continent
except Antarctica.
They are best recognized by their long necks and long tails, and their success can be attributed to their extreme size, an intricate bird-like air sac system, as well as their
unique feeding
and digestive strategies and
oviparous reproduction
One of the
most recognizable
families is Diplodocidae
These sauropods are generally characterized by their
extremely long necks
even longer tails.
Diplodocids are known from North and South America, Europe, and Africa.

**********Climate Risk Information System
The Reserve Bank of India proposes to create a data repository namely, the Reserve Bank Climate Risk Information System (RB-CRIS)
About
Climate Risk Information System:
It will
bridge the gap in climate-related data
that is currently available in a fragmented manner.
Presently the available climate-related data is characterised by various gaps such as fragmented and varied sources, differing formats, frequencies and units.
It will comprise of
two parts
The first part will be a
web-based directory
, listing various data sources, (meteorological, geospatial, etc.) which will be publicly accessible on the RBI website.
second part
will be a data portal comprising of datasets (processed data in standardised formats).
The RBI plans a
phased launch
of RB-CRIS starting with the web-based directory, followed by a gradual introduction of the data portal for regulated entities to ensure smooth adaptation.
It is crucial for regulated entities
to undertake climate risk assessments
to ensure stability of their balance sheets and that of the financial system.
On February 28, 2024, RBI issued draft guidelines for a 'Disclosure Framework on Climate-Related Financial Risks,' requiring Regulated Entities (REs) to disclose information across four key areas: governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets.
The framework aims to inform stakeholders—such as regulators, investors, and customers—about the climate-related risks faced by REs and their strategies for addressing these issues.

**********Living Planet Report
The Living Planet Report 2024 revealed that the average size of monitored wildlife populations has decreased by 73 per cent since 1970.
About
Living Planet Report:
It is
published biennially
by the
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
It is a comprehensive study of trends in
global biodiversity and the health of the planet
The Living Planet Report 2024 is the 15th edition of the report.
The WWF uses the
Living Planet Index (LPI),
which tracks the
average trends in wildlife
populations rather than focusing on increases or declines in individual species numbers.
By monitoring changes in species population sizes over time, the LPI serves as an early warning indicator of extinction risk and helps assess ecosystem efficiency.
Highlights of the Living Planet Report 2024
sharpest decline
is reported in
freshwater ecosystems
at 85%, followed by
terrestrial ecosystems
at 69% and marine ecosystems at 56%.
WWF highlighted declines in monitored animal populations around the world as follows
Latin America and the Caribbean
, where populations have dropped by 95 per cent
Africa:
76 % decline.
Asia-Pacific region
: 60 % decline.
Central Asia
: 35% decline
North America:
39 % decline.
Major threats to wildlife include
Habitat loss, overexploitation, climate change, pollution, invasive species, and diseases,
which were the dominant drivers of the decline of wildlife.
Habitat loss was driven by unsustainable agriculture, fragmentation, logging, mining, to name a few causes.
Ongoing mass
coral reef bleaching
, affecting over 75 per cent of the world’s reefs, the Amazon rainforest, the collapse of the subpolar gyre and the melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are all
nearing critical tipping points.
More than half of the
United Nations-mandated Sustainable Development Goals
for 2030 are
unlikely to meet their targets
, with 30 per cent of them either already missed or worse off than their 2015 baseline.

**********National Agriculture Code being formulated by Bureau of Indian Standards
Why in news?
The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has begun the process of formulating a National Agriculture Code (NAC), on the lines of the existing National Building Code and National Electrical Code.
What’s in today’s article?
Standardized Agriculture Demonstration Farms
About
BIS is the national standards body of India that sets standards for products and services, and certifies products.
The BIS is a statutory organization that operates under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.
It was established under the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 2016.
HQ
– New Delhi
Objectives
Harmonious development of the activities of standardization, marking and quality certification of goods
To provide thrust to standardization and quality control for growth and development of industry on one hand and to meet the needs of consumers on the other.
Activities:
The activities of BIS can be broadly grouped under the following heads:
Standards formulation
- formulates Indian Standards in line with the national priorities for various sectors
International activities
– India, through BIS, is represented at various international institutions such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) etc.
It is also actively involved in the Regional and Bi-lateral Co-operation Programmes pertaining to standardization, testing, certification, training etc.
World Trade Organisation – Technical Barriers to Trade (WTO-TBT) Matters -
BIS is the National Enquiry Point for WTO -TBT.
Product Certification -
Presence of BIS standard mark (popularly known as ISI mark) on a product indicates conformity to the relevant Indian Standard.
Hallmarking
- Hallmarking of Gold Jewellery was started by BIS in April 2000 to provide third party assurance to consumers on the purity of gold jewellery or its fineness.
Laboratory services
Training services
- National Institute of Training for Standardisation
Consumer Affairs and Publicity
Background
The BIS sets standards for products across economic sectors, including agricultural machinery and inputs like fertilizers and pesticides.
However,
significant areas like agricultural practices, micro-irrigation, and water use remain uncovered by BIS standards
Policymakers have long felt the need for a comprehensive standards framework, which is now being developed by the BIS.
NAC will cover the entire agriculture cycle and provide guidance for future standardization. It will be divided into two parts:
general principles for all crops and
crop-specific standards for paddy, wheat, oilseeds, and pulses.
The NAC aims to guide farmers, agricultural universities, and officials.
Objective of NAC
To develop a national code for agricultural practices that considers agroclimatic zones, crop types, socio-economic diversity, and the entire agri-food value chain.
To promote a quality culture in Indian agriculture by providing a reference for policymakers, agricultural departments, and regulators to incorporate NAC provisions into their schemes, policies, or regulations.
To serve as a comprehensive guide for farmers for informed decision-making in agricultural practices.
To integrate relevant Indian Standards with agricultural recommendations.
To address broader aspects such as SMART farming, sustainability, traceability, and documentation.
To support capacity-building programs organized by agricultural extension services and civil society organizations.
Coverage under NAC
NAC will extend beyond agriculture machinery standards to encompass all agricultural processes and post-harvest operations, including crop selection, land preparation, sowing, irrigation, soil and plant health management, harvesting, processing, and record-keeping.
It will also set standards for input management like the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and weedicides, as well as for crop storage and traceability.
Importantly, the
NAC will address emerging areas such as natural and organic farming, and the use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in agriculture
Proposed timeline
The BIS has developed a strategy to standardize agricultural practices by forming working panels, consisting of university professors and R&D organizations, to draft the National Agricultural Code (NAC) across 12-14 identified areas.
The tentative deadline for completing the NAC is October 2025. Afterward, the BIS plans to train farmers on the NAC and its standards.
Universities have been requested to organize these training programs, with the BIS offering financial assistance for their implementation.
The BIS is setting up 'Standardized Agriculture Demonstration Farms' (SADF) at select agricultural institutes
to test and implement agricultural practices and technologies based on Indian Standards
To develop these farms, the BIS plans to sign MoUs with 10 prominent agricultural institutes, two of which have already been signed, including one with Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology (GBPUAT).
The BIS will provide financial assistance for the farms, which will serve as learning sites for officials, farmers, and industry representatives.
China has already successfully implemented similar SADFs

**********Can India Escape the Middle-Income Trap?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Middle-Income Trap (Meaning, Countries who got out of it, India’s Case, Challenges, Suggestions)
Introduction:
The
World Development Report 2024
, published by the
World Bank
, highlights the challenge of the
middle-income trap
, where countries experience a slowdown in growth as they reach higher income levels.
The report identifies the
3i approach
—
investment, infusion, and innovation
—as essential strategies for countries aiming to transition from middle-income to high-income status.
This approach requires dynamic state policies, particularly relevant to India's ambitions for sustainable economic growth.
What is the Middle-Income Trap?
The middle-income trap refers to the stagnation of per capita income growth when economies reach around
11% of the U.S. per capita income
This phenomenon hinders further progress toward high-income status.
Global Scenario:
Over the last 34 years, only
34 middle-income economies
have successfully transitioned to high-income levels, emphasizing the difficulty of escaping this trap.
Lessons from Other Economies:
South Korea:
State-Driven Growth:
South Korea's escape from the middle-income trap was characterized by a
strong state intervention
The government actively directed private sector activities, focusing on
export-driven growth
Supportive Policies:
Successful companies were rewarded with access to new technologies, while underperforming firms were allowed to fail. This approach ensured that state resources were efficiently allocated.
Role of Chaebols:
South Korean business conglomerates, or
chaebols
, became global leaders in innovation due to their emphasis on investment and technology adoption.
Chile:
Natural Resource Focus:
Chile’s growth was facilitated through targeted state support for
natural resource sectors
, such as the
salmon industry
Export Strategy:
The Chilean government ensured the success of specific export sectors through intervention and support, helping the country to climb up the income ladder.
European Union’s Role:
Most European countries that escaped the middle-income trap benefited from
EU membership
, which facilitated
free movement of capital and labor
—advantages that are not available to non-European nations.
Challenges for India:
Global Economic Headwinds:
The global economic environment has changed significantly since the time of South Korea’s rapid growth. Today,
world export growth
has slowed, and
protectionism
is on the rise, making it difficult for countries like India to access foreign markets.
India also faces the challenge of
premature deindustrialization
, where the contribution of manufacturing to GDP declines at lower levels of income than seen historically.
Stagnation in the Manufacturing Sector:
Despite India's push for industrial growth, the
manufacturing sector
has struggled to become a robust engine of economic expansion.
This has been exacerbated by increased reliance on
agricultural employment
following the pandemic, reversing earlier progress in
structural transformation
Income Disparity and Low Wage Growth:
While India’s GDP growth has been estimated at
around 7%
recently, this growth is not reflected in
real wage increases
Data from the
Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)
shows that nominal wage growth has been around 5-7%, barely keeping up with
inflation
Low wage growth means that
consumption demand
remains weak, which could hinder India’s ability to escape the middle-income trap.
Challenges of Democracy:
Unlike South Korea and Chile, whose export-driven growth models were facilitated by
authoritarian regimes
, India operates within a
democratic framework
This makes it crucial to balance
democratic principles
, such as labor rights and freedom of expression.
Strategies for India’s Transition:
Leveraging Investment and Innovation:
India needs to focus on
enhancing domestic investment
and fostering an environment conducive to
This includes supporting
startups
tech companies
research and development
Encouraging Responsible Business Practices:
For India to follow a path similar to South Korea’s, it is vital to ensure that
is based on
merit
performance
rather than
political connections
This will ensure efficient allocation of resources and avoid crony capitalism.
Strengthening the Service Sector:
With manufacturing facing challenges, India’s
service sector
has the potential to be a key driver of growth.
It is essential to enhance the productivity and global competitiveness of
IT services
healthcare
education
financial services
Inclusive Economic Growth:
Addressing
income inequality
and ensuring that
workers share in economic growth
is critical.
Policies aimed at improving
social safety nets
educational opportunities
can empower more people to participate in India’s growth story.
Conclusion:
India’s journey towards escaping the
is fraught with challenges, from
global economic shifts
domestic structural issues
However, by adopting a balanced approach that combines
investment in innovation
, and adherence to
democratic values
, India can chart a path towards sustainable high-income status.
Examples of countries like
offer valuable lessons, but India must tailor these lessons to suit its unique economic and political context.

**********A Green Transformation of Warming Antarctic Peninsula
Why in News?
The Antarctic Peninsula, a mountainous region pointing toward South America, is
experiencing significant changes due to climate change
.
A recent study has shown that
plant cover in this area has increased dramatically
over the past few decades, raising concerns about the future of this unique ecosystem.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About the Antarctic Peninsula
Key Findings of the Study on Antarctic Peninsula
What are the Impacts of Increased Vegetation in the Antarctic Peninsula?
What are the Implications of Rising Temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula?
Recommendations to Preserve the Integrity of the Antarctica
About the Antarctic Peninsula:
The Antarctic Peninsula is the
northernmost and most accessible part
of the Antarctica continent.
The peninsula’s Antarctic
tundra
features mountainous landscapes, glaciers and ice shelfs.
The west coast of the peninsula, the area most commonly explored, has the mildest weather in all of Antarctica, where the warmest month is January with an average temperature of 1 to 2 °C.
Key Findings of the Study on Antarctic Peninsula:
Rapid increase in vegetation:
Research published in Nature Geoscience reveals that vegetation,
mainly consisting of mosses and lichen
, has expanded significantly.
In 1986, plant life covered less than 1 square kilometer, but by 2021, it had
grown to nearly 12 square kilometers
This is a remarkable
fourteen-fold increase over just 35 years
, with
more than 30% of this growth occurring between 2016 and 2021.
Climate change:
warming at an alarming rate
- five times faster than the global average. The average temperature has
risen nearly 3 degrees Celsius since 1950
This rapid warming is
linked to extreme weather events
, including record-breaking heatwaves.
For example
, in July 2023, some areas experienced temperatures around 10 degrees Celsius higher than usual.
What are the Impacts of Increased Vegetation?
Soil and ecosystem changes:
Mosses can help create soil in an otherwise barren landscape.
This soil formation could make the region
more hospitable for invasive species
, which may threaten local flora and fauna.
The changing landscape is a clear sign of human-induced climate change, even in such a remote area.
Alteration in Albedo effect:
More vegetation could also alter the Antarctic Peninsula's albedo effect, which refers to the ability of surfaces to reflect sunlight.
This change can create a feedback loop
, further accelerating warming and impacting global climate patterns.
What are the Implications of Rising Temperatures?
Ice loss:
A study from 2019 indicated that
the continent has lost 280% more ice mass
in the 2000s and 2010s compared to the previous decades.
The 2024 sea ice extent was reported to be the second smallest on record, only slightly more than the record low set in 2023.
As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise,
the situation is expected to worsen
, leading to more vegetation growth and additional ice loss.
Rising global sea levels:
The loss of ice in Antarctica contributes to rising global sea levels, which poses risks for coastal communities worldwide.
Recommendations to Preserve the Integrity of the Antarctica:
The changes occurring in the Antarctic Peninsula serve as
a stark reminder of the impacts of climate change.
As temperatures rise and vegetation increases,
the delicate balance of this unique ecosystem is at risk.
The consequences of these transformations could have far-reaching effects, not only for Antarctica but for the entire planet.
Addressing climate change
is crucial to mitigate these impacts and preserve the integrity of this remote wilderness.

**********Rise in life expectancy has slowed dramatically: New study
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Life Expectancy and related challenges,
Why in the News?
After decades of steady increases in human life expectancy due to advancements in medicine and technology, recent trends suggest that these gains are starting to slow down, according to a new study.
The Key Findings of the Study:
Slowing of Life Expectancy Gains
: After decades of rising life expectancy due to medical and technological advancements, the pace of these increases has slowed significantly. The study suggests that human life expectancy has nearly plateaued, with dramatic extensions unlikely without breakthroughs in anti-aging medicine.
Regional Analysis
: The study analyzed life expectancy data between
1990 and 2019
from regions with the longest life spans, such as Australia, Japan, and Sweden.
Even in these regions, life expectancy increased by
only 6.5 years on average
over the
29-year period.
Challenges of Radical Life Extension
: Researchers found that while people live longer due to improvements in healthcare, the human body’s aging process—marked by the declining function of internal organs—limits life span. Even if diseases like cancer and heart disease are eliminated, aging itself remains a barrier.
Low Probability of Reaching 100
: The study estimates that girls born in the longest-living regions have only a
5.3% chance of reaching 100 years,
while boys have a
1.8% chance
. Thus, despite medical advancements, reaching 100 years remains rare without interventions to slow aging.
Aging as the Primary Barrier
: Researchers argue that extending average life expectancy dramatically will require breakthroughs that slow the aging process rather than just better treatments for common diseases.
Some experimental drugs, like metformin, have shown potential in animal studies, but human trials are needed.
India’s Present Status:
Lower Life Expectancy
: As of 2024, India’s average life expectancy is around
70 years,
In contrast, countries like Japan and Switzerland boast life expectancies exceeding 83 years.
Healthcare Advancements
: While India has made significant progress in combating infectious diseases and improving maternal and child health, chronic illnesses and lifestyle diseases (such as heart disease and diabetes) are emerging as leading causes of death.
What Needs to Be Done: (Way forward)
Focus on Anti-Aging Research
: India must invest in research on aging and regenerative medicine, exploring ways to slow down the aging process rather than just treating diseases.
Strengthening Healthcare Systems
: Expanding access to quality healthcare and preventive medicine to manage age-related diseases can enhance the quality of life in later years, even if life expectancy does not rise dramatically.
Policy Support for Longevity Research
: There is a need for policies supporting medical research into life-extension technologies, including drug trials and clinical studies focused on aging.
Public Health Interventions
: Improved public health measures targeting lifestyle diseases (obesity, diabetes) and better management of age-related conditions can enhance life span and overall well-being.
Mains PYQ:
The increase in life expectancy in the country has led to newer health challenges in the community. What are those challenges and what steps need to be taken to meet them?

**********Can India escape middle-income trap?
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Inclusive Growth; Middle-income trap;
Why in the News?
The World Development Report 2024 highlights the
“middle-income trap,”
where economies stagnate as growth slows. Only 34 middle-income nations advanced to high-income status in 34 years.
How does the World Bank define the threshold for middle-income economies?
The World Bank defines
as those with
incomes between $1,136 and $13,845 per capita
refers to a slowdown in growth when an economy reaches a certain income threshold, about
11% of U.S. per capita income
Only 34 middle-income countries have transitioned to higher-income status over the last 34 years, indicating the difficulty of escaping the middle-income trap.
Why is state intervention crucial for breaking the middle-income trap?
State intervention
is vital for
coordinating development goals
, as seen in South Korea and Chile, where governments played an active role in shaping industries and ensuring the private sector’s alignment with national development objectives.
The state ensures
investment
infusion of global technologies
, and
domestic innovation
, which are critical for modern economies. This is known as the
3i approach
(Investment, Infusion, Innovation).
State intervention disciplines local elites, ensuring firms succeed based on
performance
, not
political connections
. Underperforming firms are allowed to fail, promoting efficiency and innovation.
What lessons can be drawn from South Korea and Chile?
adopted a
state-led industrialization
strategy with a focus on
export-driven manufacturing
The state actively directed private sector activities, ensuring businesses were competitive on the global stage.
Chaebols
(large business conglomerates) were supported based on their performance, promoting
technological advancement
achieved success by focusing on
natural resource exports
, like its
salmon industry
The state’s role was crucial in developing and supporting industries with growth potential, showing how targeted interventions can help small but strategically important sectors thrive.
What challenges does India face in balancing state intervention with democratic values?
Economic Power Concentration
: India faces a growing concentration of wealth among powerful business houses, which are perceived to be closely linked to the state. This risks
cronyism
rather than performance-based growth, which could hinder innovation and investment.
Manufacturing Stagnation
: Unlike South Korea, India’s manufacturing sector has not experienced significant growth. With global export demand slowing and increased
protectionism
, manufacturing is less likely to drive India’s growth.
Wage Stagnation
: Real wage growth has been stagnant, as inflation erodes the benefits of nominal wage increases. This limits
domestic demand
, a critical factor in economic dynamism.
Premature Deindustrialization
: India, like many developing economies, faces
premature deindustrialization
, meaning that manufacturing’s contribution to GDP is declining at a lower level of income than historically seen in developed economies.
Balancing State Intervention with Democracy
: South Korea and Chile implemented aggressive state interventions under
authoritarian regimes
. However, India, as the world’s largest democracy, must ensure that growth strategies do not come at the cost of
labor rights
World Bank recommendation to escape the middle-income trap:
World Development Report 2024:
This report outlines a three-pronged approach for middle-income countries to escape the trap:
Investment:
Initially focusing on increasing investment.
Technology Infusion:
Incorporating modern technologies into domestic industries.
Innovation:
Ultimately fostering innovation to enhance competitiveness and productivity
Way forward:
Economic Growth Strategy:
Niti Aayog CEO  emphasized the need for a comprehensive economic strategy to avoid the middle-income trap, which he described as the “biggest threat” to India’s growth.
Free Trade and Global Integration:
Niti Aayog CEO advocated for increased openness to free trade and alignment with global value chains.
Urban Development and Infrastructure:
The government should focus on transforming urban areas into economic hubs, which is seen as crucial for driving growth.
**********The grueling course of litigation in India
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Case pendency in judiciary;
Why in the News?
At the National Conference of the District Judiciary,
President Droupadi Murmu
emphasized the problem of court delays. She pointed out that these delays are causing people to hesitate in approaching the courts.
What are the primary causes of delays in the Indian judicial system?
Ineffective Case Management
: The lack of proper scheduling and timelines for filing documents, examining witnesses, and scheduling hearings leads to inefficiencies and prolonged delays.
Lawyers often seek adjournments due to unpredictable scheduling or strategic reasons, leading to repeated postponements of hearings.
Overburdened Judges
: District court judges are often under pressure to prioritize cases based on higher court directives, skewing case management in favor of meeting deadlines rather than ensuring timely justice.
Incentive Structure for Judges
“units system”
rewards judges for disposing of simpler cases, often causing more complex cases to be delayed or neglected.
Extended Stays and Interim Orders
: Litigants may use stays as a strategic delay tactic, reducing the urgency to resolve cases quickly.
Unpredictable Witness Testimonies
: Disruptions in the court schedule and procedural delays make it difficult for witnesses to attend court, further contributing to trial delays.
Status of the
case pending
in India:
Total Pending Cases:
As of 2024, there are over 58.59 lakh cases pending in high courts alone, with a staggering total of more than 51 million (5.1 crore) cases across all court levels, including district and Supreme Court.
Long-standing Cases:
Nearly 62,000 cases have been pending for over 30 years, with some dating back to 1952. In high courts, about 23% of cases have been pending for over ten years
High Court Breakdown:
The Allahabad High Court has the highest backlog, with over seven lakh cases pending as of 2018. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court currently has around 83,000 cases pending, marking a significant increase over the past decade despite an increase in the number of judges
What impact do these delays have on public perception and access to justice?
Erosion of Trust
: Delays make the judicial process appear slow and ineffective, leading to public hesitation in approaching courts, fearing that litigation will complicate their lives.
Increased Legal Costs
: Prolonged cases escalate legal costs for litigants, making justice unaffordable for many.
Reluctance to Seek Justice
“black coat syndrome”
highlights how people avoid courts due to the fear of endless adjournments and delays, diminishing access to timely justice.
Backlog of Cases
: The increasing backlog due to delays creates further congestion in the judicial system, perpetuating a cycle of inefficiency.
How can reforms improve the efficiency of the judiciary? (Way forward)
Improved Case Management Systems
: Implementation of Case Flow Management Rules with a focus on enforcing timelines for hearings and case disposal can streamline the process.
Reformed Incentive Structures
: Reform the “units system” to incentivize judges to handle complex cases more efficiently rather than prioritizing simpler ones.
Predictable Scheduling for Lawyers
: Providing clear scheduling information to lawyers can reduce unnecessary adjournments and improve case flow.
Review of Stay Orders
: Limiting the duration of stay orders and making them subject to regular review can discourage their misuse as delay tactics.
Introducing real-time case management systems to track case progress and monitor delays could enhance judicial efficiency.
Support for Witnesses
: Offering financial compensation and providing predictability in court appearances can encourage witnesses to testify without unnecessary delays.

Synthetic medical images
are AI-generated images created without using traditional imaging devices like
MRI, CT scans
, or
X-rays
These images are constructed using
mathematical models
or AI techniques, such as
generative adversarial networks (GANs)
diffusion models
, and
autoencoders
Advantages offered
Intra- and Inter-Modality Translation:
Generate images from the same or different types of scans, helping when certain scans are unavailable.
Privacy Protection:
Created without patient data, reducing privacy concerns and easing data sharing for research.
Cost and Time Efficiency:
Synthetic images are quicker and cheaper to generate compared to real medical scans.
Scalability:
Easier to produce large volumes of medical data for AI training and research.
Challenges posed
Potential for Misuse:
Could be used to create medical deepfakes, leading to fraudulent claims or fake clinical findings.
Lack of Real-World Complexity:
May not capture subtle details found in real medical data, potentially lowering diagnostic accuracy.
Truth Erosion:
Relying too heavily on synthetic data may distort AI models, leading to diagnoses that don’t align with real-world cases.
Ethical and Regulatory Concerns:
Questions around how these images should be controlled and monitored to avoid misuse.
