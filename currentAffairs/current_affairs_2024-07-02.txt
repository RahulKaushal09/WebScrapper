NATIONAL PARTY STATUS
Syllabus
Prelims & Mains – Polity
Context:
With no elected MP in Lok Sabha and its vote share this general election down to 2.04%, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) could lose its national status once the Election Commission carries out its customary review post general elections.
Background:-
Founded in 1984 by Kanshi Ram who later named Mayawati as his successor, BSP was recognised as a national party in 1997.
Key takeaways
Currently, there are six political parties recognised as national parties by the Election Commission – BJP, BSP, Congress, AAP, National People’s Party, and CPM.
According to the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, a national party is one that has :
at least 6% of the total valid votes in four or more states in the last general election and at least four MPs;
or wins at least 2% of the seats in the Lok Sabha, with the winners being from at least three states;
or is a recognised state party in at least four states.
With the party failing to win any seat in the 18th Lok Sabha and getting only 2.04% of the total votes, as per the results available on the ECI website, it fails the first two criteria for retaining its national party status. The final results and statistics for the 2024 elections are yet to be published.
For the third criterion, the party has to meet the conditions for being a recognised state party in four or more states, which it also does not meet as of now.
In all state Assembly elections held between 2019 and now, the BSP meets the criteria for being a state party only in Uttar Pradesh, where it won 12.88% votes in the 2022 state polls. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, it met the state party criteria, of having at least 8% of the valid votes polled in a particular state, in Uttar Pradesh, where it got 9.39% of the votes.
As per the Symbols Order, a state party is one which has got :
at least 6% of the total valid votes in a state and at least two MLAs;
or at least 6% of the total valid votes polled in the state in the last Lok Sabha elections and at least one MP from that state;
or at least 3% of the total seats in the Assembly or three seats, whichever is higher;
or at least one MP for every 25 seats allotted to that state in the Lok Sabha;
or at least 8% of the total valid votes in the last Lok Sabha election in that particular state or Assembly election.
This is not the first time that BSP’s national status is under scanner. In 2014, when it also had no seat in Lok Sabha and 4.19% vote share, it could have lost its national party status, but an amendment made by EC in 2016 came to its rescue.
Post the 2014 elections, the Symbols Order was amended in 2016 with effect from January 1, 2014 saying that a party’s national or state recognition would not be reviewed in the first election after the one in which they gain the status, meaning the first review would be after 10 years. This benefit was given to all parties, even the BSP, which became a national party in 1997.
As a national party, a political party gets certain benefits, including the guaranteed use of their common election symbol for candidates across the country, land or accommodation for an office in Delhi, free copies of the electoral roll and airtime on Doordarshan and All-India Radio during elections.

AI WASHING
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Soon after the release of ChatGPT in 2022, there was an explosion of news and a surge of interest in AI, triggering a hype cycle that continues unabated. Suddenly, it seems every tech company or startup is marketing an AI product. Tech companies and startups marketing themselves as using AI, but not doing so forms the basis of ‘AI washing’
The summit will take place from July 3-4 in Astana. Kazakhstan took over the SCO presidency from India, which was the president last year. India hosted the SCO summit virtually in July 2023.
About AI WASHING
AI washing is a term derived from greenwashing, where companies exaggerate their environmental friendliness to appeal to customers. Similarly, businesses that claim to have integrated AI into their products, when they’re actually using less sophisticated technology, can be accused of AI washing.
When it comes to AI washing, there are several types. Some companies claim to use AI when they’re actually using less-sophisticated computing, while others overstate the efficacy of their AI over existing techniques, or suggest that their AI solutions are fully operational when they are not.
While it is unclear who coined the term AI washing, it was popularised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when it levied fines againstinvestment advisory firms Global Predictions and Delphia in March 2024.
The securities regulator found that the companies had made false statements to their clients about providing ‘expert AI-driven forecasts’ and using machine learning to manage retail client portfolios.
What are some real-life examples of AI washing?
Recently, Amazon reportedly removed its cashier-less checkout systems from many physical grocery stores afterBusiness Insider found that the ‘Just Walk Out’ technology, which claimed to use AI and sensors to detect what was in a customer’s shopping cart, actually relied on employees in India to review the transactions.
Not just tech companies, the AI-related claims of multinational brands such asMcDonalds and Coca Cola have also come under scrutiny.
McDonalds recently decided to ditch its AI technology at drive-thru restaurants in the US after customers complained that their orders had been incorrectly taken down.
The rush to be branded as an AI business follows a long pattern of companies looking to capitalise on the hype surrounding new and emerging technologies.
Why is AI washing a growing concern?
While AI washing may seem like harmless hyperbole, it could have far-reaching consequences for consumers and the tech industry itself.
AI washing diverts management attention and resources away from practical AI innovation. Instead of developing meaningful AI capabilities, companies might make misguided investments in superficial enhancements, slowing real progress with the technology.
AI washing can complicate decision making for businesses that are genuinely looking for valuable AI solutions. This can hinder their digital transformation efforts, stifle innovation, and jeopardise performance.
As for consumers, subpar AI technology could pose data security and privacy risks while additionally pushing consumers away from using the technology.

SNOWBLIND MALWARE
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
A new Android malware called Snowblind has emerged and it’s using a clever trick  to bypass security.
Snowblind specifically targets apps that handle sensitive user information.
About Snowblind Malware:
Snowblind is a type of Trojan malware that targets Android devices.
Discovered by cybersecurity firm Promon, this malicious software masquerades as legitimate software to infiltrate Android phones and tablets.
Once installed, it remains dormant until triggered by specific actions or commands. Its stealthy approach allows it to avoid detection by users and security software.
When activated, Snowblind is capable of capturing your banking login credentials and performing unauthorized transactions without your consent.
How it gets into your system
People usually get this virus by downloading a malicious app that looks legitimate. The malware repackages an app to avoid detection and misuses accessibility features to steal sensitive information and control the app remotely, said Vidar Krey, VP of engineering at Promon.
How does Snowblind malware work?
Unlike other Android malware, Snowblind bypasses Android’s built-in security by exploiting a feature called “seccomp” in the Linux kernel, which is supposed to check for tampering.
Snowblind injects code before seccomp activates, allowing it to bypass security checks and use accessibility services to monitor your screen, making it easier to steal your login information or interrupt your banking app sessions.
This lets it disable biometric and two-factor authentication (2FA) protections, putting you at higher risk for fraud and identity theft. The malware works quietly in the background, so you might not even realise it is on your device.

PENCH TIGER RESERVE
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
The Pench Tiger Reserve recently launched an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) system for the early detection of forest fires.
The use of AI for early forest fire detection can significantly improve response times and help protect wildlife and habitats.
About PENCH TIGER RESERVE
The Pench Tiger Reserve is named after the Pench River.
Inside the park, the river flows from North to South before going on to join the Kanhan River, while splitting the Park into two, and forming the boundary of Seoni District and Chhindwara District districts of Madhya Pradesh.
The Meghdoot dam built across Pench River at Totladoh has created a large water body of 72 km2 out of which 54 km2 falls in M.P. and the rest in the adjoining state of Maharashtra.
The Pench River which emerges from Mahadeo Hills of Satpuda Ranges and the various nallas and streams which drain into it, all flow through the forests of the protected area.
The Pench Tiger Reserve spans the southern reaches of the Satpura hills in the Seoni and Chhindwara districts of Madhya Pradesh.
It also extends into the Nagpur district in Maharashtra.
Biodiversity:
This reserve is home to a rich variety of flora and fauna.
Tigers are the main attraction, but it also hosts large herds of Chital, Sambar, Nilgai, and Gaur (Indian Bison).
The area supports over 325 species of resident and migratory birds, including the Malabar Pied Hornbill, Indian Pitta, Osprey, and Grey Headed Fishing Eagle.
Vegetation:
The undulating terrain features a mosaic of vegetation, ranging from moist sheltered valleys to open, dry deciduous forests.
Teak, saag, mahua, and various grasses and shrubs thrive here.
The Pench region is the real-life setting of Rudyard Kipling’s famous novel, “The Jungle Book”.

Financial Stability Board (FSB) Support
Played a crucial role in the establishment and support of the FSB, which coordinates international efforts to enhance global financial stability and regulatory reforms in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
Background
RBI has been working bilaterally with various countries to link India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with their Fast Payments Systems (FPSs) for cross-border Person to Person (P2P) and Person to Merchant (P2M) payments.
While these bilateral connections are beneficial, a multilateral approach could significantly enhance the international reach of Indian payment systems.
Currently, over 70 countries have instant payment systems that enable domestic payments to reach their destination in seconds at near-zero cost.
By interconnecting these systems, cross-border payments can be completed within 60 seconds in most cases.
Project Nexus is conceptualised by the Innovation Hub of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
It seeks to enhance cross-border payments by connecting multiple domestic instant payment systems (IPS) globally.
It is the first BIS Innovation Hub project in the payments area to move towards live implementation.
Benefits
Project Nexus aims to standardize the interconnection of Instant Payment Systems (IPS).
Instead of each payment system operator creating custom connections for every new country, they can connect once to the Nexus platform.
This single connection enables access to all other countries on the network, potentially accelerating the growth of instant cross-border payments.
Countries that have joined the platform
Project Nexus aims to connect the FPSs of four Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) — Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand; and India.
These countries would be the founding members and first mover countries of this platform.
Indonesia will also join the platform in future.

**********Lok Sabha Speaker vs Opposition over muting of mics
Why in news?
In the new Parliament Session, Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi claimed for the second time that his microphone had been switched off during his address. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, however, clarified that presiding officers do not have any means to turn off members' microphones and objected to accusations against the Chair.
What’s in today’s article?
Who controls the mic in Parliament?
Previous row over muting mics
Muting Mics and breach of privilege
Microphone and Switch System in the House
Each MP has an assigned seat in the House. All the members have a microphone and switch set at their specific desks with allocated numbers.
According to the manual released by the Lok Sabha Secretariat in May 2014, the switch board has multiple switches in different colours.
Activation of mic when an MP wants to speak
If an MP wants to speak in the House, they can raise their hand to notify the presiding officer and press the grey button.
The LED on microphones turns red when the mic is activated.
The microphone is activated from the control room only
when the member has been permitted by the Speaker to speak
Control Room Operations
As per various media reports, both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have a chamber for sound technicians, who are part of the staff that transcribes and records the proceedings of Parliament.
The chamber has an electronic board with assigned seat numbers of the members.
Mics are turned on and off from this room
, which has a glass facade through which the staff can see the presiding officers and the MPs.
Microphones are activated under the directions of the Chair of the Rajya Sabha/Lok Sabha.
They are only turned on when a member is called by the Chair
A member’s mic might be switched off if it is not their turn to speak.
Speaking Rules and Time Limits
In the Zero Hour, a three-minute time limit is given to a member, and when the three minutes are over, the
microphone is automatically switched off
In cases of debates on bills, time is allocated for each party. The Chair adheres to this time and,
at its discretion, grants one or two minutes for a member to complete
Only the Lok Sabha Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairman can direct the switching on and off of mics in special circumstances
In case of Special Mentions
In the case of Special Mentions, MPs have a limit of reading out 250 words. The moment it is read by the member
, the microphone is switched off by the staff in the chamber
Special Mentions allow Members of Parliament (MPs) to raise matters of public importance or grievances in the House without prior notice.
These mentions are used for issues that require the immediate attention of the government or the public.
Last week, Rahul Gandhi claimed that his microphone was switched off as he tried to raise the issue of NEET irregularities.
In July 2023, Congress chief and Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, claimed that his microphone was switched off while he was speaking in the upper house.
He described this incident as a breach of his privilege and an insult to his self-respect.
Constitutional Provisions
Article 105
: Defines the powers, privileges, and immunities of Parliament, its members, and committees.
Article 194
: Defines similar powers, privileges, and immunities for State Legislatures, their members, and committees.
It is considered a breach of privilege and contempt of the House to make speeches or publish libel that reflects on the character or proceedings of the House, its Committees, or any member related to their character or conduct as a legislator.
Lack of codification
The Constitution has accorded special privileges and powers to parliamentarians and legislators so as to maintain the dignity and authority of the Houses.
However,
these powers and privileges are not codified
Thus, there are no clear, notified rules to decide what constitutes a breach of privilege, and the punishment it attracts.

**********Agenda of the 16th Finance Commission
Why in the News?
The 16th Finance Commission (FC), under the chairmanship of Dr. Arvind Panagariya, focuses on devolution to local bodies, highlighting challenges in urban fiscal devolution in India.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (About FC, Composition, Functions, Role, etc.)
News Summary
Background:
Article 270
of the Constitution provides for the scheme of distribution of net tax proceeds collected by the Union government between the Centre and the States.
The taxes that are shared between the Centre and the States include corporation tax, personal income tax, Central GST, the Centre’s share of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) etc.
This division is based on the recommendation of the
(FC) that is constituted every five years as per the terms of
Article 280
Apart from the share of taxes, States are also provided grants-in-aid as per the recommendation of the FC.
The divisible pool, however, does not include cess and surcharge that are levied by the Centre.
About Finance Commission:
The FC is constituted every five years and is a body that is exclusively constituted by the Union Government.
It consists of a chairman and four other members who are appointed by the President.
Finance Commission (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1951
, has specified the qualifications for chairman and other members of the commission.
The Union government has notified the constitution of the
Finance Commission under the chairmanship of Dr. Arvind Panagariya
for making its recommendations for the period of
2026-31
Composition of the Finance Commission:
Chairman
: The Commission is headed by a Chairman who is selected from among individuals with experience in public affairs.
Members
: There are four other members who are appointed by the President of India. The qualifications for these members include:
A person who is or has been a judge of a High Court or qualified to be appointed as one.
A person with knowledge of finance and accounts of the government.
A person with experience in financial matters and administration.
A person with special knowledge of economics.
Functions of the Finance Commission:
Distribution of Net Proceeds
: Recommend how the net proceeds of taxes should be distributed between the Centre and the states, and the allocation of the same among the states.
Grants-in-Aid
: Determine the principles governing the grants-in-aid to the states by the Centre from the Consolidated Fund of India.
Improving Fiscal Management
: Suggest measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a state to supplement the resources of the Panchayats and Municipalities in the state.
Any Other Matter
: Address any other matter referred to it by the President in the interests of sound finance.
Are Recommendations Made by the Commission Binding?
The recommendations made by the Finance Commission are of an advisory nature only and therefore,
not binding upon the government
It is up to the Government to implement its recommendations on granting money to the states.
Agenda of the 16th Finance Commission:
The 16th Finance Commission (FC) has begun its work, primarily focusing on the devolution of the consolidated fund.
Since the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local bodies have gained significant recognition within the federal system.
These amendments introduced sub-clauses 280(3)(bb) and (c), which mandate the FC to recommend measures to augment State consolidated funds for supporting panchayats and municipalities.
About Urban Areas:
Cities, contributing around 66% of India's GDP and 90% of government revenues, are crucial for national development.
Despite their importance, financial support for urban areas remains insufficient.
The World Bank estimates $840 billion is needed for urban infrastructure over the next decade.
Intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in India are only about 0.5% of GDP
, significantly lower than in other developing countries.
This inadequate financial devolution hampers city productivity and quality of life. IGTs, although vital, need to be more predictable and equitable to support ULBs effectively.
Need for Increase in IGTs:
introduction of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) has reduced ULBs’ tax revenue (excluding property tax) from about 23% in 2012-13 to around 9% in 2017-18
IGTs from States to ULBs are very low, with State Finance Commissions recommending only about 7% of States’ own revenue in 2018-19. Increasing the quantum of IGTs as a percentage of GDP is necessary.
Need for the Updated Census Data:
Without the 2021 Census, relying on 2011 data for fiscal planning is inadequate.
India has about 4,000 statutory towns, an equal number of Census towns, and around 23,000 villages that are essentially urban.
The 16th Finance Commission must consider this and the migration to Tier-2 and 3 cities.
The 15th FC’s principles need revisiting, particularly regarding property tax, GST alignment, pollution mitigation, primary healthcare, and essential services.
The 16th FC should aim to double IGTs to urban areas.

**********What is Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Device
Why in News?
A UK-based teenager has become the first person in the world to be fitted with a brain implant - deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, to help bring his epileptic seizures under control.
The DBS device sends electrical signals deep into the brain and has reportedly reduced his daytime seizures by 80%.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is Epilepsy?
What is Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)?
Other Alternatives to Treat Epilepsy
How Popular is DBS?
The word epilepsy simply means "
seizure disorders
."
Seizures
are sudden surges of abnormal and excessive electrical activity in one’s brain and can affect how one appears or acts.
Epilepsy is a brain disorder
that causes recurring, unprovoked seizures.
A person experiences jerking of arms and legs, temporary confusion, staring spells or stiff muscles during seizures.
It can increase the risk of accidents, drownings, and falling.
The disease has no identifiable cause
in nearly 50% of the cases.
However, head trauma, tumours in the brain, some infections like meningitis, or even genetics can lead to epilepsy.
According to a 2022 Lancet study, between 3 and 11.9 per 1,000 people suffer from epilepsy in
India
Although several anti-seizure medicines are available in the market,
30% of the patients remain resistant to treatment.
About:
DBS is
a neurosurgical procedure
that uses implanted electrodes and electrical stimulation to treat movement disorders associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), essential tremor, dystonia and other neurological conditions.
Working:
interrupts the irregular signals
that cause tremors and other movement symptoms.
Neurosurgeons implant one or more wires/ leads inside the brain.
The leads are connected with an insulated wire extension to a very small neurostimulator (electrical generator) implanted under the person’s collarbone, similar to a heart pacemaker.
Continuous pulses of electric current from the neurostimulator pass through the leads and into the brain.
The doctor programs it to deliver an electrical signal and ensure that the current is properly adjusted to provide effective results.
In adjusting the device, the doctor seeks an optimal balance between improving symptom control and limiting side effects.
Other Alternatives to Treat Epilepsy:
DBS is not the first line of treatment for epilepsy.
Doctors first use anti-seizure medicines
and a ketogenic diet, which is high in fats and low in carbohydrates.
If that does not work,
doctors can carry out brain surgery
to remove a portion of the brain where the seizures originate.
Another surgery called
corpus callosotomy
(doctors remove a part disallowing abnormal electrical signals to travel from one half of the brain to another) may be suggested in some children.
Surgery is still preferable to implanting a DBS device
This is because DBS devices available in the market reduce seizures by around 40%.
In comparison, seizures drop by nearly 90% if the patient undergoes surgery.
DBS/ neurostimulators cost about Rs 12 lakh
and there are additional surgical costs that one has to pay in private hospitals, increasing the cost to about Rs 17 lakh.
In comparison, a brain surgery costs between Rs 2 and 3 lakhs.
Therefore,
such devices should be suggested only for those
who have epilepsy which originates from different parts of the brain (instead of one focal point), making operations less viable.

**********What are hurricanes, their types?    
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Difference between a hurricane and a tropical storm
Mains level:
What are hurricanes and how do they form?
Why in the news?
Due to Hurricane Beryl sweeping through the Windward Islands, the Indian Men’s cricket team, victorious in the T20 World Cup, finds itself stranded in Barbados.
What do we know about Hurricane Beryl?
Early Category 4 Storm:
Hurricane Beryl is the earliest category 4 storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, sustaining winds of at least 130 miles per hour (209 kilometres per hour).
Location and Impact:
It is currently affecting the Windward Islands in the southern part of the Lesser Antilles, including Barbados, Grenada, and Trinidad and Tobago.
Forecast:
The National Hurricane Centre has issued warnings for life-threatening winds and storm surges in the affected islands, with the potential for violent winds and flash flooding.
Preparations:
Local authorities in Barbados have suspended school classes and taken other precautions, such as shutting down the water supply, in anticipation of the hurricane’s impact.
Historical Context:
Hurricane Beryl is noted as the strongest storm to impact the Windward Islands since Hurricane Ivan in September 2004.
Formation:
Hurricanes form over warm ocean waters near the equator where warm, moist air rises from the ocean’s surface, creating low air pressure.
Fuel:
They are fueled by the heat and moisture evaporating from the ocean, forming clouds and spinning due to the Earth’s rotation.
Eye Formation:
As the storm system intensifies, an eye forms at its centre, with storms rotating counterclockwise north of the equator and clockwise south of it.
Impact of Warming World:
Warmer sea surface temperatures due to climate change may lead to slower decay of hurricanes upon landfall, potentially increasing their severity.
Are hurricanes becoming more severe now?
Research Findings:
Studies suggest that warmer sea surface temperatures contribute to the slower decay of hurricanes, potentially prolonging their destructive impacts inland.
Record-Breaking Seasons:
The 2020 Atlantic Hurricane season has seen a record number of named storms, indicating a trend towards more frequent and intense hurricane activity.
What is the difference between a hurricane and a tropical storm?
No Fundamental Difference:
Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones are all types of tropical cyclones, named differently based on their location:
Hurricanes:
Form over the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Pacific Ocean.
Typhoons:
Form in the Northwest Pacific Ocean.
Cyclones:
Form in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
Naming Conventions:
The different names signify regional differences but refer to the same meteorological phenomenon of tropical cyclones.
Way forward:
Implementation of Advanced Forecasting Technologies:
Invest in state-of-the-art meteorological tools and satellite technology to enhance the accuracy and lead time of hurricane forecasts.
Community Preparedness Programs:
Establish comprehensive community outreach programs to educate residents about hurricane risks, evacuation procedures, and emergency shelter locations.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the meaning of colour-coded weather warnings for cyclone prone areas given by India Meteorological Department.

Role of Finance Commission
Why in the news?
The 16th Finance Commission, under Article 280, focuses on devolving funds. Amendments like 73rd and 74th mandate it to bolster state funds for panchayats and municipalities.
About 16th Finance Commission
The 16th Finance Commission of India was constituted on December 31, 2023, with Dr. Arvind Panagariya as its Chairman.
The President of India appointed the Commission in pursuance of Article 280(1) of the Constitution
How do other countries devolve funds to their local governments?
International Comparison:
Countries like South Africa, Mexico, the Philippines, and Brazil allocate significantly higher percentages of their GDP (1.6% to 5.1%) to urban local bodies compared to India’s 0.5%.
Importance of Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs):
IGTs make up about 40% of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) revenue in India but suffer from unpredictability, lack of earmarking for vulnerable groups, and horizontal equity.
Financial Health of ULBs:
Despite efforts by multiple Finance Commissions, financial devolution to cities in India remains inadequate, affecting city productivity and quality of life.
Why is the Census significant?
Data Dependence:
The absence of the 2021 Census data makes it challenging to accurately assess urban growth and demographic changes crucial for evidence-based fiscal devolution.
Urban Dynamics:
India has approximately 4,000 statutory towns, an equal number of Census towns, and a large number of effectively urban villages, which need accurate enumeration for effective planning and resource allocation.
Migration Impact:
The Census data is essential to capture the significant migration to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, impacting their infrastructure and service needs.
What about cities and the Taxation system?
Impact of GST:
The introduction of GST has reduced ULBs’ tax revenue (excluding property tax) significantly, impacting their financial autonomy.
Low IGTs:
Intergovernmental transfers from States to ULBs in India are minimal (around 0.5% of GDP), much lower than other developing nations, exacerbating fiscal challenges.
Constitutional Provisions:
Despite the 74th constitutional amendment aimed at empowering ULBs, progress has been limited over three decades, hampering urban development.
Parallel Agencies:
The growth of parallel agencies and schemes like MP/MLA Local Area Development Schemes distort the federal structure and weaken ULBs’ financial and operational autonomy.
Way forward:
Enhanced Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs):
Increase IGTs from States to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to at least 2% of GDP, ensuring predictability and earmarking for vulnerable groups.
Reform in Urban Governance and Fiscal Autonomy:
Strengthen constitutional provisions to empower ULBs further, reducing dependence on parallel agencies like MP/MLA Local Area Development Schemes.

**********At the end of Pride Month, assessing the LGBTQIA+ communities’ rights   
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Varying rights and status of LGBTQIA+ communities across the world
Why in the news?
Every June, Pride Month is celebrated globally to honour the contributions of LGBTQIA+ community members and to promote love, diversity, and acceptance.
Varying rights and status of LGBTQIA+ communities across the world:
Legalization and Criminalization of Same-Sex Acts:
The legal status of same-sex acts varies significantly while 37 countries have fully legalized same-sex marriage, 59 countries still penalize any expression of queerness, with severe punishments in some regions.
Marriage Rights:
Same-sex marriage is legal in 37 countries, banned in 79 countries, and in some places, same-sex couples can only opt for civil unions, leaving their status partially recognized.
Employee Protections:
Legal protections for queer employees are inconsistent. While 27 countries offer legal aid based on sexual orientation, 90 countries lack any legal protections for queer employees. India and three other countries provide legal aid based on gender identity, including transgender persons.
Adoption Rights:
Adoption rights for same-sex couples also vary. In 39 countries, same-sex parents can adopt children, while 45 countries ban this practice. In 100 countries, single parents can adopt under certain conditions, similar to India’s laws.
Social and Legal Challenges:
Despite legal advancements in some areas, LGBTQIA+ individuals globally continue to face significant social and legal challenges, including discrimination, harassment, and exclusion, with varying levels of legal aid and recognition depending on the country.
Indian Scenario
Decriminalization of Homosexuality:
In 2018, the Supreme Court of India partially struck down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, decriminalizing homosexuality. Same-sex couples have the right to cohabitation but not to legal marriage or unions.
Discrimination and Harassment:
Queer individuals in India still face significant discrimination, harassment, and exclusion.
Legal Protections for Transgender and Intersex Individuals:
The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, prohibits unfair treatment in employment, education, healthcare, public facilities, and residence. Legal recourse is available for discrimination based on gender identity but not sexual orientation.
Same-sex couples cannot be recognized as co-parents to an adopted child. Single prospective adoptive parents, regardless of marital status, are allowed to adopt under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
Way forward:
Expand Legal Recognition:
Countries should work towards fully recognizing same-sex marriages and providing comprehensive legal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
Education and Awareness:
Implement nationwide educational programs to raise awareness about LGBTQIA+ issues, combat stereotypes, and promote understanding and acceptance. This can involve incorporating LGBTQIA+ history and rights into school curriculums and conducting public awareness campaigns.
Economic Opportunities:
Ensure equal opportunities in the workplace by promoting diversity and inclusion policies, providing sensitivity training for employers, and supporting LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs. Governments and organizations can offer grants, mentorship programs, and other resources to empower LGBTQIA+ individuals economically.

Prelims level:
Megafauna, Archaeological evidence of Ostrichs in India
PC: India Today
Why in the News?
Archaeologists have discovered a
41,000-year-old ostrich nest in Prakasam
Andhra Pradesh
.
Prehistoric Ostrich Nest: Details of the Discovery
The nest, identified as the
world’s oldest known
ostrich nest, measures 9-10 feet in width.
The nest was
once home to 9-11 eggs
but was capable of holding 30-40 eggs at a time.
Ostriches are
mega omnivores
, weighing between
90 and 140 kg
and standing
seven to nine feet tall
What are Megafauna?
Megafauna generally refers to
animals weighing more than 50 kg
, though scientific definitions vary.
The term was
first used
by
Alfred Russel Wallace
in his
1876
book,
“The Geographical Distribution of Animals.”
Megafauna can be classified into:
Megaherbivores
(plant-eaters),
Megacarnivores
(meat-eaters), and
Megaomnivores
(who eat both plants and meat).
Historical Evidence of Megafauna
Early Documentation
: Richard Lydekker in 1884 presented the earliest documented evidence of ostriches in the subcontinent, identifying the extinct Struthio asiaticus in the
Dhok Pathan deposits in Upper Siwalik Hills
, present-day Pakistan.
Discoveries in Maharashtra
: Archaeologist S A Sali in 1989 reported ostrich eggshell beads and engraved pieces dating back to 50,000–40,000 years ago at Patne, Maharashtra.
CCMB Research in 2017
: Researchers at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad established the presence of ostriches in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat 25,000 years ago.
Broader Implications and Studies
Biogeographical Dispersion
: The presence of ostriches in India is attributed to bio-geographical dispersion from the continental drifting of Gondwanaland.
Late Quaternary Extinctions
: The study, titled ‘Late Quaternary extinctions in the Indian Subcontinent,’ established that the disappearance of large animals began around 30,000 years ago, coinciding with the arrival of humans.
Co-Evolution Hypothesis
: The study supports the hypothesis that fauna and their resilience to extinction resulted from coevolution with hominins, with geographic isolation and abiotic factors accelerating extinction.
PYQ:
[2018]
The term “sixth mass extinction/sixth extinction” is often mentioned in the news in the context of the discussion of:
(a) Widespread monoculture practices in agriculture and large-scale commercial farming with indiscriminate use of chemicals in many parts of the world that may result in the loss of good native ecosystems.
(b) Fears of a possible collision of a meteorite with the Earth in the near future in the manner it happened 65 million years ago that caused the mass extinction of many species including those of dinosaurs.
(c) Large-scale cultivation of genetically modified crops in many parts of the world and promoting their cultivation in other parts of the world which may cause the disappearance of good native crop plants and the loss of food biodiversity.
(d) Mankind’s over-exploitation/misuse of natural resources, fragmentation/loss of natural habitats, destruction of ecosystems, pollution and global climate change.
