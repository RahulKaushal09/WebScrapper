SUB-CLASSIFICATION OF SC, ST
Syllabus
Mains – GS 2
Context:
In a landmark judgement, a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on August 1 reframed how the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) quota may operate. The Bench headed by Chief Justice of India permitted states to create sub-classifications within the SC and ST categories for the purpose of according wider protections — through sub-quotas — to the most backward communities within these categories.
Background:-
This overturns the apex court’s 2004 decision in E V Chinnaiah v State of Andhra Pradesh, in which it had held that the SC/ST list is a “homogenous group” that cannot be divided or sub-classified further.
Key takeaways
Article 341 of the Constitution allows the President, through a notification, to list as SC “castes, races or tribes” that suffered from untouchability. SC groups are jointly accorded 15% reservation in education and public employment.
Over time, some groups within the SC list have been underrepresented compared to others, prompting states to try extending more protections to these groups. These attempts have faced judicial scrutiny.
In 1975, Punjab issued a notification giving first preference in SC reservations to the Balmiki and Mazhabi Sikh communities. This was challenged following the Supreme Court’s 2004 decision in E V Chinnaiah, which struck down a similar law in Andhra Pradesh.
V Chinnaiah judgement: The court held that any attempts to create a differentiation within the SC list would essentially amount to tinkering with it, for which the Constitution did not empower states. Article 341 only empowers the President to issue such a notification, and Parliament to make additions or deletions to the list. The court also said that sub-classifying SCs violates the right to equality under Article 14.
In 2006, the Punjab & Haryana High Court struck down Punjab’s 1975 notification in Dr. Kishan Pal v State of Punjab.
Despite this, Punjab reintroduced the first preference in the Punjab Scheduled Caste and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006. This Act was challenged, leading to the High Court striking it down in 2010, and an appeal to the Supreme Court. In 2014, the case was referred to a five-judge Constitution Bench to determine if the E V Chinnaiah decision had to be reconsidered.
In 2020, Constitution Bench in Davinder Singh v State of Punjab held that the 2004 E V Chinnaiah decision required reconsideration, noting that SCs are not a homogeneous group and that there are unequals within SC’s, ST’s, and socially and educationally backward classes. But since this Bench, like in E V Chinnaiah, comprised five judges, a seven-judge Bench heard the issue in February 2024.
Key issues before the Bench included:
Are all castes in the SC list to be treated similarly?
: Article 341(1) allows the President to specify SCs in a state. Article 341(2) states that only Parliament can modify this list. E V Chinnaiah decision held that SCs must be treated identically. However, CJI Chandrachud rejected this, stating that the Presidential list is a “legal fiction” and does not imply uniformity within the SCs.
Can states ‘tinker’ with or sub-classify the Presidential list?
: The court, in E V Chinnaiah, had held that the power under articles 15(4) & 16 (4) was limited to providing quotas in education and public employment and once reservations have been provided to SCs as a whole, it is not open to the State to sub-classify. The majority opinion in the present case held that states in exercise of its power under Articles 15 & 16 can identify varying degrees of social backwardness and provide special provisions, including sub-quotas.
What is the yardstick for sub-classification?:
States must demonstrate the need for wider protections, provide empirical evidence, and have a reasonable rationale for classifying sub-groups. This reasoning can be tested in court. Representation must be “effective” rather than merely “numerical,” and states must prove the disadvantaged status of sub-groups based on quantifiable data.
Does the creamy layer principle apply to Scheduled Castes?:
Justice Gavai supported introducing the ‘creamy layer’ principle for SCs, as applied to OBCs, to ensure that only the most disadvantaged benefit from reservations. Four of the seven judges agreed with this opinion.
In conclusion, the Supreme Court’s decision reflects a nuanced approach to SC reservations, recognizing internal disparities within SCs and allowing states to address them with appropriate measures backed by evidence.

CLOUDBURSTS
Prelims & Mains – GEOGRAPHY
Several cloudbursts occurred in Himachal Pradesh recently. Five people have died and around 50 are missing.
The cloudbursts also triggered flash floods that washed away several buildings, bridges, and roads cutting off several areas.
About cloudbursts
A cloudburst is a localised but intense rainfall activity.
Not all instances of very heavy rainfall, however, are cloudbursts. A cloudburst has a very specific definition: Rainfall of 10 cm or more in an hour over a roughly 10 km x 10-km area is classified as a cloudburst event. By this definition, 5 cm of rainfall in a half- hour period over the same area would also be categorized as a cloudburst.
Causes
Orographic Lift: Cloudbursts frequently occur in mountainous regions where moist air is forced to rise over a mountain, cooling and condensing rapidly.
Convective Clouds: They can also result from convective clouds, such as cumulonimbus clouds, which can extend up to 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) above the ground.
Sudden Condensation: When warm air mixes with cooler air, it can lead to rapid condensation and precipitation.
Effects
Flooding: The intense rainfall can lead to flash floods, causing significant damage to infrastructure and posing risks to life.
Disasters: Cloudbursts can result in landslides, especially in hilly areas, further exacerbating the damage.
Detection and Forecasting
Challenges: Detecting cloudbursts is challenging due to their small scale. Satellite precipitation radars often miss them, and weather models struggle to simulate them accurately.
Forecasting: Predicting cloudbursts remains difficult, particularly in hilly regions where the interaction between moisture and terrain is complex.

PUMPED STORAGE HYDROPOWER
Budget 2024-25 promised that a policy for promoting pumped storage projects will be brought out for electricity storage and facilitating smooth integration of the growing share of renewable energy with its variable and intermittent nature.
As the world focused on renewable energy and the challenge of variable power generation, many solutions for energy storage were proposed. The most widely adopted method globally is pumped storage.These are like super large batteries but natural and use water.
About Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) :
Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) is a type of hydroelectric energy storage that plays a crucial role in balancing electricity supply and demand.
How It Works
PSH involves two water reservoirs at different elevations:
Upper Reservoir: Positioned at a higher elevation.
Lower Reservoir: Positioned at a lower elevation.
During periods of low electricity demand, excess energy from the grid is used to pump water from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir. This process stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. When electricity demand is high, the stored water is released back into the lower reservoir through turbines, generating electricity in the process.
Types of PSH
Open-Loop PSH: This system has a continuous connection to a natural water source, such as a river.
Closed-Loop PSH: This system operates independently of natural water bodies, using only the two reservoirs.
Advantages
Energy Storage: PSH acts like a giant battery, storing energy for later use.
Grid Stability: It helps balance supply and demand, ensuring a stable electricity grid.
Renewable Integration: PSH supports the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar by storing excess energy.
s experience
India has 3.3 GW of pumped storage. Main ones are Nagarjunasagar, Kadana, Kadamparai, Panchet and Bhira. Some four are under construction and two in advanced levels of planning.
How the Kadamparai Plant Operates :
In Tamil Nadu, wind and solar power can generate half of the state’s electricity at noon, particularly in July. On a typical summer day, solar plants generate around 5,000 MW at noon, but this drops to zero by sunset. Wind power varies seasonally, with its peak from May to September.
Tamil Nadu has peaks of around 17,000 MW to 20,000 MW on a daily basis. This year in July, maximum wind power generated reached 5,499 MW and maximum solar reached 5,512 MW. Wind and solar have Must Run Status in the State which means whatever they produce must be taken.
The Kadamparai plant in Tamil Nadu helps balance the grid. It features an upper and lower reservoir, with a height difference of around 380 meters. The plant’s turbine generator can produce electricity when water flows from the upper to the lower reservoir and can also function as a pump, consuming electricity to move water back up.
Power managers in Tamil Nadu plan daily operations based on expected demand and weather forecasts. Excess solar power during the day is used to pump water to the upper reservoir at Kadamparai. When solar power generation ceases in the evening, the Kadamparai plant switches to generating mode, providing 400 MW of power for three to four hours to support evening peak loads.
The upper reservoir holds around 1 TMC feet of water, with minimal leakage, often replenished by rainfall. During peak solar generation, hydro power (approximately 1,000 MW) is conserved for peak demand times or emergencies. Hydro power can be quickly activated if there’s a sudden drop in other power sources.

**********Before the Landslide: Wayanad Tragedy is a Warning, Do Not Ignore Ecology
Context
In recent days,
Wayanad, a district known for its breathtaking landscapes, has been hit by a catastrophic landslide
that has resulted in profound loss and devastation.
The landslide,
triggered by a cloudburst, ravaged the regions of Meppadi, Mundakkai, and Chooralmala leading to the collapse of a crucial bridge in Mundakkai
and resulting in the death of over 300 people, with an equal number still missing.
This
tragedy underscores the severe consequences of both natural and human-induced factors
on fragile ecosystems.
Environmental and Climatic Factors Behind Wayanad Landslide
According to climate experts,
the immediate cause of the landslide was the exceptionally heavy rainfall
linked to the warming of the Arabian Sea.
phenomenon has caused atmospheric instability over large parts of the Western Ghats,
including Kerala, resulting in rain-laden clouds moving southward and causing excessive rainfall.
The warming of the Arabian Sea, indicative of broader climate change patterns, has intensified weather anomalies,
making regions like Wayanad increasingly vulnerable to such disasters.
Human Induced Factors Behind Wayanad Tragedy
Unchecked Development and Tourism
Wayanad's scenic beauty has made it a popular eco-tourism destination,
attracting numerous tourists annually.
To cater to this influx,
there has been rampant construction of resorts, hotels, and other infrastructure.
This development, however, has often been carried out without proper environmental assessments
or adherence to sustainable practices.
Resorts have sprung up in fragile areas
, roads have been carved into steep hillsides, and tunnels have been bored through mountains,
all contributing to the destabilisation of the terrain.
Quarrying Activities
demand for construction materials has led to extensive quarrying in the Western Ghats
, including Wayanad.
Quarrying involves the removal of large amounts of rock and soil, which not only alters the landscape
but also affects the structural integrity of the land.
removal of vegetation and topsoil increases the risk of soil erosion
and reduces the land's ability to absorb and retain water.
During heavy rains, these areas become prone to landslides
as the destabilized ground cannot withstand the increased water pressure.
Inadequate Land Use Planning
Construction and development projects
have often been executed
without considering the region’s carrying capacity
and ecological sensitivity.
Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, led by Madhav Gadgil, had demarcated the region as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA)
and recommended restrictions on construction, mining, and quarrying.
However,
these guidelines were not adequately implemented,
and development continued unchecked, ignoring the potential environmental impact.
Deforestation and Plantation Expansion
study from 2022 revealed that 62% of the district’s green cover disappeared between 1950 and 2018
, while plantation cover increased by around 1,800%.
dense forests, which once provided stability to the soil and regulated water flow, have been replaced by plantations
, particularly rubber.
Rubber trees, unlike the native forest vegetation, have shallow root systems
that are less effective in preventing soil erosion.
change in land cover has reduced the soil's ability to retain water,
increasing the likelihood of landslides during heavy rainfall.
Outdated Infrastructure and Practices
Infrastructure development in Wayanad and other parts of Kerala
relied on outdated data and practices
that do not account for current rainfall patterns and intensities.
construction of roads, bridges, and culverts has not been designed to handle the increased water flow
during heavy rains, leading to blockages and flooding.
These
inadequacies in infrastructure design and maintenance have contributed to the severity of the landslides
and the resulting destruction.
Ignoring Expert Warnings
Despite repeated warnings from climate experts
and environmentalists, the
recommendations to curb construction and implement sustainable practices have been largely ignored.
2011 Gadgil Committee report highlighted the need for stringent measures to protect the Western Ghats
, but the continued neglect and prioritisation of economic gains over environmental sustainability have led to repeated disasters.
The failure to heed these warnings has resulted in significant loss of life and property
and has further degraded the region's ecological balance.
Broader Implications for Kerala
Recurring Climate-Induced Disasters
Kerala has experienced a series of devastating climate-induced disasters
over the past decade.
2018 floods, which killed more than 400 people
and caused widespread destruction, were followed by similar events in subsequent years.
In 2019 and 2020, landslides in Idukki district claimed many lives
, including numerous tea plantation workers.
cycle continued in 2021 and 2022, with landslides and flash floods striking again.
recurring disasters indicate that Kerala is increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events,
exacerbated by climate change.
Impact on Biodiversity and Ecosystems
The environmental degradation in Kerala has severe implications for biodiversity and ecosystems.
Western Ghats are home to numerous endemic species of flora and fauna.
destruction of forests and natural habitats
due to unplanned development and plantation agriculture
threatens these species' survival.
loss of biodiversity not only impacts the ecological balance but also affects the livelihoods of communities
dependent on these natural resources.
Socio-Economic Consequences
recurring natural disasters have significant socio-economic consequences for Kerala.
destruction of homes, infrastructure, and agricultural land leads to massive financial losses
and displaces thousands of people.
tourism industry, a major contributor to the state’s economy, also suffers as natural beauty spots become disaster-prone
Additionally, the cost of disaster relief and rehabilitation strains the state’s resources, diverting funds from other essential services.
Way Forward
Need for Climate-Resilient Infrastructure
To mitigate the impact of climate-induced disasters,
Kerala must invest in climate-resilient infrastructure.
includes constructing roads, bridges, and buildings designed to withstand extreme weather conditions.
Incorporating scientific precision and environmental considerations
into development projects is essential.
Such infrastructure should accommodate current and future rainfall patterns
, ensuring that drainage systems can handle heavy downpours without causing blockages or floods.
Sustainable Land Management Practices
Promoting sustainable land management practices
is crucial to maintaining hillside stability and reducing soil erosion.
Reforestation, controlled deforestation, and sustainable agriculture can help
restore the ecological balance in the Western Ghats.
Planting native tree species and maintaining natural vegetation cover can enhance the soil’s ability
to retain water and prevent landslides.
Sustainable agricultural practices can minimise land degradation and ensure long-term productivity without compromising the environment
Conclusion
The recent tragedy in Wayanad is a stark reminder of the fragile balance
between nature and human activity.
To prevent future tragedies,
it is imperative to integrate scientific precision in development activities,
respect ecological warnings, and prioritize sustainable land management practices.
Only through such measures can we hope to safeguard our environment
and the lives that depend on it.

Editorial Analysis
**********Legal challenges to the Great Nicobar infrastructure project
Why in news?
The Central government's Rs 72,000 crore Great Nicobar Island (GNI) infrastructure project includes constructing an airport for civilian and defense use, an international container transshipment terminal, and a township.
The project has faced legal challenges in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Calcutta High Court.
Recently, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation Limited (ANIIDCO), the project's implementing agency, submitted conclusions from a high-powered committee (HPC) formed by NGT in 2023.
The HPC concluded that the proposed transshipment port does not fall within the Island Coastal Regulation Zone-IA (ICRZ-IA), where ports are prohibited.
What’s in today’s article?
Great Nicobar Island – location, ecosystem, tribes
Great Nicobar Island (GNI) Project
Legal Challenges to the GNI Project
Geographical location
Great Nicobar, the southernmost of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a cluster of about 836 islands in the eastern Bay of Bengal.
The two groups of which are separated by the 150-km wide
Ten Degree Channel
The Andaman Islands lie to the north of the channel, and the Nicobar Islands to the south.
Indira Point on the southern tip of Great Nicobar Island is India’s southernmost point, less than 150 km from the northernmost island of the Indonesian archipelago.
Ecosystem
The Great Nicobar Island has tropical wet evergreen forests, mountain ranges reaching almost 650 m above sea level, and coastal plains.
The Island has two national parks and a biosphere reserve.
Many endangered species are found at the Island. The
leatherback sea turtle is the island’s flagship species
Tribes of Nicobar
Great Nicobar is home to
the Shompen and Nicobarese tribal peoples
The Shompen are hunter-gatherers who depend on forest and marine resources for sustenance.
The Nicobarese, who lived along the west coast of the island were mostly relocated after the 2004 tsunami.
An estimated 237 Shompen and 1,094 Nicobarese individuals now live in a 751 sq km tribal reserve, some 84 sq km of which is proposed to be denotified.
Great Nicobar Island project
In November 2022, the Environment ministry has given environmental clearance for the Centre’s ambitious Rs 72,000 crore multi-development projects in Greater Nicobar Island.
The Great Nicobar Island (GNI) is a mega project to be implemented at the southern end of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
The project includes an international container trans-shipment terminal, an international airport, township development, and a 450 MVA gas and solar based power plant over an extent of 16,610 hectares in the island.
The port will be controlled by the Indian Navy, while the airport will have dual military-civilian functions and will cater to tourism as well.
Legal Challenges and Grounds for Appeals
In 2022, environmental activists challenged the environmental and Coastal Regulation Zone clearances granted to the project.
They cited irreversible damage to biodiversity, inadequate environmental impact studies, and opacity in the clearance process.
They highlighted the impact on the Shompen and Nicobarese tribal communities and the ecological sensitivity of the Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ-IA).
NGT's Response and Formation of HPC
The NGT formed a high-powered committee (HPC) to revisit the project’s green clearance due to concerns about coral conservation, the port’s location in a prohibited area, and limited baseline data.
The HPC concluded that the proposed port does not fall in the ICRZ-IA
Recent petitions
In May 2024, Kothari filed two petitions before the NGT’s eastern bench.
The first challenged the exclusion of parts of the project from ecologically sensitive areas as per the 2019 CRZ notification.
The second accused the MoEFCC of contempt for not updating the NGT on the HPC’s findings and failing to act as directed.
ANIIDCO filed a counter affidavit, while MoEFCC requested more time to respond.
High Court Cases
The activists also filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court challenging the NGT’s April 2023 order.
The petition argued that the NGT special bench overstepped its jurisdiction and failed to adequately consider the project’s environmental impact, delegating decision-making to the HPC.
It contended that the NGT should have directly evaluated the clearances and not relied on the committee.

**********Olympics boxing gender testing controversy
Why in news?
Imane Khelif, a 25-year-old welterweight from Algeria, qualified for the quarterfinals of the Olympic women's boxing tournament by dismantling Italy's Angela Carini in the round of 16. Their fight lasted just 46 seconds.
Since her victory, Khelif has been the target of a wave of abuse, with many calling her a “biological man” who had an “unfair advantage” over Carini. Some people also wrongly identified Khelif as a transgender woman.
The participation of trans women, and women having certain “masculine” biological characteristics like higher testosterone levels, in women’s sports has long been a subject of polarising debate.
What’s in today’s article?
Background: the controversy
Gender eligibility: a contentious issue in women’s sports
Steps taken by sports federations deal with this matter
Boxers failed gender eligibility test conducted by International Boxing Association (IBA)
In 2023, Imane Khelif and Chinese Taipei boxer Lin Yu-ting were banned from competing in the IBA’s World Championship in New Delhi after failing a confidential "gender eligibility" test.
The IBA stated that the boxers did not meet the criteria to compete in the female category.
Both boxers are competing in Paris Olympics
Both boxers are now competing at the Paris Olympics, as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) derecognized the IBA over governance and financial issues.
The IOC-appointed unit governing the competition in Paris only requires the gender stated in an athlete’s passport for eligibility, and Khelif’s passport identifies her as female.
Response by IOC
Following Khelif’s win and the subsequent abuse, the IOC stated that all Olympic boxers complied with eligibility and entry regulations.
It noted that both Khelif and Lin have competed in women’s competitions for many years, including the Tokyo 2020 Games.
The IOC also criticized the IBA's decision to ban the two women as arbitrary and not following proper procedure.
Organization of sports based on sex
Modern sports are organized on the basis of sex, with men and women competing in different categories.
This is because men, on average, have certain physiological advantages over women.
Sex is determined based on chromosomes
Sex is determined based on chromosomes, which carry genes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes — 22 are identical in men and women; one, the sex chromosome, is different.
The XX sex chromosomes result in the development of female sex organs, and XY in male sex organs.
The SRY gene, found on the Y chromosome, is responsible for the production of testosterone
Link between testosterone and athletic performance
Many studies have supported the link between testosterone and athletic performance.
As per them, the difference in circulating testosterone between adults likely explains most, if not all, sex differences in sporting performance due to testosterone's effects on muscle mass, strength, bone size, strength (density), and circulating hemoglobin.
However, other studies note that data on this matter is currently inadequate.
DSD and Swyer syndrome
Some people born with female reproductive organs may also carry the XY chromosome, in what is known as Swyer syndrome.
This syndrome is one of many “Disorders of Sex Development”, or DSDs.
Swyer syndrome, also known as 46 XY gonadal dysgenesis, is a rare genetic condition where individuals have one X and one Y chromosome in each cell (typically associated with males) but develop female reproductive structures.
People with Swyer syndrome are genetically male but phenotypically female, meaning they have a female appearance and female external genitalia.
This is at the heart of the debate surrounding gender eligibility in women’s sports.
Many argue that in order to prevent some athletes from having an unfair advantage in women’s sports, women with DSDs must not be allowed to compete with other women.
They claim that DSDs facilitate greater testosterone production, and other consequent athletic advantages.
Sports federations have their own eligibility criteria
In 2021, the IOC decided to allow international sports federations to develop their own eligibility rules based on an “evidence-based approach” considering principles of “fairness”, “inclusion”, “non-discrimination”, “no presumption of advantage”, and “prevention of harm.”
Previously, the IOC required women athletes who had transitioned from male to female to have testosterone levels below 10 nanomoles per litre (nmol/L).
World Athletics still uses testosterone levels as an eligibility criterion, requiring DSD athletes to maintain levels below 2.5 nmol/L for at least 24 months before competing.
This is stricter than the pre-2023 requirement of 5 nmol/L for events ranging from 400 meters to a mile, with no restrictions on other events.
FINA, the world swimming body, the International Cycling Union, and the International Rugby Union have all implemented varying degrees of bans on trans women athletes.
Debate goes on
There is still much unknown about the impact of testosterone on sporting performance.
Many question whether women born with higher levels of testosterone have any different advantage compared to people with other genetic advantages, such as LeBron James' height or Michael Phelps' large, fin-like hands.

**********Conservation and Protection of Western Ghats
Why in News?
The Union Environment Ministry (MoEFCC) has issued a draft notification to declare the Western Ghats an ecologically sensitive area (ESA). The ESA includes villages in Wayanad (Kerala), where a devastating series of landslides on July 30 killed at least 210 people, with hundreds more still missing.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Western Ghats and its Conservation Efforts
The Sixth Draft Western Ghats Notification
Challenges Towards Conserving Western Ghats
About Western Ghats:
It is a mountain range
(in a stretch of 1,600 Km) parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula.
It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site
and is one of the 36 biodiversity hotspots in the world.
These are home to high mountain forests
, which have been
severely fragmented
due to human activities, especially clear-felling for tea, coffee, and teak plantations.
Conservation efforts:
In 2010
, MoEFCC appointed the
Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP)
, to be chaired by ecologist
Dr Madhav Gadgil
It was formed
to study the impact of population pressure, climate change and development activities
on the Western Ghats.
Recommendations of the WGEEP:
Designate the entire region as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA)
and classify 64% of the Western Ghats into Ecologically Sensitive Zones called ESZ 1, ESZ 2 and ESZ 3.
Almost all developmental activities
like mining, construction of thermal power plants, and dams were to stop along with the
decommissioning of similar projects
that have completed their shelf life in ESZ 1.
The report suggested
a bottom-to-top approach
and the establishment of a
Western Ghats Ecology Authority
to manage the ecology of the region and to ensure its sustainable development.
Resistance to the implementation of the WGEEP’s recommendations:
Stakeholder states resisted
the Gadgil panel recommendations amid fears of hindrance to development and loss of livelihood.
In 2012
, MoEFCC constituted a
High-Level Working Group on Western Ghats
under former ISRO chief
Dr K Kasturirangan,
to formulate a report to replace WGEEP.
Recommendations of the Kasturirangan-led panel:
It notified only 37%
(against 64% by Gadgil commission) of the area as ecologically sensitive.
It also split the Western Ghats into
cultural (human settlements) and natural (non-human settlements) regions. It was suggested that
cultural lands be designated as an ESA.
Status of implementation of above recommendations:
In 2017
, MoEFCC demarcated an area of 56,825 sq Km in the Western Ghats as ESA as opposed to the 59,940 sq Km recommended by the Kasturirangan committee.
Kerala has 9,993 sq km;
Karnataka 20,668 sq km, Tamil Nadu 6,914 sq km; Maharashtra 17,340 sq km; Goa 1,461 sq km and Gujarat 449 sq km.
The Sixth Draft Western Ghats Notification:
Background:
The latest draft notification
has been reissued because the previous draft (issued in July 2022) expired, and may have been prompted by recent
devastating landslides in Wayanad district
This comes 13 years after
the first such demarcation was recommended by a panel led by eminent ecologist Madhav Gadgil in 2011.
Since then, the proposed protected area has
shrunk from the original 75% recommendation to the current 37%.
About the draft notification:
The proposal for the ESA classification
covers six states
and 59,940 square kilometres of the Western Ghats or
roughly 37% of the range.
It states that
All new and expansion projects of building and construction with built-up area of 20,000 square metres and above, and
All new and expansion townships and area development projects with an area of 50 hectares and above or with built-up area of 150,000 square metres and above
shall be prohibited
Impact of the latest draft:
If finalised,
the notification would impose a complete ban
on mining, quarrying, sand mining, thermal power plants, and polluting industries in the designated areas.
It would also prohibit
new construction projects and township developments above certain thresholds.
Additionally,
hydropower projects and less polluting industries would be regulated
, and a monitoring mechanism would be established.
Challenges Towards Conserving Western Ghats:
The outcome of this long-standing environmental protection effort
remains uncertain
conservation needs clashing with the developmental aspirations
in one of India’s most ecologically significant regions.
As the draft notification now stands,
it is up to the Western Ghats state governments to accept or reject the proposal
Despite its six iterations,
the draft notification is yet to become law
, as all six affected States have objected to specific places that have been included in the ESA regions.
The dominant sentiment in Kerala
was that this notification would subsume agricultural plantations, curtail the State’s hydro-electricity plans, and would lead to a migration crisis given the State’s high population density.
To address states’ concerns, MoEFCC constituted a high-level committee in 2022 to balance
Conservation aspects of the disaster-prone pristine ecosystem, and
The rights, privileges, needs and developmental aspirations of the region.
But is yet to submit its report.

**********An unstated shift in Modi’s economic direction             
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About Employment Linked Incentives (ELI)
Why in the news?
The introduction of the new
ELI scheme for corporates
by the Narendra Modi government acknowledges the disconnect between GDP growth and job creation.
The ELI scheme
aims to encourage companies to hire more employees by providing financial incentives for each new hire.
Target Sectors: The scheme is expected to focus on labour-intensive sectors such as
toys, textiles, apparel, furniture, tourism, and logistics,
which have significant potential for job creation.
Incentives Offered: Financial incentives may include
tax relief and wage subsidies for new jobs created
, along with non-financial incentives like reduced regulatory burdens and support for skill development programs.
Government’s Failure of Initiatives
Previous Economic Strategies:
Over the past decade, the Indian government relied on traditional economic models, such as the
trickle-down approach and production-linked incentives (PLI),
which did not yield the expected job growth.
Initiatives like
“Make in India”
corporate tax cuts
aimed to stimulate investment but
failed to translate into significant employment opportunities.
Jobless Growth:
Despite policies designed to boost production, employment growth has been stagnant, with a study indicating a
negligible employment growth rate of just 0.01%.
Issue of Job and Ideas Deficit
Jobs Deficit:
The lack of job creation has prompted proposals like reserving jobs for locals, reflecting political pressures in a democracy where job scarcity is prevalent.
Ideas Deficit:
Economists often suggest reforms in labour, education, and business practices as solutions to job creation, but these are complex and difficult to implement.
Unemployment Trends:
The unemployment rate has shown fluctuations, with a reported decline from
6.0% in 2017-18 to 3.2% in 2022-23.
What can be done?
Policy Shift:
The ELI scheme represents a significant policy shift towards prioritizing job creation over mere economic output. By encouraging firms to hire rather than invest solely in automation, it aims to address the capital-labour imbalance in the economy.
Support for MSMEs:
Special focus on
micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)
is crucial, as they employ a substantial portion of the workforce.
Alignment of Goals:
Need to Collaborate among various ministries, particularly finance, skill development, and labour, is essential to ensure that skill development aligns with industry needs, enhancing employability and job creation
**********Why the Odisha government will plant palm trees to combat lightning strikes          
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Lightning strikes in India
Mains level:
NDMA Guidelines for Lightning
Why in the news?
In July, the Odisha government approved a proposal to plant 1.9 million palm trees to mitigate deaths caused by lightning strikes, which were declared a state-specific disaster in 2015.
How many people have lost their lives to lightning in Odisha?
Over the
last 11 years, a total of 3,790 people
have lost their lives due to lightning strikes in Odisha.
In the previous three fiscal years, 791 fatalities were reported, indicating an increasing frequency of lightning strikes.
On September 2, 2023, Odisha
recorded 61,000 lightning strikes in a two-hour period,
resulting in the
deaths of at least 12 people.
Why are Lightning strikes of particular concern in Odisha?
Odisha is located in a
tropical zone
and e
xperiences a hot, dry climate that creates ideal conditions for lightning strikes.
The state has the highest number of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes in eastern and central India. The
Annual Lightning Report 2023-2024
indicates a significant concentration of lightning activity in this region.
Research indicates that climate change exacerbates lightning activity, with a 10% increase in lightning occurrences for every degree Celsius of warming. This is particularly relevant in Odisha, where climatic factors contribute to frequent lightning events.
With
96% of lightning strikes occurring in rural areas,
the most affected populations include farmers and daily wage earners who work outdoors, making them particularly vulnerable during peak agricultural seasons.
How can Odisha defend Itself against lightning strikes?
Planting Palm Trees:
The Odisha government has approved a proposal to plant 19 lakh palm trees as a natural defense against lightning strikes. Palm trees are considered
effective conductors of lightning due to their height and moisture content, which can absorb lightning and mitigate its impact on the ground.
Financial Commitment:
The state has allocated
Rs 7 crore for the palm tree plantation initiative
and has banned the felling of existing palm trees to enhance this strategy.
Public Awareness and Early Warning Systems:
While the state has implemented
early warning systems to forecast lightning strikes,
experts emphasize the need for widespread public education on safety measures during lightning events.
Concerns:
Experts have raised concerns about the effectiveness of palm trees as a long-term solution, noting that
it takes 15 to 20 years for them to reach a height where they can effectively mitigate lightning strikes.
Preparation and Awareness:
The Local government should educate the communities about lightning safety and the risks associated with thunderstorms.
Seek Shelter:
During a thunderstorm, individuals should seek shelter in a fully enclosed building or a hard-topped metal vehicle. Open vehicles and structures such as metal sheds or under-construction buildings are unsafe.
Avoid Trees:
Taking shelter under trees is discouraged, as they can attract lightning. If in a wooded area, find the shortest trees for shelter.
Crouching Position:
If no shelter is available, crouch down with heels touching and head between the knees to minimize height and reduce risk.
30-30 Rule:
After seeing lightning, start counting to 30. If you hear thunder before reaching 30, go indoors. This rule helps assess the distance of the storm.
Way forward:
Installation of Lightning Rods and Conductors:
The government should invest in the widespread installation of lightning rods and conductors in rural and vulnerable areas. These devices can provide immediate protection to critical infrastructure, homes, and open fields where farmers and workers are most at risk.
Advanced Early Warning Systems:
Need to enhance the existing early warning systems with more accurate, real-time data and ensure these warnings are disseminated quickly through multiple channels, including mobile alerts, community announcements, and local radio.
Main PYQ:
Explain the mechanism and occurrence of cloudburst in the context of the Indian subcontinent. Discuss two recent examples.

**********Elephant in Civil Servant’s room           
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
The idea of Constitutional Democracy
Why in the news?
The government’s recent decision to lift the ban on government employees participating in RSS activities threatens to undermine the remnants of a free and fair bureaucracy.
Whether or not civil servants are banned from joining RSS
Lifting the Ban:
The Central government has lifted a 58-year ban on government servants joining the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). This ban was originally imposed in 1966 due to concerns about the organization’s political activities.
Government Justification:
The government stated that the activities of the RSS are no longer deemed incompatible with civil service conduct rules, suggesting that the organization has been wrongly categorized as a banned entity.
Judicial Commentary:
The Madhya Pradesh High Court remarked that it took nearly five decades for the government to recognize its mistake in banning civil servants from joining the RSS, indicating a shift in perception regarding the organization.
Political Reactions:
The decision has sparked controversy, with opposition parties criticizing it as a threat to India’s secular fabric and accusing the government of politicizing the civil service. Critics argue that the RSS’s ideology conflicts with the principles of a secular state.
Support from RSS:
The RSS welcomed the decision, asserting that it strengthens India’s democratic system and has historically contributed to national unity and social service.
Constitutional democracy is a system of government
that combines the principles of democracy with a constitution that limits the powers of the state and protects the rights of citizens.
people are the ultimate source of power,
and the government derives its authority from their consent. The constitution places restrictions on the government’s actions and establishes the structure of the government.
There is a
separation of powers between the legislature, executive, and judiciary,
with each acting as a check on the others. The rule of law applies equally to all citizens and the government itself.
Minority rights are protected, and the will of the majority is balanced against the rights of individuals and minority groups.
Constitutional democracy guarantees some rights to everyone, irrespective of their status as a minority or majority.
origins of constitutional democracy
can be traced back to Enlightenment ideas of natural rights, social contract theory, and the separation of powers. The United States Constitution, adopted in 1787, was a pioneering example of a written constitution establishing a federal system of government with a separation of powers
RSS Ideology vs Constitutional Democracy
Conflict of Ideologies:
The lifting of the ban raises questions about the relationship between the RSS’s ideology and the constitutional framework of India. The RSS promotes a vision of a Hindu nation, which may conflict with the secular and pluralistic ideals enshrined in the Constitution.
Constitutional Morality:
The Constitution aims to create a society that respects diverse religions and cultures, contrasting with the RSS’s focus on a singular religious identity. This juxtaposition presents challenges to the commitment of civil servants to uphold constitutional values.
Historical background of the Constitution:
The Constitution was designed to restructure Indian society post-independence, ensuring inclusivity and rejecting the idea of a state aligned with a single religious community. The RSS’s ideology, which criticizes the post-1947 restructuring, poses a fundamental challenge to this vision.
Democratic Challenges:
The existence of non-democratic and exclusionary ideas within a democratic framework complicates governance. The rise of Hindutva politics, which emphasizes majoritarianism and exclusion, threatens the principles of constitutional democracy.
Need for Reinforcement:
To counter the influence of ideologies that contradict constitutional morality, there is a pressing need to reinvigorate the commitment to constitutional democracy among civil servants and the broader public.
Conclusion:
To uphold constitutional democracy, it is crucial to reinforce the commitment to secularism, inclusivity, and the rule of law among civil servants and the broader public amidst ideological challenges.
Mains PYQ:
To enhance the quality of democracy in India the Election Commission of India has proposed electoral reforms in 2016. What are the suggested reforms and how far are they significant to make democracy successful?

**********Centre reissues draft notification on ecosensitive areas in Western Ghats          
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs)
Mains level:
Reason behind the designation of Western Ghat as an ESA
Why in the news?
On Friday, the Central government released the sixth draft notification, designating 56,825.7 square kilometre of the Western Ghats as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA) across the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.
Recommendations of the Gadgil and Kasturirangan Committees
Gadgil Committee:
Recommended that 75% of the Western Ghats (129,037 sq km) be designated as ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs) with restrictions on development activities.
Kasturirangan Committee:
Notified only 37% of the Western Ghats as ESAs, reducing the extent compared to the Gadgil report. It split the region into cultural (human settlements) and natural (non-human settlements) zones.
ESAs are regions recognized for their
environmental significance, where human activities are regulated to protect biodiversity, ecosystems, and natural habitats.
These areas are often
home to endemic species of plants and animals
and are crucial for maintaining ecological balance.
The Environment (Protection) Act of 1986
allows the
Central Government to restrict industrial activities in these sensitive areas to safeguard their ecological integrity.
Although the term “Eco-Sensitive Zones” is not explicitly mentioned in the Act, provisions exist to prohibit or regulate activities based on biodiversity and environmental considerations.
The reason behind it:
Biodiversity Hotspot:
The Western Ghats is recognized as one of the
world’s eight “hottest hotspots” of biological diversity and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
It is home to numerous endemic species and globally threatened flora and fauna, making its protection crucial for conserving biodiversity.
Recent Natural Disasters:
The draft notification follows severe
landslides in Wayanad, Kerala,
which resulted in significant loss of life and property. These events underscored the
vulnerability of the region to ecological disasters
, highlighting the need for protective measures to prevent further environmental degradation
Opposition from States
State governments, including Kerala, have opposed the proposals in the draft notifications for declaring ESAs along the Western Ghats.
The Kerala government want to reduce the ESA to 9,993.7 sq km from the Kasturirangan committee’s recommendation of 13,108 sq km.
The then Kerala government led by Oommen Chandy opposed the Gadgil report and appointed another panel to come up with an independent report.
New Panel Formed by the Government
In April 2022, the Centre formed another panel to
“re-examine suggestions by these six state governments
while keeping in view the conservation aspects of the disaster-prone pristine ecosystem, as well as rights, privileges, needs and developmental aspirations of the region”.
The Centre and expert panel held 10 meetings with states having Western Ghats to discuss the fifth draft notification at various forums.
The sixth draft notification, issued on Friday,
declared 56,825.7 sq km of the Western Ghats as ESAs in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu
Way forward:
Integrated Management Plans:
The Government should develop and implement integrated management plans that balance ecological conservation with the developmental needs of the region.
Enhanced Monitoring and Enforcement:
There is a need to strengthen the regulatory framework by enhancing monitoring mechanisms and enforcing existing environmental laws more stringently.
Mains PYQ:
Differentiate the causes of landslides in the Himalayan region and Western Ghats.
