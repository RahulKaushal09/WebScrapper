The Hidden Cost of Greenwashing the Indian Railways
Context
The Indian Railways
, in pursuit of its ambitious Mission 100% Electrification,
aims to modernise the country’s vast rail network by completely phasing out diesel traction.
While the vision is positioned as a step towards reducing foreign exchange expenditure,
environmental pollution, and transitioning to renewable energy,
the practical outcomes of this mission raise significant concerns.
Now it becomes imperative to explore the government’s push for hundred percent rail electrification, its implications,
and the way forward to a sustainable solution.
Government’s Decision of Repurposing of Diesel Locomotives and Implications of this Policy Shifts
Engineering Feat of Locomotive Conversion
The Indian Railways' decision to export used diesel locomotives after converting them for Cape Gauge usage
reflects an impressive feat of engineering and innovation.
conversion process involves significant technical challenges
, including modifying locomotives originally designed for the 1,676 mm broad gauge to a much narrower 1,067 mm gauge.
This
requires meticulous re-engineering, essentially dismantling and rebuilding the locomotives
to suit operational requirements in African countries.
While this showcases the skill and expertise of Indian engineers
and institutions like RITES Ltd.,
the underlying reason for such exports lies in the sweeping electrification policy
that has rendered these locomotives redundant.
Premature Redundancy of Diesel Locomotives
The policy shift towards 100% electrification, pursued in mission mode, is
rooted in the government’s desire to modernise rail infrastructure,
reduce dependency on imported diesel, and promote environmental sustainability.
However, this shift has come at the cost of prematurely retiring diesel locomotives,
many of which remain in good working condition with substantial residual service life.
According to RTI data, as of March 2023, there were 585 diesel locomotives stabled, idling across the network
due to the rapid expansion of electrification.
This figure has reportedly risen to 760 in 2024
, with over 60% of these locomotives possessing more than 15 years of remaining service life.
Thus, valuable assets that could have continued to generate returns are instead being phased out or sent for export
, leading to significant financial losses and resource wastage.
The Environmental Paradox of Electrification
Furthermore,
the export of these locomotives highlights the paradoxical outcomes of the electrification policy.
On the one hand,
Indian Railways is eliminating domestic diesel traction in favour of electrification, presenting it as a green initiative.
On the other hand, t
he same locomotives, now deemed obsolete domestically, are being exported to other countries
where they will continue to operate, albeit in a modified form.
export does not eliminate the environmental impact of diesel locomotives;
it merely transfers it to other regions.
Overlooking Diesel Locomotives’ Strategic Value
Additionally,
the rapid electrification drive has forced Indian Railways to overlook the versatility and utility of diesel locomotives.
Unlike electric locomotives,
diesel locomotives are self-sufficient and do not rely on overhead electric wires
, making them highly valuable in situations where infrastructure is inadequate or power supply is inconsistent.
This adaptability is especially critical during natural disasters, power outages,
or in remote areas where electrification is not yet viable.
By aggressively sidelining diesel traction, Indian Railways risks compromising its operational flexibility
and preparedness for emergencies.
Missed Opportunities for Redeployment
The decision to export these locomotives
also indicates a missed opportunity for redeployment within India.
Many smaller or regional routes, where traffic density is lower and full-scale electrification may not be economically justified
, could continue to
benefit from diesel traction.
Instead of strategically using these locomotives
to optimise network performance,
Indian Railways has prioritised electrification as a blanket solution,
rendering such redeployment unlikely.
A Closer Scrutiny of Government’s Reasons for Rail Electrification
Economic Viability of Electrification
government justifies rail electrification on two primary grounds
:
reducing foreign exchange by cutting diesel imports and promoting environmental sustainability
, however, these claims require closer scrutiny.
First,
railway diesel consumption constitutes an insignificant share of India’s total diesel use.
According to a 2014 study by AC Nielsen,
the transport sector accounted for 70% of diesel consumption,
the railways contributed only 3.24%.
By 2021-22, this share had further reduced to around 2%.
n contrast, trucks alone consumed 28% of the diesel supply, with agriculture accounting for 13.2%.
Thus, eliminating diesel traction in railways will achieve negligible reductions
in national diesel consumption while ignoring larger sectors.
Second, the economic argument fails to account for the costs
associated with premature electrification.
substantial capital investment in building electric traction infrastructure
and retiring usable diesel locomotives creates financial inefficiencies
Environmental Considerations: A Misleading Justification
environmental justification
for rail electrification
appears equally tenuous.
While e
lectrification reduces local emissions from diesel combustion, it does not address the source of the electricity itself.
India’s electricity generation is still heavily dependent on coal,
which accounts for nearly 50% of the total energy mix.
Indian Railways plays a crucial role in transporting coal to thermal plants,
with 40% of its freight earnings generated by this activity alone.
Replacing diesel locomotives with electric ones shifts pollution from railway tracks to coal-fired power plants.
Electric locomotives, powered by coal-based electricity, perpetuate a carbon-intensive cycle:
more coal transported to generate electricity, which then powers the locomotives.
Until India achieves a cleaner energy mix,
where 80% of power is derived from non-fossil fuels,
the claim of achieving a Green Railway remains unrealistic.
The environmental benefits of electrification, therefore, are a superficial narrative that ignores systemic dependencies on coal.
Policy Implications of Push for 100% Rail Electrification
The aggressive push for rail electrification epitomises the risks of policy-making driven by headline-grabbing slogans
rather than pragmatic planning.
sheer scale of wastage, locomotives stretching over 16 kms
if lined end-to-end
reflects inefficient use of public resources.
Costly,
functional assets are discarded in favour of an unbalanced modernisation agenda,
ultimately burdening taxpayers.
Moreover,
the policy undermines the Railways’ role as a lifeline for India’s economy.
Way Forward: A Balanced Approach
Instead of carefully balancing electrification with existing diesel assets,
the government has pursued a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding regional and operational requirements.
The resulting dichotomy, retaining diesel locomotives while claiming a green transition, demonstrates a lack of coherence in execution.
A more balanced approach would involve
phased electrification, improved asset management, and investments in cleaner energy generation.
For the Railways to become genuinely green,
systemic changes are needed beyond electrification, changes that address the foundational issues
of energy production, resource utilisation, and operational sustainability.
Conclusion
The Indian Railways’ Mission 100% Electrification is a case study of overzealous policy-making
driven by ambitious, but impractical goals.
While reducing diesel imports and emissions are commendable objectives,
the realities of India’s energy mix and the marginal contribution of railways to diesel consumption undermine the rationale.
The policy’s environmental claims are premature, and its economic implications are wasteful,
as functional diesel assets are abandoned without a clear strategy for their use.

**********India’s First Diabetes Biobank
India has established its first diabetes biobank at the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF) in Chennai, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).
Key Features of the Biobank
The diabetes biobank is a
repository of biological samples
collected from different populations to aid scientific research. It is designed to:
Collect, process, store and distribute biospecimens
to support ongoing and future studies.
House blood samples for various forms of diabetes, including
Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes.
About Diabetes:
chronic disease
that occurs when the
pancreas
is unable to produce insulin or when the body cannot use insulin effectively.
Insulin
is a hormone that helps regulate
blood glucose levels
If the body fails to produce or use insulin properly, it results in
high blood glucose levels
, a condition known as
hyperglycemia
. Over a long period,
can cause significant
damage to various organs and tissues
It is a
major cause
of critical health conditions such as
blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke
lower limb amputations
Epidemiological Study on Diabetes in India:
This study, conducted between
2008 and 2020
, sampled
1.2 lakh individuals
across the country. The participants included
33,537 urban residents
79,506 rural residents
31 States and Union Territories
Types of Diabetes:
Type 1 Diabetes:
It is an
autoimmune condition
where the body’s
immune system
destroys the
insulin-producing beta cells
in the pancreas. As a result, the body produces
very little or no insulin
Patients with Type 1 diabetes require
daily administration of insulin
to keep their blood glucose levels under control.
This condition is usually diagnosed in
children and young adults
and was earlier referred to as
juvenile diabetes
common symptoms
of Type 1 diabetes include: Excessive urination (
polyuria
), Extreme thirst (
polydipsia
), Constant hunger,
Unexplained weight loss, Vision changes, Fatigue
Type 2 Diabetes:
It results from the body’s
ineffective use of insulin
, even though it may produce the hormone.
This type of diabetes accounts for
more than 95%
of all diabetes cases globally.
The primary causes of Type 2 diabetes are
excess body weight
lack of physical activity
of Type 2 diabetes are often
less severe
compared to Type 1. Therefore, the disease may remain
undiagnosed for several years
, leading to delayed treatment.
Gestational Diabetes (GDM): GDM

**********How Does La Nina Affect India's Climate
What’s in Today’s Article?
About La Nina (Meaning, Impact, Impact on India, etc.)
Reasons for Delayed La Nina
Conclusion
What is La Niña?
La Niña is a phase of the
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
that occurs when
sea surface temperatures
in the
eastern and central Pacific Ocean
become cooler than usual.
It is the opposite of
, which brings warming in the same region. Both phases significantly influence
global weather patterns
How La Niña Affects Global Climate?
: Promotes
normal to above-normal monsoon rainfall
, leading to better agricultural yields.
Africa
: Causes drought-like conditions in certain regions.
Atlantic Ocean
: Intensifies
hurricanes
United States
: Southern states receive
increased rainfall
during La Niña.
La Niña and India’s Climate:
Winter Effects:
Colder Winters
: La Niña winters tend to bring
colder nights
in northern India but with slightly higher daytime temperatures.
Wind Speed and Pollution
Higher Wind Speeds
help disperse air pollution, improving air quality.
Lower Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH)
may trap pollutants closer to the ground, worsening pollution.
Current Scenario
: In 2024,
La Niña has not yet emerged
as expected, with a 57% probability of it developing later in the year.
Monsoons and Summers:
Enhanced Monsoons
: La Niña years (like
2020-2022
) have resulted in
normal to above-normal rainfall
Relief from Heat
: La Niña reduces summer intensity, offering relief from heatwaves seen during
El Niño years
El Niño Impact
: El Niño summers are
hotter
and often disrupt the monsoons, leading to droughts. For example, 2023, an El Niño year, saw below-normal rainfall.
Why Is La Niña Delayed in 2024?
La Niña usually forms during the
pre-monsoon
monsoon season
However, in 2024, it has been unusually delayed, with
Oceanic Niño Index (ONI)
hovering at -0.3°C (threshold for La Niña is -0.5°C or lower).
If La Niña forms, it would bring the following:
Cooler winters in
Stronger monsoons in
summer 2025
Meteorological Indices to Identify La Niña:
La Niña is declared based on specific indices such as:
: Measures average sea surface temperature anomalies
Persistence Rule
: Values must consistently stay at or below the threshold (-0.5°C for La Niña) for five consecutive readings.
Climate Change and ENSO Events:
Climate change is likely to increase the
frequency and intensity
of both La Niña and El Niño events due to rising ocean and atmospheric temperatures.
Extreme La Niña events could amplify impacts like
harsh winters
intense rainfall
in India.
Significance of La Niña for India:
Agriculture
: Boosts
crop production
due to strong monsoons, aiding farmers.
Water Resources
: Improves reservoir levels, reducing water stress.
Energy
: More rainfall ensures better
hydropower generation
: Less severe heatwaves compared to El Niño years.
Conclusion:
The delayed emergence of La Niña in 2024 has brought uncertainties regarding its impact on winter and monsoons.
If La Niña sets in early 2025, it could ensure a
strong monsoon season
, crucial for India’s agriculture and water resources.
Monitoring
ENSO patterns
is vital to understanding and preparing for its climatic effects.

**********Hydroxymethanesulphonate
Recently, scientists have discovered a chemical pathway that worsens air quality in extremely cold winters, involving the formation of hydroxymethanesulphonate in aerosol particles. These findings were published in Science Advances and highlight changes in aerosol chemistry under supercooled conditions in cold regions.
Key Findings of the Study:
Hydroxymethanesulphonate Formation
: It is a
secondary aerosol
, that forms when
formaldehyde
reacts with
sulphur dioxide
in the presence of
liquid water
Traditionally thought to occur only in
clouds and fog
, but found to occur in
in Fairbanks winters.
Role of Temperature
: Extremely low temperatures
(around -35
0
C)
cause
supercooling
of aerosol particles, where liquid water remains unfrozen below its freezing point.
Supercooled aerosols allow
to form within them.
Aerosol acidity dynamics
: Aerosol acidity depends on the relative concentration of:
Sulphate ions (SO₄²⁻)
→ Increase acidity.
Ammonium ions (NH₄⁺)
→ Neutralize acidity.
Post-2022 sulphur fuel ban in Fairbanks:
Sulphate ion concentrations dropped.
Ammonium ion levels increased, reducing aerosol acidity.
Ammonium dynamics in cold weather:
In low temperatures,
ammonium ions
are less likely to evaporate into
ammonia gas
. This buildup of ammonium ions further reduces acidity, creating favourable conditions for
hydroxymethanesulphonate formation
Key Concepts
What are Aerosols?
: Tiny
solid or liquid particles
suspended in the air.
Examples: Dust, smoke, fog, or chemical particles like sulphates and ammonium.
What is PM2.5?
PM2.5:
Fine particulate matter with a diameter
less than 2.5 micrometres (µm)
Significance:
Penetrates the lungs and bloodstream.
Causes reduced
lung function
asthma aggravation
premature deaths
Supercooling:
Process where
remains unfrozen even at temperatures below
0°C
Allows formation of
in aerosol particles at very low temperatures.

**********Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
Recently, a famous tabla maestro and five-time Grammy Award winner passed away in San Francisco due to Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).
About
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis:
It is a serious chronic disease that
affects the tissue surrounding the air sacs,
or alveoli, in the lungs.
The
lung tissue becomes thick and stiff
for unknown reasons — causing permanent scarring in the lungs over time.
can make it progressively more difficult to breathe for the patient.
Complications from IPF include
pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure
, which happen when the lungs cannot deliver enough oxygen into the bloodstream without support. This prevents the brain and other organs from getting the oxygen they need.
Individuals with a history of
smoking or a family history
of IPF are at higher risk. The
risk also increases with age,
making older adults more susceptible to developing the disease.
Symptoms
Common symptoms include
shortness of breath and a dry cough
— both of which are likely to get worse over time.
Patients might also have
aching muscles and joints
as well as feeling extreme tiredness.
A gradual,

**********1948 debate on Uniform Civil Code - What Ambedkar, KM Munshi said
Why in news?
PM Modi reiterated his support for a nationwide Uniform Civil Code (UCC) during a discussion in the Lok Sabha on the 75-year journey of the Constitution.
He highlighted that the Constituent Assembly extensively debated the UCC and envisioned its implementation by future governments. The Prime Minister quoted Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, who advocated for ending religion-based personal laws, and K.M. Munshi, who viewed the UCC as essential for national unity and modernization.
Emphasizing the vision of the Constitution’s drafters, he stated that the government is working with full commitment to establish a “secular civil code.”
What’s in today’s article?
UCC debate in Constituent Assembly
KM Munshi’s Support for the UCC
Ambedkar’s Support for UCC in Principle
Outcome of the Debate on Article 35
About
A UCC would provide for one law for the entire country, applicable to all religious communities, in their personal matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption etc.
In other words, UCC is a set of rules/regulations, which proposes to replace the personal laws based on the scriptures and customs of each major religious community in the country with a common set governing every citizen.
Constitutional position
Article 44 of the Constitution lays down that the state shall endeavour to secure a UCC for citizens throughout the territory of India.
Article 44 is among the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP).
Directive Principles are not enforceable by court, but are supposed to inform and guide governance.
Background of the UCC Debate
On November 23, 1948, the Constituent Assembly debated a draft Article 35 (now Article 44) on the UCC, which was included in the DPSP.
The draft stated that the State would aim to secure a UCC for all citizens of India.
However, concerns were raised about its impact on religious communities, leading to its non-binding inclusion under the DPSPs.
Opposition to the UCC:
Several members expressed apprehensions.
Mohamad Ismail Sahib of the Indian Union Muslim League argued that a uniform code would not necessarily ensure harmony but could lead to discontent by interfering with personal laws.
Naziruddin Ahmad echoed similar concerns, stating that religious laws, deeply connected with beliefs and practices, should remain untouched.
Supported UCC
K. M. Munshi strongly advocated for the UCC, countering the criticism that it would be “tyrannical” to minorities.
He pointed out that
even advanced Muslim countries had not treated personal laws as sacrosanct to hinder a civil code
Munshi also addressed Hindu opposition to the UCC, particularly regarding laws on inheritance and succession, which were seen as part of religion.
He argued that
without a UCC, gender equality could not be achieved
Highlighting discrimination against women in Hindu law, Munshi stated that a civil code was essential to elevate the position of women to equality with men, as enshrined in the Fundamental Rights.
UCC and National Unity
Munshi linked the UCC to national integration, urging the Muslim members to abandon an “isolationist outlook.”
He emphasized that religion should be confined to its legitimate sphere, while the rest of life must be regulated to unify and strengthen the nation.
He argued that the UCC would not be tyrannical to minorities but instead foster a stronger, consolidated nation.
Ambedkar’s position
B.R. Ambedkar, while advocating for Article 35 (now Article 44), refrained from discussing the merits or demerits of implementing a Uniform Civil Code (UCC). However, he defended its inclusion in the DPSP.
India’s Existing Uniformity in Laws
Ambedkar countered the argument that a uniform code was unfeasible in a diverse and vast country like India.
He highlighted the existence of a uniform legal system in areas such as criminal law, which is uniformly enforced through the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
Challenging the Notion of Uniformity in Muslim Personal Law
Ambedkar questioned the claim that Muslim personal law had always been uniform across India. He cited examples:
North-West Frontier Province followed Hindu Law in matters of succession until 1935.
Regions like United Provinces, Central Provinces, and Bombay periodically operated under Hindu law in specific matters.
Limiting Religion’s Jurisdiction
Ambedkar argued against religion having “vast, expansive jurisdiction” that would prevent legislative reforms.
He stressed the need for liberty to reform India’s social system, which he described as rife with “inequities, inequalities, and discrimination.”
He opposed excluding personal laws from the jurisdiction of the State.
Power to Legislate, Not Immediate Enforcement
Ambedkar reassured apprehensive members that granting the State the power to legislate on personal laws did not mean immediate or objectionable enforcement.
He emphasized that the government must respect and reconcile with the sentiments of different communities while exercising this power.
At the end of the debate, Article 35 was put to vote and passed. It was later renumbered as Article 44 of the Indian Constitution.
Constitutional law experts noted that while Article 44 states, “the state shall endeavour”, other Directive Principles use stronger phrases like “shall in particular direct its policy” or “shall be obligation of the state
”.
This indicates that the
state's duty to implement Article 44 is comparatively less emphasized than other Directive Principles

**********Religion and Reservation
Why in news?
Recently, the Supreme Court orally observed that “
Reservation cannot be on the basis of religion
”. The apex court was hearing a challenge to the Calcutta High Court’s decision in May to strike down reservations granted to 77 classes — predominantly from the Muslim community — within the quota for Other Backward Classes (OBC).
Earlier, in November 2024, the Supreme Court denied Scheduled Caste (SC) status to a woman who had converted to Christianity.
Through these instances, the relationship between religion and reservations has once again been brought into focus. Since the Constitution of India came into force in 1950, both the Centre and the Supreme Court have attempted to define the extent to which religion can be considered for providing reservation benefits.
What’s in today’s article?
Religion as criteria for OBC reservations
Religious Restriction in SC Status
Key Issues Awaiting Supreme Court Adjudication
Constitutional Framework for Religious Groups in Reservations
There is no
express prohibition on identifying religious groups as beneficiaries of OBC or Scheduled Tribe reservations
However, such efforts have primarily been within the OBC category.
Article 16(4) of the Constitution empowers states to provide reservations for “any backward class of citizens” inadequately represented in state services.
Kerala has included Muslims within the OBC quota since 1956, followed by Karnataka in 1995 and Tamil Nadu in 2007.
Karnataka and the Role of Backward Classes Commissions
In Karnataka, reservations for Muslims were introduced based on the Third Backward Classes Commission report (1990) chaired by Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy.
The report identified Muslims “as a whole” as socially and economically backward.
Similarly, the Justice Rajender Sachar Committee report (2006) highlighted the “abysmally low” representation of Muslim OBCs in Central Government departments.
It emphasized that the benefits of backward class entitlements had yet to reach them.
Indra Sawhney Judgment and Its Significance
The Supreme Court’s
Indra Sawhney v Union of India
(1992) judgment clarified that OBC reservations aimed to address historical discrimination.
It ruled that while religion, race, caste, and other group identities were relevant, they could not be the sole criterion for granting reservations.
This ensured backwardness was determined objectively
Calcutta High Court Decision (2024)
In May, 2024, the Calcutta High Court struck down OBC reservations for 77 classes, 75 of which were Muslim, as the reservations were granted without objective criteria to determine backwardness.
The court observed that
religion appeared to be the sole basis for declaring these communities as OBCs
, which violated the principles laid down in the Indra Sawhney case.
Constitutional Basis for Scheduled Caste (SC) Reservations
Article 341(1) of the Constitution empowers the President to specify castes, races, or tribes deemed to be Scheduled Castes (SCs) for the purposes of the Constitution.
Accordingly,
The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 was issued
, listing SC communities state-wise.
Religion as a barrier in SC reservations
Clause 3 of the 1950 order states that individuals professing religions other than Hinduism, Sikhism, or Buddhism cannot be considered Scheduled Castes.
Initially limited to Hindus, the order was expanded to include SC Hindus converting to Sikhism in 1956 and Buddhism in 1990.
Judicial Position: Soosai v. Union of India (1985)
In the Soosai case, a cobbler from the Adi-Dravida SC community was denied benefits after converting to Christianity.
The Supreme Court did not answer whether a religious convert would retain their caste status after conversion but held
this would not be sufficient to access SC benefits
A person must prove that
caste-based social handicaps continue to exist with oppressive severity in the new religious environment
Ranganath Mishra Commission Recommendations (2007)
Constituted in 2004, it found that the caste system transcends religious boundaries and affects all Indian communities.
It recommended that a change of religion should not affect a person’s SC status once included in the SC list
However, the Centre has rejected these findings in recent years, leading to periodic halts in efforts to include converts from Christianity and Islam under SC reservations.
Challenge to the 1950 Scheduled Castes Order
The constitutional validity of the 1950 Scheduled Castes order, particularly clause 3, is under scrutiny in the
Ghazi Saaduddin v. State of Maharashtra
case, pending since 2004.
In 2011, the Supreme Court decided to examine the constitutionality of this clause.
However, in April 2024, the court deferred hearings, noting that the Centre had formed a new commission to review whether religious converts should retain SC status.
The K G Balakrishnan Commission
The Centre rejected the Ranganath Mishra Commission’s 2007 recommendations, which supported extending SC benefits to converts.
Instead, it formed a new commission chaired by former Chief Justice of India K G Balakrishnan to assess the issue.
The commission has conducted public hearings across states and received an extension in November 2024 to submit its report by October 2025.
Debate on OBC Reservations for Religious Groups
The Supreme Court is also addressing whether OBC reservations can be provided to religious groups as a whole.
In 2005, the Andhra Pradesh government introduced a law granting 5% OBC reservations to Muslims, which the AP High Court struck down the same year.
The High Court ruled that the government failed to apply objective criteria for classifying Muslims as a backward class.
Though the SC stated it would hear this case after deciding the challenge to reservations for Economically Weaker Sections, which it did on November 7, 2022, there has been no movement on the matter.

**********India’s wage challenge has shifted from chronic to immediate
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related to employment;
Why in the news?
India’s low wages pose a significant challenge, but adopting a ground-level perspective on employers’ daily realities highlights policy measures to increase the number of high-productivity employers.
What are the root causes of the current wage stagnation in India?
Economic Structure:
The shift from agriculture to non-farm jobs has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in productivity. Despite significant government spending, the flow of jobs since 1991 has not reduced farm employment, leading to wage stagnation in rural areas.
Global Economic Changes:
Manufacturing jobs have become less labour-intensive because of automation, resulting in fewer jobs per unit of investment.
Additionally, rising tariffs and a weaker global growth outlook contribute to wage stagnation.
Regulatory Environment:
The existing regulatory framework creates barriers for entrepreneurs, leading to a lack of job creation in higher-paying sectors. The complexity and rigidity of regulations discourage investment in productive enterprises.
Skill Mismatch:
There is a disparity between the skills available in the labour market and those demanded by employers. Many workers remain under-skilled for the higher-paying jobs that are available, perpetuating low wages.
How can India effectively implement a living wage system?
ensures workers earn enough to meet basic needs like food, housing, healthcare, and education, enabling a decent standard of living beyond mere subsistence wages.
Policy Framework:
Establishing a clear definition of what constitutes a living wage based on local cost of living metrics is essential. This framework should be adaptable to different regions and sectors.
Incentives for Employers:
Providing tax breaks or subsidies for businesses that pay living wages can encourage compliance and support workers’ livelihoods.
Strengthening Labor Rights
: Ensuring robust enforcement of labor laws that protect workers’ rights to fair wages and safe working conditions is crucial for implementing a living wage system effectively.
Public Awareness Campaigns:
Educating both employers and employees about the benefits of a living wage can help shift perceptions and practices within the workforce.
What are the wage disparities in India?
Gender Wage Gap:
According to the Global Gender Gap Index 2024, Indian women earn only ₹40 for every ₹100 earned by men, highlighting a significant gender pay disparity.
The economic gender parity level in India is recorded at 39.8%, indicating that while some progress has been made, substantial gaps remain in economic participation and remuneration between genders.
Regional Wage Disparities:
The average daily wage for casual workers in rural areas is approximately ₹104, significantly lower than the national average of ₹247 per day for all workers.
Wage Inequality Metrics:
The Gini coefficient for wages in India stands at 0.49, indicating a high level of wage inequality. The D9/D1 wage ratio, which compares the earnings of the top 10% to the bottom 10%, is 6.7, underscoring the stark contrast in earnings across different segments of the workforce.
Note:
is a measure of income inequality that compares the earnings of the
top 10% of wage earners (D9) to the earnings of the bottom 10% (D1)
within a given population
What policy measures can be taken to address wage disparities and ensure fair compensation? (Way forward)
Rationalisation of Regulations:
Streamlining regulatory frameworks to reduce bureaucratic hurdles can encourage entrepreneurship and job creation. This includes removing unnecessary jail provisions that deter business operations.
Investing in Human Capital:
Prioritizing skill development programs aligned with market demands can boost employability and empower workers to secure higher-paying jobs.
Encouraging Non-Farm Employment:
Policies should focus on fostering private, productive non-farm jobs through digitisation and formalization, paving the way for better wages.
Strengthening Redistribution Mechanisms:
Adopting progressive taxation on higher profits can fund social programs designed to uplift wage levels across different sectors.
Fostering Long-Term Economic Planning:
Crafting a comprehensive economic strategy aligned with labour market needs is essential for ensuring sustainable wage growth and effectively addressing disparities.
Mains PYQ:
Can the strategy of regional-resource-based manufacturing help in promoting employment in India?

**********The hidden cost of greenwashing the Indian Railways
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to the electrification of transport;
Why in the news?
The ‘Mission 100% Electrification’ project is like chasing an unrealistic dream of becoming a green railway, leading to many usable diesel locomotives becoming unnecessary.
What are the key points of the report?
Export of Repurposed Locomotives
: RITES Ltd. is exporting six refurbished broad-gauge diesel locomotives to African railways after complex gauge conversion, marking a first in such re-engineering.
Idle Diesel Locomotives
: Around 760 diesel locomotives, with over 60% still serviceable, are redundant due to the rapid electrification of the railway network.
Limited Environmental and Economic Gains
: Electrification reduces only 2% of diesel consumption, while coal-powered electricity (50% of the total) negates environmental benefits, maintaining reliance on polluting sources.
Strategic Contradictions
: Despite targeting 100% electrification, Indian Railways plans to retain 3,500 diesel locomotives for disaster management and traffic needs, undercutting “green” claims.
Policy and Financial Wastage
: The rushed electrification drive has led to premature asset redundancy, wasting public funds without ensuring environmental or financial sustainability.
What constitutes greenwashing in the context of Indian Railways?
Misleading Claims of Environmental Benefits:
The Indian Railways’ push for 100% electrification is framed as a move towards a “green railway.” However, this initiative overlooks the fact that a significant portion of the electricity generated in India comes from coal-fired power plants, which are environmentally harmful.
Thus, the transition from diesel to electric locomotives may merely shift pollution from one source to another without achieving genuine environmental benefits.
Redundancy of Serviceable Assets:
The decision to electrify the railway network has led to the premature stabling of functional diesel locomotives, many of which have considerable residual life left.
This not only represents a waste of resources but also raises questions about the actual motivations behind electrification efforts.
Focus on Slogans Over Substance:
The Mission 100% Electrification initiative appears to prioritize headline-grabbing goals over comprehensive and well-thought-out policies.
This approach can be seen as greenwashing, as it promotes an image of environmental responsibility while failing to address the underlying issues related to energy sourcing and pollution.
How do greenwashing practices impact public perception and trust?
Erosion of Credibility:
When organizations like Indian Railways promote initiatives that are not genuinely sustainable, it can lead to public scepticism regarding their commitment to environmental issues.
Misallocation of Resources:
Public perception may shift towards viewing government initiatives as wasteful or misguided, leading to decreased support for future projects that could have real environmental benefits.
Increased Public Scrutiny:
Greenwashing practices often lead to increased scrutiny from activists, media, and the public.
As stakeholders demand transparency and accountability, organizations may face backlash for failing to deliver on their environmental promises.
What regulatory measures can be implemented to combat greenwashing in the transportation sector? (Way forward)
Clear Guidelines for Environmental Claims:
Establishing stringent regulations that define what constitutes legitimate environmental benefits can help prevent misleading claims.
Organizations should be required to substantiate their claims with verifiable data and transparent reporting.
Mandatory Sustainability Reporting:
Implementing requirements for regular sustainability audits and reporting can ensure that transportation entities disclose their actual environmental impact, including emissions data and energy sources used.
Public Accountability Mechanisms:
Creating independent bodies to assess and review claims made by transportation sectors regarding sustainability initiatives can enhance accountability.
These bodies could provide certifications or ratings based on genuine environmental performance rather than promotional claims.
Incentives for Genuine Sustainability Efforts:
Providing financial incentives or recognition for organizations that implement effective sustainability measures can encourage genuine efforts rather than superficial compliance with green initiatives.

**********Green hydrogen and the financing challenge
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Significance and issues related to hydrogen;
Why in the news?
India aims to produce 5 million metric tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030 to lead in the sector and reduce emissions, but the high costs of financing may hinder this goal.
Hydrogen fuel comes in three types:
Grey hydrogen (produced from natural gas), Blue hydrogen (Grey hydrogen with carbon capture), and Green hydrogen (produced using renewable energy through electrolysis, with no emissions).
What are the key financial barriers to scaling green hydrogen production?
High Production Costs
: The cost of producing green hydrogen is significantly higher ($5.30-$6.70 per kg) compared to traditional grey/blue hydrogen ($1.9-$2.4 per kg). This price disparity makes green hydrogen economically uncompetitive and deters investment and offtake.
High Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
: In emerging markets like India, higher perceived risks increase borrowing costs. This results in a high WACC, which heavily influences the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and the overall cost of green hydrogen production.
High Electrolyzer Costs
: The current costs of electrolyzers, ranging from $500-1,400/kW for alkaline and $1,100-1,800/kW for proton exchange membrane systems, further strain the financial viability of green hydrogen projects.
Scaling Challenge
: Green hydrogen production costs can only decrease with scaled production, but scaling up requires financial viability. The market faces a catch-22 situation: without economies of scale, production remains expensive, and without lowering costs, scaling is unfeasible.
How can innovative financing mechanisms be developed?
Blended Finance Models
: Combining public and private capital can help lower risks and make investments in green hydrogen more attractive. Government-backed financial instruments or concessional loans can reduce borrowing costs, lowering WACC.
Green Bonds and Climate Financing
: The issuance of green bonds to raise capital for renewable energy projects can provide long-term funding at lower costs. These bonds can appeal to investors with an interest in sustainable investments.
Private-Public Partnerships (PPP)
: Collaborations between government and private sectors can help mitigate risks and ensure the financing of green hydrogen projects. To attract private investors, governments can provide financial support through incentives, subsidies, or tax breaks.
Carbon Credits and Offtake Agreements
: Green hydrogen projects could leverage carbon credits or long-term offtake agreements to secure steady revenue streams, which would increase investor confidence and help finance production scale-up.
What role do policy frameworks play in facilitating investment in green hydrogen?
Incentives and Subsidies
: Government policies offering subsidies, tax incentives, or feed-in tariffs can help offset the high initial costs of green hydrogen production and encourage private investment.
Long-Term Policy Clarity
: Clear, stable, and long-term policy frameworks provide certainty to investors, reducing perceived risks and lowering the cost of capital. Such policies could include long-term targets for green hydrogen production, financing support, and infrastructure development.
Regulatory Support for Innovation
: Governments can encourage innovation by providing regulatory frameworks that support new technologies, such as electrolyzers and advanced hydrogen storage solutions, ensuring the rapid scaling of green hydrogen.
Market Creation and Demand-Driven Initiatives
: Policies that create demand for green hydrogen, such as mandatory usage targets for industries like steel, transportation, or chemicals, can drive off-take agreements and ensure market stability.
