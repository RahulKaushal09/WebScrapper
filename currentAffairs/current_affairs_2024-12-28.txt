THE SAHEL CRISIS
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – GEOGRAPHY ; GS 2
Context:
The Sahel region of Africa possesses vast resources, but its population remains enmeshed in poverty, famine, political instability and warfare. In the last two years, there have been military coups in Niger, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Chad.
Background: –

A number of factors contribute to the plight of people in the Sahel region including weak state institutions, military coups, and external exploitation of its resources.
Key takeaways
The Sahel is a region in western and north-central Africa that extends eastward from Senegal to Sudan, forming a transitional zone between the arid Sahara Desert to the north and humid Savannas to the south.
As per the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS), the region has ten countries, i.e. Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria.
With its abundance of resources, including uranium, gold, and oil, the Sahel is one of the world’s most endowed regions. For instance, Mali is Africa’s third-largest gold producer, and Burkina Faso is the fourth-largest and fastest-growing producer of gold in the African Continent, and Niger is the world’s leading source of uranium.
Factors behind coups in the Sahel
In recent years, there have been military coups in Mali (2020 and 2021), Niger (2023), Burkina Faso (2022), Guinea (2021), and Chad (2021).
The inability of civilian governments to effectively control large territory, popular frustration with the deteriorating security, and the lack of economic and social progress are some of the major factors that contributed to military takeovers.
Military usually capitalise on the widespread popular disenchantment with the elected governments to seize power. But they rarely have long-term vision.
The rivalry among global powers in this unstable area has been the primary reason behind the political instability.
Struggle for socio-economic development
On the HDI, the countries of the region are in the bottom ten. In response to the crisis in Mali, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2056, which led to the creation of UNISS in 2013. The strategy focuses on six critical areas: cross-border cooperation, prevention and sustaining peace, economic revitalisation and inclusive growth, climate action, renewable energy, and women and youth empowerment.
The objectives of UNISS were intended to contribute to achieving both the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. However, the recent spate of military coups has revealed the failure of the policies in addressing the region’s root causes of instability.
External factors
The Sahara-Sahel region has emerged as a new geopolitical hotspot, driven by a mix of weak states, interfering global powers, and transnational non-state actors.
For much of modern history, the region has been France-centric, with French forces frequently intervening to control and influence regional security.
The people of the Sahel continue to suffer in poverty because their leaders, along with their former colonial power, continued to exploit them. For instance, Niger was providing France with the majority of its uranium at a fraction of its market value.
However, France’s aggressive intervention in 2013, encountered substantial resistance from local non-state actors and widespread resentment. This provided powers like Russia with an opportunity. Russia’s foothold in Libya, where it consolidated power through military groups like Wagner Group contractors, enabled it to position itself as an alternative security provider and expand its presence into Mali and Burkina Faso – countries that had grown disillusioned with France’s military presence.
The failure of French foreign policy in the region has resulted in a power rivalry between France and Russia. The NATO intervention in Libya led to a surge in trans-Saharan terrorism and crime, created new security challenges. This failure of NATO provided Russia with an opportunity to fill the void.
The Sahel’s turmoil and India’s role
Reliance on security-focused international dependence has failed to address the root causes of violence, poverty, and instability in the Sahel. In particular, the failure of the French efforts, which were largely focused on countering jihadism through militarisation and retaining its status as the dominant external player in Africa, has been detrimental.
The international community’s role should focus on strengthening state institutions rather than prioritising self-serving resource extraction and security/military objectives. It should support Sahelian governments in a way that avoids creating perpetual external dependence.
There are significant ramifications for India. The Sahel serves as a prime example of a geopolitical hotspot that could escalate tensions, potentially leading to a larger east-west conflict. The resulting upheaval would have a negative impact on India’s ambitions of becoming a global powerhouse. Moreover, India depends on critical resources such as oil, gas, and uranium from the Sahel and its surroundings. Therefore, India needs to engage meaningfully in efforts to stabilise the region.

CHINA APPROVES WORLD’S LARGEST DAM ON BRAHMAPUTRA RIVER
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
China has approved the construction of the world’s largest dam, stated to be the planet’s biggest infra project costing USD 137 billion, on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet close to the Indian border.
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-200816 aligncenter" decoding="async" height="196" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/china-300x196.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/china-300x196.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/china.png 633w" width="300"/>
The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river which flows through Southwestern China, Northeastern India, and Bangladesh. It is known as Brahmaputra or Luit in Assamese, Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibetan, the Siang/Dihang River in Arunachali, and Jamuna River in Bengali.
The Chinese government has approved the construction of a hydropower project in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River.
The dam is to be built at a huge gorge in the Himalayan reaches where the Brahmaputra river makes a huge U-turn to flow into Arunachal Pradesh.
The dam could produce 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. That would more than triple the 88.2 billion kWh designed capacity of the Three Gorges Dam, currently the world’s largest, in central China.
The Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra river as it leaves Tibet and flows south into India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states and finally into Bangladesh.
The Brahmaputra Dam presents enormous engineering challenges as the project site is located along a tectonic plate boundary where earthquakes occur. The Tibetan plateau, regarded as the roof of the world, frequently experiences earthquakes as it is located over the tectonic plates.
Concerns arose in India as the dam besides empowering China to control the water flow, the size and scale of it could also enable Beijing to release large amounts of water flooding border areas in times of hostilities.

HIGH ARSENIC LEVELS IN STAPLE FOODS
Prelims & Mains – ENVIRONMENT
Arsenic contamination, long a concern in Bihar’s water supply, has now been detected at alarming levels in staple foods such as rice, wheat and potatoes, posing significant health risks to thousands, particularly in rural areas.
A study conducted by researchers from Patna-based Mahavir Cancer Sansthan and Research Centre has revealed high arsenic concentrations in these staple foods in 11 arsenic hotspot districts of Bihar. The findings underscored an urgent public health challenge as the food chain becomes increasingly contaminated.
Arsenic is a naturally occurring metalloid found in the Earth’s crust, existing in both organic and inorganic forms.
Inorganic arsenic compounds, typically more toxic, are commonly associated with groundwater contamination.
Health Impacts
Arsenicosis: Long-term exposure to arsenic-contaminated water can lead to arsenicosis, which includes skin lesions, cancer (skin, bladder, kidney, lung), and other health issues such as hypertension and diabetes.
Arsenic is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
Non-Carcinogenic Risks: Prolonged exposure can also cause non-carcinogenic health risks such as skin pigmentation changes and hard patches on palms and soles.
Arsenic Contamination in India:
In India, arsenic contamination of groundwater is a significant public health concern, particularly in the alluvial plains of the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin. The primary states affected include West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, and Chhattisgarh.
In these regions, arsenic concentrations in groundwater often exceed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) permissible limit of 10 µg/L.
A study focusing on the Middle Ganga Plain in Bihar revealed that individuals consuming arsenic-laden water exhibited elevated arsenic levels in urine, hair, and nails, correlating with the concentrations found in their drinking water.
Sources and Mechanisms:
The primary source of arsenic in Indian groundwater is geological, with arsenic naturally present in the sediments of the GBM basin. Alluvial aquifers, which constitute about 90% of the affected regions, are particularly susceptible.
In these aquifers, arsenic is released into groundwater under specific geochemical conditions, often exacerbated by human activities such as excessive groundwater extraction and the use of certain pesticides.

**********Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)
RBI's Recent Report on the Rupee's Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)
About NEER and REER:
NEER (Nominal Effective Exchange Rate):
It is the
weighted average of a currency’s bilateral exchange rates
with multiple trading partner currencies.
NEER reflects the
nominal strength
of a currency but does not adjust for
inflation or price level differences
A rise in NEER indicates nominal appreciation, while a decline signals depreciation.
REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate):
An improvement over NEER, it adjusts for
relative price levels
(inflation) between domestic and foreign economies.
Calculated as:
NEER × (Domestic Price Index ÷ Foreign Price Index).
It is a
purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted
measure of competitiveness.
Currency basket for India’s Indices:
Earlier, the NEER and REER indices included six major currencies:
US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Chinese Yuan (CNY), and Singapore Dollar (SGD)
The indices now encompass a
broader basket of 36 currencies
, reflecting India’s diverse trade relations.
Factors influencing NEER and REER:
Productivity Differences:
Affect competitiveness and influence REER values.
Terms of Trade:
The balance of exports and imports can impact both indices.
Inflation:
Higher inflation erodes currency value, affecting REER.
Fiscal Spending:
Impacts economic stability and demand, influencing exchange rate dynamics.
Key Updates on REER:
Record High REER:
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reported that the rupee's Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) reached
14 in November 2024
, increasing from
107.20 in October 2024
. This marks its highest level this year.
Implications of Overvaluation:
REER value above 100
signifies that the rupee is overvalued relative to the base year (2015-16), leading to
reduced export competitiveness
while making imports cheaper.

**********How Sea Otters Are Saving Coastal Ecosystems
A recovering population of sea otters in California, especially in the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, has helped curb green crab proliferation.
About Sea Otter:
This aquatic member of the weasel family is found along the coasts of the Pacific Ocean in North America and Asia.
It spends most of its time in the water but, in some locations, comes ashore to sleep or rest.
Sea otters
were extensively hunted in the
18th and 19th centuries
for their
thick, soft fur
Their numbers rebounded after being listed as
threatened and federally protected
1977
Sea otters consume
50,000 to 120,000 green crabs annually
, effectively controlling their population. This marks a significant solution to the invasive species problem on the
West Coast of the United States
Unlike other marine mammals, sea otters rely on a
high metabolism
rather than blubber to stay warm in cold oceans. They consume about
25% of their body weight daily
, making them
voracious predators
Sea otters have
webbed feet, water-repellent fur
to keep them dry and warm, and
nostrils and ears
that close in the water.
Green Crab (Portunus Sanguinolentus):
The green crab is a
common littoral crab
, recognized globally by names such as
shore crab
green shore crab
in the British Isles. It is one of the top 100
“world's worst alien invasive species”
, showcasing its
invasive nature
Habitat
: Native to the
Atlantic Ocean
Baltic Sea
, but now spread to
Australia
South America
South Africa
Physical Features
At maturity, the
carapace width
measures about
90 mm
Colouration varies between
green, brown, grey, and red
, with delayed moulting causing red colouration.
Diet
: Feeds on
small crustaceans, molluscs, and worms
Impact on Ecosystems
: The
green crab’s invasive behaviour
harms coastal ecosystems by:
Damaging seagrass beds
, critical habitats for various marine species.
Overhunting prey species
, crucial for the survival of other native species.
Outcompeting native species
for resources like food and habitat.

**********Household Consumption Expenditure Survey
India’s average household consumption spending on a per capita basis rose about 3.5% in real terms through August 2023 to July 2024 from a year ago, as per the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES).
About
Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES):
It is designed to collect information on consumption and expenditure of the
households on goods and services.
It provides data required to
assess trends in economic well-being
and to determine and update the basket of consumer goods and services and weights
used for the calculation of the Consumer Price Index
Data collected in HCES is also
used to measure poverty, inequality, and social exclusion
The
Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure
(MPCE) compiled from HCES is the primary indicator used for most analytical purposes.
As in HCES 2022-23, in HCES 2023-24 also, two sets of estimates of MPCE have been generated:
Without considering
imputed values of items received
free of cost
by the households through
various social welfare programmes
Considering imputed
values of items received free of cost by the households through various social welfare programmes.
This survey is conducted by
National Sample Survey Office
(NSSO) under the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI).
Important Findings of HCES 2023-24:
In nominal prices, the
average MPCE (without imputation) in 2023-24 increases
by about 9% in rural areas and 8% in urban areas from the level of 2022-23.
urban-rural gap in MPCE has declined
to 71% in 2022-23 from 84% in 2011-12. It has further come down to 70% in 2023-24 that confirms sustained momentum of consumption growth in rural areas.
When ranked by MPCE, the
increase in the average MPCE in 2023-24
from the level of 2022-23 has been the
maximum for the bottom 5 to 10 % of India’s population
, for both rural and urban areas.
Consistent with the trend observed in HCES:2022-23,
non-food items remain the major
contributor to the household’s average monthly expenditure in 2023-24
Beverages, refreshments and
processed food continues to have the major expenditure
share in 2023-24 in the food items basket of the rural and urban households.
Conveyance, clothing, bedding & footwear, miscellaneous goods & entertainment and durable goods have major expenditure share in non-food expenditure of the households in both rural and urban areas.
Consumption inequality,
both in rural and urban areas has
from the level of 2022-23. The Gini coefficient has declined to 0.237 in 2023-24 from 0.266 in 2022-23 for rural areas and to 0.284 in 2023-24 from 0.314 in 2022-23 for urban areas.

**********Heliobacter pylori
Researchers have found a way to develop FELUDA as a point-of-care diagnostic service at a minimal cost for detection of H. pylori and its mutations in dyspeptic patients from rural areas of India, with minimal or no access to diagnostic laboratories.
About
:
It is a common type of
bacteria
that grows in the
digestive tract
of human and tends to attack the stomach lining.
It is adapted to
live in the harsh, acidic
environment
of the stomach.
It infects a person usually during childhood. Its infections are usually harmless, but they are responsible for
most ulcers in the stomach and small intestine
, called peptic ulcers.
Infections with  pyloriaffect over
43 percent of the world’s population
with a wide range of gastrointestinal disorders, including peptic ulcers, gastritis, dyspepsia and even gastric cancer.
How it survives in stomach?
This bacterium can change the environment around it and
reduce the acidity so it can survive more easily.
The
spiral shape
of  pylori allows it to penetrate the stomach lining, where it’s protected by mucus and the body’s immune cells cannot reach it.
When signs or symptoms do occur with  pylori infection, they are typically related to gastritis or a peptic ulcer and may include:
An ache or
burning pain in stomach
(abdomen)
Nausea, loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss etc.
Treatment:

**********Rules That Still Manacle the Captive Elephant
Context
In India,
elephants hold a revered status as sacred symbols of wisdom and strength
, deeply embedded in cultural and religious traditions.
However,
their lives in captivity starkly contrast with these ideals
. Privately held captive elephants are subjected to systematic exploitation and cruelty, particularly when used for religious ceremonies, tourism, or entertainment.
Despite legislative efforts like the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972
and the Captive Elephant (Transfer or Transport) Rules of 2024,
loopholes and inadequate enforcement continue to perpetuate their suffering.
An Overview of Captive Elephants and Systemic Cruelty
, known for their social and intelligent nature,
are often subjected to isolation, harsh training, and abusive conditions to make them compliant.
The
Kerala High Court’s comparison of their lives to an eternal Treblinka underscores the severity of their suffering.
These majestic animals are coerced into performing unnatural behaviours
, driven by practices that break their spirits.
While the Wildlife (Protection) Act grants elephants the highest level of legal protection
, its implementation has been undermined by practices like capturing wild elephants for private ownership.
The economic valuation of elephants as commodities
, rather than sentient beings,
has led to their objectification and abuse, turning them into tools for income generation.
Flaws in the 2024 Captive Elephant Rules
Ambiguity in Ownership Transfers
One of the most glaring issues lies in the
provision allowing the transfer of ownership when an owner is unable to maintain an elephant.
rules fail to specify that such transfers must be non-commercial
. This omission effectively allows elephants to be bought and sold as property.
absence of safeguards creates a grey area
where owners can exploit these provisions to profit from the sale of elephants under the guise of financial inability to care for them.
commercial aspect undermines the very essence of wildlife protection laws
, which are meant to ensure that elephants, as protected species, are not subjected to market forces.
Instead of fostering a culture of conservation and ethical care, this loophole normalises the commodification of elephants,
treating them as assets to be traded.
Lack of Justification for Transportation
rules also permit the temporary transportation of elephants
across or within state borders without requiring owners to provide explicit justification.
lack of transparency and accountability opens the door for the misuse of elephants
for purposes that compromise their welfare.
For instance,
states with a high number of privately owned elephants may lease them out
for activities ranging from religious ceremonies to political rallies.
Such practices not only subject elephants to stressful and unnatural environments
but also reinforce the perception of elephants as tools for human entertainment and profit.
Moreover,
frequent transportation can lead to physical and psychological stress,
as elephants are forced to adapt to unfamiliar surroundings and conditions.
Institutionalising Exploitation Through Regularisation
regularisation of transfers and transportation of elephants
for religious, tourism, or commercial ventures
further entrenches their economic valuation.
By failing to explicitly prohibit these activities,
the rules indirectly incentivize the use of elephants as revenue-generating tools.
institutionalised exploitation encourages private owners to prioritise profits
over the well-being of the animals, thereby perpetuating a cycle of abuse.
Insufficient Monitoring and Accountability
While the rules stipulate procedures for transportation and transfer,
they lack robust mechanisms to ensure compliance.
For example,
there are no mandatory reporting requirements for the purpose or conditions of transportation.
Additionally,
the rules do not mandate independent audits or inspections to verify the welfare of elephants during and after transportation.
lack of oversight leaves room for exploitation
, as private owners can easily evade scrutiny.
Furthermore, the absence of penalties for violations undermines the effectiveness of the rules, allowing unethical practices to continue unchecked.
Loopholes That Undermine Conservation: Cross-State Trade and Legislative Gaps
Instances of elephants being "gifted" or sold across states highlight how the 2024 rules facilitate,
rather than curb, such transactions.
notable example involves elephants being transported from northeastern states to southern and western regions
under the guise of religious or ceremonial needs.
In response to public outcry,
the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) issued a memorandum in August 2024
emphasising stricter adherence to the Captive Elephant Rules and the digitization of genetic profiles of captive elephants.
While this is a step in the right direction, it falls short of addressing the deeper issues
in the legislation.
rules’ permissiveness regarding ownership transfers and transportation risks creating demand
for new captive elephants.
This, in turn,
fuels the illegal capture of wild elephants, directly contradicting conservation goals.
Despite the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, prohibiting the capture of wild elephants, the 2024
rules inadvertently enable this practice
by providing a legal pathway for laundered elephants to enter private ownership.
Recommendations for Addressing the Flaws
Prohibition of Commercial Transfers
: Explicitly banning the sale, trade, or leasing of elephants as part of ownership transfers
to ensure that elephants are not treated as commodities
Mandatory Justification for Transportation
: Requiring detailed documentation and prior approval for any transportation of elephants, including a clear explanation of the necessity and proof of welfare considerations.
Stricter Oversight Mechanisms
: Introducing regular inspections by independent authorities and mandatory reporting of transportation details to
ensure compliance with welfare standards.
Harsh Penalties for Non-Compliance
: Establishing stringent penalties for violations, such as illegal transfers or failure to adhere to welfare guidelines
, to deter unethical practices.
Public Awareness and Alternatives
: Promoting awareness about the ethical implications of using live elephants for religious and cultural activities,
while encouraging the adoption of alternatives like robotic or lifelike models.
Conclusion
The paradox of elephants being simultaneously venerated as sacred and exploited
reflects a troubling dissonance in societal values.
Without stringent measures
to protect their welfare and eliminate avenues for commercial exploitation,
this contradiction will persist.
Humane practices, robust legislative reforms, and public awareness are essential
to ensuring the meaningful protection of these majestic creatures.
Only by aligning cultural reverence with ethical responsibility can India truly honour its sacred symbol
of wisdom and strength.

**********Reversal of Declining Food Expenditure Trends in 2023-24
Why in News?
The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (
HCES
) 2023-24 provides crucial insights into consumption patterns, inequality, and regional variations.
The report highlights
a significant reversal in the decade-long decline in the share of food expenditure in both rural and urban households.
India’s average household consumption spending on a per capita basis rose about 3.5% in real terms through August 2023 to July 2024 from a year ago.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is HCES?
Highlights of the HCES 2023-24
Income Distribution and Spending Trends
Sectoral and State-Wise Breakdown of Expenditure
Conclusion
Released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (
MoSPI
), HCES is
designed to collect information on consumption and expenditure
of the households on
goods and services
The survey provides data required to assess
trends in economic well-being
and to determine and update the basket of consumer goods and services and weights used for the calculation of the Consumer Price Index.
Data collected in HCES is also used to
measure poverty, inequality, and social exclusion
The Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (
MPCE
) compiled from HCES is the
primary indicator
used for most analytical purposes.
The estimates of MPCE of 2023-24 are based on the data collected from 2,61,953 households (1,54,357 in rural areas and 1,07,596 in urban areas) in the central sample spread
over all States and UTs
in the country.
Highlights of the HCES 2023-24:
Rising food expenditure:
Rural households:
The share of food expenditure increased to 47.04% in 2023-24 from 46.38% in 2022-23.
Urban households:
A slight rise to 39.68% in 2023-24 from 39.17% in the previous year.
Significance of this trend:
This trend
reflects the impact of higher food prices
, as the figures are in nominal terms.
Urban-rural expenditure gap:
The difference in average monthly consumption expenditure between rural and urban households
narrowed
to 69.7% in 2023-24 from 71.2% in 2022-23.
The gap has consistently reduced over the last decade,
indicating stronger growth in rural consumption spending.
Average monthly consumption expenditure (MPCE):
Rural areas:
MPCE increased by 9.3% to Rs 4,122 in 2023-24 from Rs 3,773 in 2022-23.
Urban areas:
MPCE rose to Rs 6,996, up from Rs 6,459 in the previous year.
Historical context:
MPCE in 2011-12 was Rs 1,430 (rural) and Rs 2,630 (urban), showing significant growth over the years.
Imputed consumption:
Including social welfare benefits, MPCE was Rs 4,247 (rural) and Rs 7,078 (urban) in 2023-24.
Income Distribution and Spending Trends:
Top 5%:
Decline in MPCE for the top 5% of rural (Rs 10,137) and urban (Rs 20,310) households compared to 2022-23.
Bottom 5%:
Significant increase in MPCE for rural (Rs 1,677) and urban (Rs 2,376) households.
Bottom 20%:
Highest percentage growth in spending - 19.2% (rural) and 18% (urban).
Top 20%:
Marginal growth of 1.5% (rural) and 1.1% (urban).
Consumption inequality:
Gini coefficient,
a measure of inequality, declined:
From 0.266 in 2022-23 to 0.237 in 2023-24.
From 0.314 to 0.284.
This indicates
reduced consumption inequality
across both rural and urban households.
Sectoral and State-Wise Breakdown of Expenditure:
Sectoral:
Food items:
Cereals:
Share increased slightly for both rural (4.99%) and urban (3.76%) households.
Beverages and processed foods:
Highest share at 9.84% (rural) and 11.09% (urban).
Non-food items:
Rural:
52.96% of expenditure, driven by conveyance, medical expenses, and clothing.

**********RBI sets up panel for ethical AI use
Why in news?
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has established an eight-member committee to create a
Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of Artificial Intelligence (FREE-AI)
in the financial sector.
Headed by Pushpak Bhattacharyya (IIT Bombay), this panel will assess the adoption of AI in financial services globally and in India, review regulatory approaches, identify risks, and recommend governance and compliance frameworks for ethical AI adoption.
RBI's fintech department will support the committee, which is expected to submit its report within six months.
What’s in today’s article?
Ethical Use of AI in the Financial Sector
Background
The integration of AI in the financial sector has revolutionized how institutions operate, offering benefits such as improved efficiency, better decision-making, and enhanced customer experiences.
However, the ethical use of AI is crucial to ensuring trust, fairness, and compliance with regulatory standards.
Need for ethical use of AI in the financial sector
Fairness and Non-Discrimination
AI systems used for credit scoring, loan approvals, and fraud detection must avoid biases based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.
For instance, a biased algorithm that unfairly denies loans to certain groups can lead to legal and reputational risks.
Hence, a bank using AI for loan approval must ensure that its training data is balanced and does not perpetuate historical biases.
Transparency and Explainability
Financial institutions must ensure AI systems are explainable to customers and regulators.
Transparency builds trust and allows users to understand why decisions, such as loan rejections or credit score changes, were made.
E.g., an AI-based robo-advisor provides clear justifications for investment recommendations instead of relying solely on opaque algorithms.
Data Privacy and Security
Financial firms handle sensitive customer data, making privacy and security paramount.
AI models should comply with data protection regulations like GDPR or India's Data Protection Act to safeguard consumer information.
Hence, AI-driven fraud detection systems use anonymized datasets to detect suspicious transactions without compromising customer identities.
Accountability and Oversight
Organizations must ensure human oversight of AI systems to address errors, malfunctions, or ethical concerns.
Automated systems cannot operate without periodic audits and accountability measures.
Avoiding Over-Reliance on Automation
While AI enhances efficiency, complete reliance on automation can be risky. Institutions should blend AI with human judgment to make well-rounded decisions, especially in complex scenarios.
Hence, a system is needed where AI flags potential investment risks, but final decisions are reviewed by financial experts.
Steps Taken by India to Promote Ethical Use of AI in the Financial Sector
Formation of RBI’s FREE-AI Committee
Regulatory Sandbox Initiatives
The RBI has introduced regulatory sandboxes to encourage innovation while ensuring ethical practices in the financial sector.
AI and Machine Learning (ML) are core areas under these sandboxes, providing a controlled environment to test AI solutions while addressing risks like bias, security, and transparency.
Guidelines on Data Privacy and Security
India's Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (PDP Act) ensures financial institutions using AI adhere to strict data protection regulations.
Mulehunter. ai
RBI has developed an AI/ML-based model called MuleHunter. ai to tackle the issue of mule accounts, which are used for financial fraud.
These accounts help criminals launder money from cybercrimes.
National Strategy on AI (NSAI)
The Government of India, through NITI Aayog, has introduced the NSAI, emphasizing responsible AI use across sectors, including finance.
Conclusion
Ethical use of AI in the financial sector ensures innovation does not come at the cost of fairness, transparency, or security.
By adhering to these principles and leveraging AI responsibly, financial institutions can maintain trust and deliver sustainable benefits to society.

**********Should the wealth tax be reinstated in India?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Wealth tax;
Why in the News?
At a New Delhi panel, economist Thomas Piketty proposed taxing India’s super-rich to fund health and education, while Chief Economic Advisor Anantha Nageswaran cautioned against potential fund outflows from higher taxes.
What are the potential benefits of reinstating a wealth tax?
Funding Public Services:
A wealth tax could provide significant revenue that could be allocated to critical sectors such as health and education, addressing inequalities in access to these services. This funding could help create a more educated and healthier workforce, ultimately benefiting the economy.
Addressing Wealth Inequality:
With wealth concentration at historically high levels, a wealth tax could serve as a tool to mitigate inequality, which is increasingly viewed as a fundamental development issue that affects opportunities for many individuals.
Encouraging Productive Investments:
By taxing unproductive assets like real estate and gold while promoting investments in productive assets such as equities and bonds, a wealth tax could potentially shift capital towards more economically beneficial uses.
What challenges and criticisms exist regarding the implementation of a wealth tax?
Measurement Difficulties:
Accurately measuring wealth poses significant challenges. The complexities of defining what constitutes wealth and ownership can lead to loopholes and evasion, as individuals may shift their assets to avoid taxation.
Capital Flight Concerns:
There is apprehension that high taxation on the wealthy could lead to capital outflows, as individuals may relocate their assets or themselves to countries with lower tax burdens. This concern is particularly pronounced in India, where the public infrastructure may not be sufficient to retain high-net-worth individuals.
Historical Ineffectiveness:
Previous implementations of wealth tax in India resulted in low collection rates (less than 1% of gross tax collections). The high cost of collection and the challenges of enforcement contributed to its abolishment in 2016-17.
Misallocation of Resources:
Critics argue that simply imposing a wealth tax does not guarantee effective use of the revenue generated. There are concerns about whether additional funds would improve sectors like education, which already face management inefficiencies.
How would a wealth tax impact India’s economy and social structure?
Economic Growth vs. Redistribution:
Proponents argue that addressing inequality through a wealth tax can enhance overall economic growth by expanding opportunities for disadvantaged groups.
However, opponents maintain that focusing on growth alone is more beneficial, suggesting that redistribution efforts may not lead to improved outcomes for the economy.
Social Cohesion:
A wealth tax could potentially foster greater social cohesion by addressing stark disparities in wealth and opportunity.
However, if perceived as punitive or ineffective, it might exacerbate tensions between different socioeconomic groups.
Investment Climate:
A wealth tax could change how people invest in India. Some investors might hesitate because of higher costs, but if the money is used well for public services. It could improve living standards and infrastructure, making India a better place for investment over time.
Case study:
Norway is often cited as a successful case study for wealth tax implementation. Norway imposes a wealth tax on individuals with a net worth exceeding a certain threshold, which includes various asset classes such as real estate, stocks, and bonds.
For 2022, a new step for the state rate is introduced. For net wealth in excess of NOK 20 million (NOK 40 million for married couples), the rate is 0.4%. Thus, the maximum wealth tax rate is 1.1%.
Way forward:
Efficient Tax Design and Implementation
: Develop a clear and transparent framework for wealth taxation to minimize evasion, ensure equitable enforcement, and balance revenue generation with economic growth.
Focus on Public Infrastructure
: Prioritize effective allocation of tax revenue to critical sectors like health and education, addressing inefficiencies to build trust and maximize social and economic benefits.
Mains question for practice:

**********Rules that still manacle the captive elephant
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Wildlife protection;
Why in the News?
The Captive Elephant (Transfer or Transport) Rules contain ambiguities that could enable the illegal trade of elephants.
What are the current welfare standards for captive elephants?
Legal Framework:
Elephants are protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972, but enforcement is weak.
The Kerala High Court has issued directions to ensure compliance with the Kerala Captive Elephants (Management and Maintenance) Rules, 2012, yet many elephants lack proper ownership documentation, indicating illegal possession.
Exploitation for Commercial Gain:
Captive elephants are often used in religious festivals and tourism, which the Kerala High Court described as “commercial exploitation” devoid of concern for their well-being.
This exploitation is exacerbated by the competitive nature of temple festivals where the number of elephants paraded is prioritized over their welfare.
Physical and Psychological Impact:
Captive elephants endure harsh conditions, including inadequate diets, lack of proper medical care, and exposure to stressful environments during festivals.
Mortality rates among captive elephants due to these factors is approximately 33% of recorded captive elephants in Kerala died between 2018 and 2024.
What are the Kerala Captive Elephants (Management and Maintenance) Rules, 2012?
The rules for captive elephants mandate age-based definitions, housing space standards, nutritional requirements (e.g., 250 kg fodder for adults), regular health monitoring, and restrictions on using elephants in the musth.
A management committee oversees implementation, ensuring welfare through multi-department collaboration, including forestry, veterinary, and animal welfare representatives.
What are the ambiguities in the Captive Elephant (Transfer or Transport) Rules?
The Captive Elephant (Transfer or Transport) Rules, 2024, introduced by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), aim to regulate the movement of captive elephants within and between states in India. However, these rules contain several ambiguities that raise concerns among animal rights activists and experts regarding their potential misuse
Ambiguity in Transfer Rules
: Vague criteria for elephant transfers, such as inadequate care or potential for better maintenance, risk enabling unauthorized sales disguised as legitimate transactions.
Ownership Transfer Oversight
: Shifting application responsibility to the deputy conservator of forests, instead of the CWW, weakens protections and facilitates improper transfers, potentially treating elephants as movable assets.
Transport Justification Gap
: The absence of a requirement to justify temporary interstate transport allows leasing or renting of elephants, further commodifying and jeopardizing their welfare.
Weak Genetic Profiling
: Despite mandates for recording genetic profiles, lax monitoring can enable illegal captures to be misrepresented as legitimate ownership.
Database Deficiency
: The lack of a national database tracking ownership and genetic details of captive elephants hampers regulation and increases the risk of illegal transfers.
Inadequate Exploitation Safeguards
: The rules fail to sufficiently prevent the commercial use of elephants in religious events or entertainment, incentivizing wild captures under false pretences.
How do captivity conditions affect the physical and psychological well-being of elephants?
Physical Health:
Elephants in captivity often suffer from malnutrition due to a poor diet that lacks the variety available in the wild. For instance, some are only fed glucose-rich fodder instead of a balanced diet.
Psychological Well-being:
The social nature of elephants means that isolation and abusive training methods can lead to severe psychological distress. The use of capture belts and other coercive training devices has been criticized for causing both physical and emotional harm.
High Incidence of Distress:
Anecdotal evidence suggests that captive elephants frequently exhibit signs of distress, including aggressive behavior or attempts to escape, which can endanger both themselves and surrounding humans.
What reforms are necessary to improve the management and care of captive elephants? (Way forward)
Strengthening Regulation:
There is a need for clearer regulations to prevent the commercial exploitation of elephants. The current rules allow for ownership transfers without prohibiting commercial transactions, which could facilitate illegal wildlife trade.
Implementation of Humane Practices:
Mandating humane birth control measures and prohibiting the use of live elephants in entertainment could help reduce the number entering captivity.
Alternatives like electronic simulations could replace live elephants in religious ceremonies.
Monitoring and Accountability:
The rules should require post-mortem examinations for deceased elephants during transfers to ensure accountability.
Stakeholder Engagement:
Collaborative efforts involving civil society, government bodies, and NGOs are essential to develop comprehensive guidelines that prioritize elephant welfare over commercial interests.
Mains question for practice:
Q
Discuss the ambiguities in the
