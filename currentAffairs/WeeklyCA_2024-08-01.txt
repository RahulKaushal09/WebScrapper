Expansion of Financial Services
: The evolution and adoption of technological advancements have led to
massive improvement
in deepening of digital financial services.
The potential for expanding financial inclusion in India by application of digital technologies is high in view of existing conditions.
First, the progress of financial inclusion in India is evident in the Reserve Bank’s
Financial Inclusion Index
and narrowing account access gap between income groups.
Second, in
rural India, 46% of the population consists of wireless phone
subscribers and 54% are active internet users.
Third, given that more than half of FinTech consumers are from semi-urban and rural India and
more than a third of digital payment users are from rural areas
there is potential for furthering digital penetration and closing the rural-urban gap.
Over two lakh gram panchayats
have been connected through
BharatNet
in the last decade, enabling provision of services like e-health, e-education and e-governance in rural areas.
Mobile Penetration
: Although internet penetration in India was at 55% in 2023, the internet user base has grown by 199 million in the recent three years.
India’s cost per gigabyte (GB) of data
consumed is the
lowest globally
at an average of Rs. 13.32 per GB.
India also has
one of the highest mobile data consumption
in the world, with an
average per-user per-month consumption of 24.1 GB in 2023.
There are
about 750 million smartphone users
, which is expected to reach about one billion by 2026.
India is expected to be the
second largest smartphone manufacturer
in the next five years.

Digital Economy:
The digital economy currently
accounts for 10% of India's GDP.
By 2026,
this figure is expected to double, contributing to 20% of GDP,
driven by rapid advancements in
digital infrastructure
and financial technology.
Digitization is
strengthening banking infrastructure
and public finance systems, optimizing direct benefit transfers and tax collections.
India Stack
: Key components such as
Aadhaar
Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
DigiLocker
have revolutionised service delivery. UPI has seen a tenfold increase in transactions over four years.
: The world's
largest biometric-based identification system
, covering 1.38 billion ID holders.
: A real-time, low-cost transaction platform contributing significantly to financial inclusion.
: Cloud-based storage providing secure document access.

Internationalisation of
Digital Public Infrastructure
: India’s DPI is going global by:
Collaborating with other nations to develop digital identity solutions under the
Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) programme.
Interlinkage of the UPI with fast payment systems of other nations like Singapore’s PayNow, the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) Instant Pay Platform (IPP) and Nepal’s National Payments Interface (NPI) for
cost-effective and fast
remittances.
Partnering with other central banks and foreign payment service providers to
broaden
RuPay
acceptance
beyond geographical borders, such as in countries like Bhutan, Mauritius, Singapore and the UAE.
Sharing the
Beckn protocol with nations
to provide their public and private services through open, lightweight and decentralised specifications.
Beckn Protocol
enables the creation of open
, peer-to-peer decentralized networks for pan-sector economic transactions.

Vibrant Initiatives:
Open Credit Enablement Network,
Open Network for Digital Commerce, and the Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit are driving the digital lending ecosystem.
Fintech companies are partnering with
non-banking financial companies (NBFCs)
to offer digital credit solutions and enhance financial inclusion.
What are the Challenges Posed by Digitalisation?
Impact on Financial Markets:
Digitalisation has led to the
introduction of complex financial products
and services, significantly impacting market structure and financial stability.
The emergence of digital players with unreliable funding models
increases system vulnerabilities
and poses challenges to financial stability.
hyper-diversification
of financial services may result in a
"barbell" financial structure
, where a
few dominant multi-product players coexist
with numerous niche service providers.
Fear of Monopolisation:
In India's
digital payment ecosystem
proliferation of Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
applications has expanded customer choices and increased transaction volumes. However, a significant share of transactions is dominated by a few applications, as indicated by the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
(a common
measure of market concentration
of an industry used to
determine market competitiveness
).
To address concentration risks, the
National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)
has capped the market share of a
single third-party application provider
to 30% by December 2024.
Cyber Security Challenges:
Cybersecurity
is a major concern due to the diverse nature of
cyber threats
targeting digital financial infrastructure.
In India, security incidents handled by the Indian
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)
have skyrocketed from 53,117 in 2017 to over 1.32 million between January and October 2023.
The majority of these incidents
involve unauthorized network scanning
, probing, and exploitation of vulnerable services.
In India, the average cost of a data breach in 2023 was USD 2.18 million, which is less than the global average but still represents a significant increase.
Consumer Protection Issues:
Digitalisation has also led to
dark patterns
,"
where consumers are tricked into making decisions against their interests. Additionally,
extensive use of customer data
by companies raises concerns about data protection and privacy, potentially compromising customer trust.

Reshaping Labour Markets:
Digital technologies are
transforming workforce composition
, job quality, skill requirements, and labour policies. The implementation of AI in financial services shifts roles towards higher-skilled tasks, automating routine functions and aiding decision-making.
Between 2013 and 2019, support roles in the financial sector declined, while the number of professionals and technicians increased.
private sector banks
reported high turnover rates in 2022-23, leading to significant risks such as loss of
institutional knowledge
and higher recruitment costs.
What Steps Have Been Taken to Deal With the Challenges?
Financial and Digital Inclusion:
India has established
Digital Banking Units (DBUs)
and improved UPI with
offline and conversational payments
in local languages.
Payment Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF)
has been launched to broaden payment infrastructure, and digitalisation of agricultural finance is underway.
Customer Protection:
To address regulatory and customer protection challenges in the digital lending ecosystem, the RBI issued the
Guidelines on Digital Lending
, focusing on loan servicing, disclosures, grievance redressal, credit assessment standards, and data privacy.
Reserve Bank-Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS)
has improved grievance redress mechanisms, and public awareness campaigns like
‘RBI Kehta Hai’
e-BAAT programme
educate the public on digital payment products and fraud prevention.
Data Protection:
The RBI has implemented data localisation for payments data and guidelines preventing
digital lending applications
from accessing private information without explicit user consent.
Card-on-file tokenisation (CoFT)
through card-issuing banks has been enabled to enhance the security of digital payments.
Cyber Security:
To promote the security of digital transactions, measures such as
two-factor authentication, increased customer control over card usage,
faster turnaround times for transaction failures, and augmented supervisory oversight have been implemented.
The RBI has issued comprehensive guidelines for
IT and Cyber Risk management.
FinTech Regulation:
The RBI has launched the
Regulatory Sandbox scheme
, the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub, and FinTech Hackathons to encourage FinTech innovations.
Digital Technologies in Regulation and Supervision:
Digital tools are being leveraged to enhance supervisory and monitoring frameworks. The
DAKSH system
help digitalise supervisory processes.
Integrated Compliance Management and Tracking System (ICMTS)
and Centralised Information Management System (CIMS) are also being implemented to enhance data management and analytics capabilities.
Drishti Mains Question:
Discuss the major challenges associated with the digitalisation of the Indian economy. How can these challenges be effectively addressed to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth?
