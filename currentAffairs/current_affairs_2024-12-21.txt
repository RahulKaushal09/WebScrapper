THE BRIDGE TO MOSCOW
Syllabus:
Mains – GS 2
Context:
India-Russia relationship is set to be the most consequential bilateral engagement of the year 2025.
Background: –
The India-Russia relationship serves not just the two countries in question, but the world.
Key takeaways
The strength of ties between New Delhi and Moscow matters to both countries. It touches core mutual areas: Trade in energy, technological co-development, and strategic interests.
Russia remains India’s most accommodating partner when it comes to high-tech supplies. While the West — France and the US in particular — are relaxing rules for trade with India in dual-use tech, there is still a long way to go before Delhi’s undersea and long-range requirements are satisfied by the West. This is where Moscow steps in.
Apart from being mutually beneficial to India and Russia, the relationship is a vital global public good :
First, it serves as a bridge between the rest of the world and a Russian polity that has been alienated by, and has set out to further alienate, the West. India’s commitment to multilateralism and the global order anchors Russia, to a system that it otherwise seeks to disrupt.
Second, the India-Russia relationship prevents the Russian bear from totally entering the dragon’s den. A Russia locked into servitude to Beijing’s interests would be profoundly inimical for the world order, the West in particular. India’s outstretched hand grants Russia the ability to manoeuvre and allows it to avoid capitulating completely to China.
Third, trade between India and Russia in fossil fuels is designed to be compliant with sanctions meant to limit Russian profits. This too provides broader benefits to the world. It brings valuable price stability and predictability to energy markets, which is vital for the West and for Europe in particular.
Fourth, the relationship allows for new possibilities in the crucial Arctic region. Without India’s increasing strategic presence in the Arctic, in partnership not just with Russia but also with European and Nordic friends, a new Russia-China axis would have shaped the region’s future. This would have spelt disaster for the ecology and security of global supply chains.
Finally, India’s presence in groupings like BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ensures that these are not weaponised against the West. As External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has put it, India is non-Western, it is not anti-Western. This moderate and reasonable attitude shapes the actions and positions of such groupings. The entry of New Delhi’s candidates — and Western friends — such as the UAE, Egypt and Vietnam into BRICS as either members or partners has further moderated that grouping.
The ability to partner with nations that are deeply divided by geopolitics has been a feature of Indian diplomacy since Independence. The India-Russia relationship serves not just the two countries in question, but the world.

STARLINK SATELLITE INTERNET
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Elon Musk has denied claims that his space company SpaceX’s satellite internet technology Starlink is being used by militants in Manipur.
This came after the Indian Army and police seized weapons and what looked like a Starlink-branded satellite router and antenna. Starlink is still pending regulatory approval in India, though it will be starting in neighbouring Bangladesh and Bhutan in 2025
What is Starlink and how does it work?
Starlink uses an extensive low Earth orbit satellite constellation to deliver broadband internet that has high speeds and low latency.
It is a popular choice for users worldwide in remote areas, sea vessels, disaster-struck regions, or places where oppressive regimes have throttled access to more mainstream internet services.
There are thousands of satellites in the Starlink system, and they orbit Earth at around 550 km. Though they cover the entire globe, per SpaceX, the company is not authorised to provide its services to users in some regions.
What is the controversy surrounding Starlink?
Indian army on December 16 shared photos of guns, ammunition, and country-made mortars seized from Manipur in X.
X users spotted a small satellite device and router, with the latter bearing the SpaceX logo sparkling speculation that Musk’s technology was being used by terrorists. Elon Muk responded that Starlink satellite beams are turned off over India.
This is not the first time SpaceX has become embroiled in controversy in India. Last month, smugglers originating from Myanmar were caught by the Andaman and Nicobar islands police with over 6,000 kg of meth and a Starlink device that was allegedly used for navigation and communication, despite service being prohibited in Indian waters.
Furthermore, in August this year, Starlink equipment was seen being sold on the B2B platform IndiaMART.
Can Starlink satellite internet be controlled ?
International borders are not solid and it is not easy to refine satellite internet coverage to such a precise degree that service is activated or halted exactly in line with a nation’s border. An additional complication is that many international borders are contested or unclear
More information is needed from SpaceX to understand how the company ensures that Starlink satellite internet does not reach the countries yet to allow Starlink, while enabling service for neighbouring countries or waters that do allow Starlink service.
What does Indian law say?
India strictly regulates and restricts the use of satellite-based communication devices. Everyday gadget users within the country would have noticed that even key satellite-based emergency features on premium phones that are easily available for users overseas are not enabled for use in India.
Under section 6 of the Indian Wireless Act and Section 20 of the Indian Telegraph Act, the use of thuraya/iridium satellite phones is illegal in the country. Indian embassies worldwide warn both Indian and foreign travellers that they cannot carry satellite phones into the country and may face confiscation and legal action if they do so without permission.
These restrictions are in place largely to combat militancy and terrorism. In 2022, Indian officials reported that evidence of iridium satellite phone usage was discovered in the Kashmir Valley.
Starlink is currently trying to enter the Indian market. The latest discovery of the Starlink hardware in Manipur could further affect SpaceX’s entry, due to doubts over its compliance with Indian regulations and possible misuse by non-state actors.

**********Higher GST on Tobacco Can Improve Societal Health
Context
The
recent proposals by the Group of Ministers (GoM) under India’s GST Council reflect a common-sense
approach to taxation, emphasising national priorities of public health and equity.
These
reforms aim to recalibrate the country’s tax structure by lowering GST rates on essential items like bicycles and exercise books
while increasing taxes on high-value luxury goods, including tobacco products.
This
dual strategy not only prioritises the well-being of citizens but also addresses the broader societal costs associated with preventable health crises
, particularly those arising from tobacco consumption.
The Burden of Tobacco Consumption
Tobacco usage in India is a
public health crisis of staggering proportions.
Killing nearly 1.3 million people annually and debilitating millions more, tobacco exacts enormous societal costs
in terms of lost productivity and escalating healthcare expenses.
These stark realities underscore the urgent need for effective policy interventions
. Among these, taxation stands out as the single most effective measure to curb tobacco use.
By increasing prices through higher taxes, governments can discourage new users,
encourage current users to quit, and prevent relapse among former users.
Benefits of High Taxation on Tobacco Products
Impact on Consumption Patterns
One of the key advantages of taxing tobacco is its
ability to influence consumer behaviour, particularly among price-sensitive groups
such as lower-income populations and young people.
When taxes are raised, the cost of tobacco products increases,
prompting consumers to rethink their consumption habits.
Studies consistently show that
higher tobacco prices discourage people from starting to smoke,
encourage current smokers to quit, and reduce overall consumption levels.
price sensitivity is more pronounced among economically disadvantaged groups
, who spend a larger proportion of their income on tobacco.
As a result,
higher taxes are more likely to lead to significant reductions in tobacco use among these populations,
creating a disproportionately positive impact on their health.
Generating Revenue for Public Welfare
Beyond reducing consumption,
tobacco taxation generates substantial revenue for governments.
paradox of tobacco taxation lies in its elasticity
: while higher prices lead to reduced consumption, the decline is typically less than proportional to the tax increase.
means that governments can collect more revenue even as fewer tobacco products are sold.
additional funds generated can be strategically reinvested in public goods and services,
amplifying their societal impact.
For example, revenues from tobacco taxes can be directed toward strengthening healthcare infrastructure,
funding education programs, or supporting anti-smoking campaigns.
investments create a virtuous cycle
, where the benefits of reduced tobacco use extend beyond individual health to broader societal gains.
Addressing Inequities through Taxation
Tobacco taxes are inherently progressive when designed thoughtfully.
Lower-income individuals, who are more sensitive to price increases, benefit the most from reduced consumption
and the associated health improvements.
effect helps to mitigate health disparities
, as economically disadvantaged groups are often disproportionately affected by tobacco-related illnesses.
Furthermore,
the reinvestment of tobacco tax revenues into public welfare programs can enhance social equity.
For instance,
funding universal healthcare initiatives or subsidising health insurance premiums with tobacco tax revenues ensures that the benefits are distributed widely,
including to those who need them the most.
Limitations of India’s Current Tobacco Tax Structure and Measures to Address These Challenges
Tiered Tax Structure: A Barrier to Effectiveness
One of the most pressing issues in India’s tobacco tax system is its tiered structure, where
different types of tobacco products, and even brands within a category, are taxed at varying rates.
cigarettes may be taxed higher than bidis, and premium cigarette brands often face higher rates
than lower-cost alternatives.
disparity creates a loophole for consumers
to switch to cheaper options when prices rise for one category or brand.
The tiered structure diminishes the deterrent effect of taxation
by making it possible for users to maintain their consumption levels through substitution.
Bidis, in particular, are taxed minimally or not at all in some cases
, despite being a major source of tobacco use in India.
This not only perpetuates widespread bidi consumption but also results in significant revenue losses
for the government.
To address this,
India needs a unified tax structure where the same rate is applied per unit of tobacco, regardless of brand, size, or other characteristics.
A consistent and simplified system eliminates substitution opportunities and ensures that all tobacco products are equally disincentivized.
Affordability of Tobacco Products
Despite periodic tax increases, many tobacco products in India remain highly affordable.
Between 2016 and 2022, cigarettes, bidis, and chewing tobacco products became more affordable on average
, largely due to the combination of stagnant tax rates and rising incomes.
As tobacco products become more affordable, their consumption increases
, counteracting public health efforts.
To tackle this issue,
taxes must be adjusted annually to account for inflation and income growth.
Specific excise taxes,
rather than ad valorem taxes (which are a percentage of the price), are
particularly effective in this context.
Specific excise taxes impose a fixed amount per unit of tobacco, ensuring that prices rise predictably and significantly over time.
This approach reduces affordability and maintains the deterrent effect of taxation.
The Problem of Lower Taxation on Bidis
Bidis, a traditional form of smoked tobacco,
pose a unique challenge in India’s tobacco control efforts.
They are
consumed predominantly by low-income groups
and are often seen as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes.
However,
bidis are equally, if not more, harmful to health, and
their minimal taxation exacerbates their widespread use.
the government must consider comprehensive taxation and regulation of bidis.
Bringing bidis under the same tax framework as other tobacco products would significantly reduce their affordability
and consumption.
Additionally
, targeted public health campaigns and alternative livelihood programs for bidi workers can help mitigate resistance
to such reforms.
Tax on Smokeless Tobacco Products
Smokeless tobacco products,
including chewing tobacco and gutka, are another area of concern.
These products are widely consumed across India and contribute significantly to the country’s tobacco-related disease burden.
Yet, their taxation and regulation remain inconsistent.
Including smokeless tobacco products in a unified tax structure and subjecting them to regular price increases would complement efforts
to reduce overall tobacco consumption.
Public awareness campaigns highlighting the health risks of smokeless tobacco can further reinforce these measures.
Conclusion
The GST Council’s proposed reforms represent a decisive step
toward balancing the nation’s fiscal and public health goals.
Higher taxes on tobacco products, coupled with reduced levies on essentials, reflect a thoughtful prioritisation
of societal well-being.
By aligning taxation policies with national health
and equity goals,
India can pave the way for a healthier, more productive, and equitable society.

**********Regulating Opinion Trading Platforms in India
Why in News?
With an estimated 5 crore users and an exponential growth in investment, the opinion trading sector appears to have mostly gone unnoticed and unreviewed in India.

Legal and Regulatory Challenges of Opinion Trading in India
Industry Perspective
Global Experience and Lessons for India
Way Ahead for Regulating Opinion Trading in India
Opinion trading
allows users to bet real money on the outcomes of future events
across various sectors, such as
sports, elections, and cryptocurrency
Popular platforms in India include
Probo and MPL Opinio
, which have collectively attracted over ₹4,200 crore in funding from major investors like Sequoia Capital and Y Combinator.
Apps like MPL Opinio are available on both
Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store
, while Probo is excluded from Google Play.
Advertising on platforms like Google and Meta helps
these companies acquire users.
With over
and transaction volumes exceeding
₹50,000 crore
annually, the sector is witnessing exponential growth but
remains largely unregulated.
It is projected to
generate over ₹1,000 crore in revenues
for the financial year 2024-25.
Despite the regulatory challenges, the industry’s rapid growth highlights its
potential as a significant contributor to India’s online gaming economy.
Legal and Regulatory Challenges of Opinion Trading in India:
Lack of central legislation:
India currently
lacks a dedicated legal framework
to regulate opinion trading platforms, leaving users without adequate protections.
Amendments to the Information Technology Rules
were proposed to regulate online gaming but remain ambiguous in their enforcement.
As a result, platforms operate in a legal gray area with limited oversight.
Game of skill vs. game of chance:
The legal status of opinion trading hinges on whether it is classified as a game of skill or chance. In India,
games of skill are generally legal
, while games of chance are not.
Critics argue that opinion trading
resembles betting
, as it involves wagering/betting on outcomes
without requiring significant skill
Avoidance of stock market topics:
To minimise regulatory scrutiny, platforms avoid questions related to the Indian stock market, which could invoke the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
Industry Perspective:
asserts that its platform involves
, using internal audits and Supreme Court-defined metrics to determine the "skill score" of its questions.
According to some legal experts,
The absence of a "house"
(an entity controlling outcomes) distinguishes opinion trading from traditional betting.
These platforms have drawn regulatory scrutiny, such as the
Competition Commission of India’s (CCI)
investigation into alleged market distortions.
Global Experience and Lessons for India:
Countries like the
US and Australia
, classify wagers/bets as securities and regulate them accordingly.
In the
, platforms like Kalshi are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (
CFTC
However, non-compliance with regulatory standards, as seen with Polymarket, can lead to legal action.
Way Ahead for Regulating Opinion Trading in India:
The rapid rise of opinion trading platforms underscores the
urgent need for a clear regulatory framework
Stakeholders, including platform founders and gaming industry representatives, have called for central laws to govern this sector.
A balanced approach
is essential to ensure
user protection while fostering innovation and growth in the burgeoning online gaming industry.

**********Takeaways from the India-SL recent engagement
Why in news?
The recent visit of Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) to India— his first trip overseas since becoming leader of his country — saw some classic diplomatic deal-making, with give and take on both sides.
What’s in today’s article?
Win Some, Lose Some: Key Takeaways from AKD's Visit to India
Confident President: Sri Lanka’s Evolving Stance and Domestic Actions
Focus on Mutual Benefits: India-Sri Lanka Cooperation
Assurance on Anti-India Activities
Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake (AKD) assured PM Modi that Sri Lanka’s territory would not be used for activities harmful to India’s interests.
This commitment addresses India’s concerns regarding the frequent visits of Chinese “research vessels” to Sri Lankan ports.
The reiteration of this stance is significant, as AKD is perceived to be pro-China.
Tamil Minority Issue: Divergent Views
AKD resisted India’s push for the full implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, which aims to empower the Tamil minority.
He opposes the amendment and investigations into alleged war crimes from the LTTE-Sri Lankan military conflict.
PM Modi emphasized “reconciliation and reconstruction” and urged Sri Lanka to fulfil its constitutional commitments and hold provincial council elections.
Focus on Unity and Development
While AKD avoided specific commitments on the Tamil issue, he emphasized unity, social protection, and sustainable development.
He highlighted the importance of diversity as a fundamental principle of democracy.
Firm Position on Tamil Issue
The joint statement reflected
Sri Lanka’s influence in shaping the narrative
Earlier, India had emphasized Tamil aspirations and the need for the 13th Amendment's full implementation, along with provincial council elections.
However, AKD’s confidence, stemming from his strong parliamentary mandate, has enabled him to resist external pressure, including from India.
Confident Engagement with Major Powers
AKD’s historic parliamentary majority has bolstered his confidence in dealing with influential nations like India and China.
This self-assurance marks a shift in Sri Lanka’s diplomatic posture, signaling a more assertive and independent approach.
Anti-Corruption Commitment at Home
The President’s adherence to the principles of the “Clean Sri Lanka” campaign has been evident in domestic politics.
For instance, Speaker Asoka Ranwala, a close ally of AKD, was forced to step down amid allegations about his academic qualifications, demonstrating AKD’s zero-tolerance policy toward impropriety.
Rebuilding Sri Lanka with Focus and Clarity
President AKD is pursuing an ambitious agenda to rebuild Sri Lanka after recent crises.
The India-Sri Lanka joint statement, titled
“Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future,”
underscores this shared focus on development and collaboration.
Bilateral Cooperation
Digital collaboration includes implementing Aadhaar and UPI systems in Sri Lanka.
Both leaders acknowledged India’s significant contributions to Sri Lanka’s socioeconomic growth through
development assistance.
Key projects include:
Phase III & IV of the Indian Housing Project.
High Impact Community Development Projects.
Advancing Connectivity and Energy Cooperation
LNG supply.
Development of Trincomalee as a regional energy and industrial hub.
Offshore wind power development in the Palk Strait.
High-capacity power grid interconnection.
Three islands’ Hybrid Renewable Energy Project.
Enhancing Physical Connectivity
Resumption of passenger ferry services between:
Nagapattinam and Kankesanthurai.
Rameswaram and Talaimannar (under review).
Discussions on rehabilitating Sri Lanka’s Kankesanthurai port are underway.
Defence and Security Cooperation
Agreements to explore:
A framework Agreement on Defence Cooperation.
Provision of defence platforms and joint exercises.
Maritime surveillance, cyber security, and counter-terrorism under the Colombo Security Conclave mechanism.
Strategic Continuity Amid New Leadership
Despite new leadership in Sri Lanka, priorities and interests remain aligned.
India views Sri Lanka’s stability as critical to its strategic interests, while AKD seeks to make the next five years impactful through a mutually beneficial partnership.

**********Key takeaways from NEXUS report
Why in news?
The Assessment Report on the Interlinkages Among
Biodiversity, Water, Food, Health & Climate Change
– known as the
Nexus Report
– has been released by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
The report provides decision-makers with the most comprehensive scientific assessment of the interconnections across
five ‘nexus elements’.
It explores over 60 response options to maximize co-benefits across these five nexus elements.
What’s in today’s article?
The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)
Key highlights of the NEXUS Report
About
IPBES, akin to the IPCC for climate change, evaluates existing scientific knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystems to assess their current state.
Established in 2012
, it informs several international environmental agreements like the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the Ramsar Convention, and the Cartagena Protocol.
Just like IPCC,
IPBES too does not produce new science. It only evaluates the existing knowledge to make consolidated assessments
Landmark Report by IPBES
First Report (2019)
Highlighted threats to global biodiversity, revealing that one million species face extinction due to human-induced ecosystem changes.
It reported that 75% of Earth’s land, 66% of marine areas, and 85% of wetlands had been significantly altered or lost.
Impact
This report became the foundation for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (2022), which set 23 targets to halt biodiversity loss by 2030.
Key 2030 goals include: Protecting 30% of land, freshwater, and oceans; Restoring 30% of degraded ecosystems.
Strong interconnections between global challenges
The report highlights the strong interconnections between global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, hunger, water scarcity, and health risks.
It emphasizes that tackling these issues separately is not only ineffective but also counterproductive, as they interact and compound each other.
It noted that current economic activities significantly harm biodiversity, climate, food production, water, and health, with unaccounted costs estimated at $10-25 trillion annually.
Risks of Isolated Approaches
Food Production:
Scaling up to tackle hunger can increase pressure on land, water, and biodiversity.
Climate Change Focus:
Exclusive efforts could negatively affect food security and biodiversity.
Conservation:
Protecting land and oceans may restrict options for food security and climate change mitigation.
Call for Synergistic Approaches
The report advocates for integrated strategies that deliver benefits across all five challenges, identifying over 70 response options, including:
Restoring carbon-rich ecosystems like forests, soils, and mangroves.
Managing biodiversity to reduce zoonotic disease risks.
Promoting sustainable healthy diets.
Employing nature-based solutions.
Sustainable Production and Consumption
Efforts must prioritize actions that balance sustainable production and consumption with ecosystem conservation, pollution reduction, and climate change mitigation, ensuring broad and lasting benefits.
Economic Impact of Biodiversity Loss
The report highlights that over half of the global GDP, approximately $58 trillion annually, depends on nature.
Biodiversity degradation reduces productivity and economic output.
Despite this, current economic systems incentivize activities that harm biodiversity, contributing to its decline by 2–6% every decade.
Principles of Transformative Change
The report outlines four core principles for a new approach:
Equity and Justice:
Fair distribution of resources and opportunities.
Pluralism and Inclusion:
Embracing diverse perspectives.
Respectful Human-Nature Relationships:
Building reciprocal and sustainable interactions.
Adaptive Learning and Action:
Continuously evolving strategies based on feedback and experience.
Urgency and Benefits of Immediate Action
Delaying action on biodiversity conservation could double costs within a decade.
However, immediate implementation of sustainable, nature-positive models could unlock $10 trillion in business opportunities and create 400 million jobs by 2030.

**********Crimes against humanity and an obtuse Indian stance
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Crimes Against Humanity;
Why in the News?
India’s stance on a ‘crimes against humanity’ treaty reflects its longstanding reservations about the Rome Statute and the International Criminal Court.
What is India’s stance on the proposed Crimes Against Humanity treaty?
Non-Party to the Rome Statute:
India is
not a signatory to the Rome Statute
and has consistently expressed objections to the ICC’s jurisdiction, particularly regarding the powers of the ICC prosecutor and the role of the UN Security Council in prosecuting international crimes. India argues that it should be able to address such issues through its national legal system rather than through international mechanisms.
Call for In-Depth Study:
For 5 years, India has advocated for a comprehensive examination of the need for a dedicated CAH treaty. This reflects its belief that existing frameworks may not adequately address the complexities of CAH.
Concerns Over Duplication:
India is wary that a new CAH treaty could overlap with existing laws under the Rome Statute, potentially complicating accountability measures rather than clarifying them.
How does India’s legal framework address crimes against humanity?
Lack of Domestic Legislation:
Currently, India does not have specific domestic laws prohibiting crimes against humanity. The absence of such legislation was highlighted by
Justice S. Muralidhar of the Delhi High Court,
who noted that neither CAH nor genocide is included in India’s criminal law. This gap indicates a need for legislative action to align with international standards.
Emphasis on National Jurisdiction:
India maintains that national courts are more suitable for addressing CAH and other international crimes, emphasising its preference for national over international jurisdiction in these matters.
Why should India have proper legislation related to Crime against humanity?
Inadequate Domestic Legislation
: Despite ratifying the Genocide Convention, India lacks domestic laws to enforce its provisions, creating a gap in prosecuting crimes
like genocide and CAH.
International Accountability
: Enacting CAH laws would align India’s legal framework with international standards, fulfilling commitments and enhancing global cooperation on prosecuting international crimes.
Justice for Mass Atrocities
: India’s history of communal violence underscores the need for CAH laws to ensure justice, accountability, and deterrence against future atrocities while safeguarding human rights.
Leadership in Human Rights
: By adopting CAH laws, India could address global issues like terrorism, advocate for accountability, and position itself as a leader in promoting justice and human dignity.
Empowering National Courts
: CAH laws would strengthen Indian courts’ ability to handle serious human rights violations, reinforcing the country’s preference for national jurisdiction over international mechanisms.
What are India’s specific concerns regarding the definitions and scope of crimes against humanity?
Definition of Crimes:
India has raised objections to certain definitions within the proposed treaty. It argues against including “enforced disappearance” as a CAH while advocating for “terrorism” to be recognised as such. This reflects India’s broader security concerns and its focus on acts it deems more relevant to its national context.
Scope of Application:
India contends that crimes committed
only
during armed conflicts
should be classified as CAH, opposing any broader interpretation that includes
peacetime offences.
This position underscores India’s strategic interests and its approach to defining accountability in terms of state actions during conflicts rather than in peacetime contexts.
Way forward:
Enact Comprehensive Domestic Legislation
: India should introduce laws addressing crimes against humanity and other international crimes, aligning with global standards while addressing domestic concerns like terrorism and communal violence.
Advocate for Inclusive Global Frameworks
: India can engage constructively in international negotiations on the CAH treaty, pushing for definitions and provisions that address its concerns, such as including terrorism, while leveraging its stance to lead global efforts in promoting accountability and human rights.
Mains PYQ:
What do each of the following quotations mean to you? “Condemn none: if you can stretch out a helping hand, do so. If not, fold your hands, bless your brothers, and let them go their own way.” – Swami Vivekanand

**********The political crisis in South Korea
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India-South Korea relation;
Why in the News?
President Yoon Suk Yeol’s decision to declare martial law on December 3 caused a crisis, but the National Assembly rejected it. On December 14, he was impeached, leading to a long legal fight in South Korea’s Constitutional Court.
What Led to President Yoon Suk Yeol’s Declaration of Martial Law?
Political Frustration:
Facing increasing opposition and a loss of support from the National Assembly after the April 2024 elections, Yoon declared martial law on December 3, 2024, in a desperate attempt to maintain control amid growing dissent against his administration’s policies and allegations of corruption involving his wife.
Opposition Assertiveness:
The opposition parties gained significant power in the National Assembly, securing 192 out of 300 seats. Their assertive stance against Yoon’s government exacerbated tensions, prompting him to take extreme measures to suppress dissent.
Failed Military Response:
Despite sending military and police forces to various locations, including the National Assembly, their reluctance to act against peaceful protests highlighted the lack of support for Yoon’s decision. The National Assembly members voted overwhelmingly against martial law, leading to its withdrawal shortly after its declaration.
How Has the Political Landscape Changed Following the Impeachment Proceedings?
Increased Polarization:
The impeachment motion against Yoon, which passed with 204 votes in favour on December 14, 2024, reflects deepening political polarization in South Korea.
The ruling People Power Party (PPP) faced internal conflict over how to respond to the impeachment, indicating fractures within conservative ranks.
Opposition Power Dynamics:
The opposition has gained momentum and confidence following the successful impeachment motion. This shift has allowed them to challenge Yoon’s policies more aggressively and seek accountability for alleged corruption within his administration.
Public Sentiment:
Yoon’s popularity has plummeted due to his handling of both domestic and foreign policies, as well as controversies surrounding his wife. This decline has strengthened the opposition’s position and increased public demand for accountability.
What are the potential implications of this crisis for South Korea’s democratic institutions?
Erosion of Democratic Norms:
The use of martial law and aggressive tactics against political opponents raises concerns about the erosion of democratic norms in South Korea. Such actions could set a precedent for future administrations to bypass democratic processes in times of political strife.
Judicial Independence at Stake:
The ongoing impeachment proceedings will be reviewed by the Constitutional Court, which may face pressure from public opinion and political factions. The outcome could influence perceptions of judicial independence and integrity within South Korea’s legal system.
Long-Term Stability Concerns:
If political leaders continue to engage in vendetta politics and prioritize partisan interests over national unity, it could undermine public trust in democratic institutions. This instability may hinder effective governance and exacerbate societal divisions.
What are the challenges in India that could prevent a South Korea-like scenario?
Diverse Federal Structure
: India’s federal system and strong regional governments provide multiple centers of power, reducing the likelihood of concentrated national-level crises.
Robust Democratic Institutions
: A vibrant judiciary, free press, and active civil society act as checks against potential abuses of power.
Electoral Accountability
: Regular elections at various levels ensure political leaders remain answerable to the public, mitigating prolonged governance failures.
Cultural and Political Pluralism
: India’s diversity in culture, language, and political ideologies discourages the kind of national consensus required for large-scale systemic crises like in South Korea.
What should India do to prevent this type of situation? (Way forward)
Strengthen Democratic Institutions:
India should prioritize the independence and resilience of democratic institutions, including the judiciary, Election Commission, and a free press, to ensure checks and balances against potential overreach by any government.
Promote Political Accountability and Transparency:
Encourage bipartisan dialogue and accountability mechanisms to address corruption and governance issues, preventing political polarization and maintaining public trust in democratic processes.
Mains question for practice:
Q
Analyze the factors that led to the declaration of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol in South Korea and discuss its implications for democratic institutions. What lessons can India draw from this crisis to strengthen its own democratic framework?
