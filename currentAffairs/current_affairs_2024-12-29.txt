**********What is GPS Spoofing?
Instances of GPS interference on passenger aircraft, including ‘spoofing’ with false signals, are on the rise over conflict zones globally, including on India’s borders with Pakistan, a report from the OPSGROUP said recently.
About GPS Spoofing:
GPS spoofing, also known as
simulation
, refers to the practice of
manipulating
or tricking
a GPS receiver by broadcasting false GPS signals.
Essentially, it
misleads the GPS receiver
into believing it is located somewhere it is not,
resulting in the device providing inaccurate location data.
This form of cyberattack undermines the reliability of GPS data, which is vital for a variety of applications, from navigation to time synchronization and more.
How Does GPS Spoofing Work?
It
exploits
inherent vulnerabilities in the GPS infrastructure
– the
weak signal strength of GPS satellites.
The Global Positioning System (GPS) functions by sending signals from satellites to GPS receivers on Earth.
These receivers then calculate their position based on the time it takes for these signals to arrive.
However, due to the weak signal strength of the GPS satellites,
these signals can be easily overwhelmed by fake signals,
resulting in inaccurate location data
on the receiving device.
Typically, a GPS spoofer begins by acquiring a basic understanding of the victim’s GPS setup, including the types of signals it uses and how they are processed.
With that information, the
attacker
sends counterfeit GPS signals
that mimic the real ones.
fake signals are stronger,
causing the receiver to recognize them as authentic signals.
As a result, the victim’s GPS receiver ends up processing these counterfeit signals, leading to erroneous location information.

**********Why Inflation Will Be a Key Concern in 2025
Why in news?
2024 has been a bittersweet year for India's economy, with strong growth in the first half that surprised many, including the government.
However, the latter half proved challenging, with growth slowing, inflation remaining high, and ongoing tensions between the RBI and Finance Ministry over policy responses.
What’s in today’s article?
Clamour for a Rate Cut
Economic Outlook: A Year Ago
Economic Performance in 2023-24
Post-Poll Budget: Focus on Employment and Consumption
Early Signs of Growth Slowdown
Inflation and Rate Cut Hopes
The Road Ahead: Growth vs. Inflation
Top government officials have been advocating for an RBI rate cut since November, urging it to prioritize growth and investments over volatile food prices.
This push intensified after Q2 GDP growth slowed to a 7-quarter low of 5.4%, with weak urban demand and disappointing corporate results affecting market sentiment.
This time last year, India’s stock markets were at record highs, and GDP growth was 7.7% in the first half of 2023-24.
The Finance Ministry expected growth to exceed 6.5% for the full year and anticipated an interest rate cut cycle by the RBI, which had projected inflation to average 4% through Q2 2024.
Despite challenges, India’s economy performed better than expected in 2023-24, with the NSO growth estimates revised upwards.
The first half saw 8.1% growth, followed by a strong 8.6% in Q3.
The year ended with a remarkable 8.2% growth, boosted by election-related activities and political continuity post-elections.
In the 2024-25 Union Budget, Finance Minister emphasized employment, middle-class welfare, and schemes to boost skilling and job creation, along with some token income tax cuts.
The government aimed to boost consumption to stimulate private investments while acknowledging the need for continued public infrastructure spending, with an ₹11.11 lakh crore capex plan to support growth.
The first GDP data for 2024-25 showed a 6.7% rise, marking a five-quarter low, due to the extended election period affecting capital spending.
While the mood remained positive initially, growth concerns grew as high interest rates affected urban demand. Growth projections were revised down to around 6.5%, signaling potential cyclical slowdown.
Although consumer inflation remained below 6% for most of the year, it spiked in September due to rising food prices, halting rate cut expectations.
The RBI did not lower rates despite initial hopes, revising its 2024-25 growth forecast down to 6.6%.
The ongoing inflationary pressures and high interest rates continue to strain consumption and investment.
With slowing growth and persistent inflation, the government faces challenges in balancing the two.
While interest rate cuts could help boost demand and investments, inflation remains a barrier.
The RBI and Finance Ministry's differing views on how to handle this growth-inflation flux will be crucial in shaping economic policy for 2025.

**********Navigating India's Complex Foreign Policy Challenges
Context:
After Prime Minister Modi's third term began in June, 2024 saw intense diplomatic activity amidst global insecurity and regional shocks, especially in Bangladesh.
With 2025 likely to be even more unpredictable, India's foreign policy must stay adaptable to change.
What’s in today’s article?
Key highlights of India's external relations
Challenges that preoccupied South Block in 2024
How did Indian foreign policy navigate global conflict?
India's diplomatic agenda for 2025
Key Developments in India-China Relations
The most challenging negotiation of 2024 was the disengagement at the Line of Actual Control with China.
The first Modi-Xi Jinping meeting in five years, held at Kazan during the BRICS summit in Russia, marked a significant step towards rebuilding trust after PLA transgressions since 2020.
Strengthening Strategic Ties with France
French President Emmanuel Macron attended Republic Day as the chief guest, solidifying India-France cooperation in defence, energy, and maritime sectors.
While India aimed to host U.S. President Biden and the Quad summit, Macron’s visit reinforced bilateral dependability.
Progress on Trade Agreements
The conclusion of the India-European Free Trade Association agreement early in 2024 was a milestone, serving as a template for future FTAs.
However, no substantial progress was made on agreements with Australia, the U.K., or the EU by year-end.
Diplomatic Engagements in the Neighborhood
India hosted leaders from most neighboring countries during PM Modi's swearing-in, except Pakistan.
Notable highlights included Bhutan's leadership visits, PM Modi’s trip to Thimphu, and successful diplomatic exchanges with Sri Lanka and Maldives, mending earlier tensions.
Estranged Relations with Bangladesh
The ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August marked a significant setback for India-Bangladesh ties.
Rising attacks on Hindu minorities and Ms. Hasina’s stay in India further strained the once-strong partnership.
Worsening Ties with Canada
Relations with Canada deteriorated after allegations of Indian involvement in the Nijjar killing, with even Home Minister Amit Shah being named.
India retaliated by freezing diplomatic ties with PM Justin Trudeau’s government, awaiting potential change in 2025.
Legal and Diplomatic Challenges with the U.S.
Tensions with U.S. escalated due to indictments against the Adani group and an Indian official linked to the alleged Pannun assassination plot.
However, the election of U.S. President Donald Trump and his pro-India administration offers a glimmer of hope.
Regional Rivalries and China's Influence
The U.S.’s involvement in South Asia, changes in Bangladesh, and China's growing influence in Nepal and neighboring countries remain persistent challenges for India’s foreign policy.
Balancing Act in Global Conflicts
India maintained a neutral stance, advocating for peace amidst the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Israel’s war in Gaza.
PM Modi’s visits to Russia and Ukraine sparked speculation about a potential mediatory role.
Despite meeting Palestinian PM Mahmoud Abbas at the UN and condemning civilian casualties, India avoided explicitly holding Israel accountable at the UN.
Shifting Focus in West Asia
With multilateral initiatives like IMEC and I2U2 facing challenges, India pivoted to bilateral engagements with West Asian nations.
In 2025, navigating tensions between Iran and the Israel-U.S. alliance will be a key challenge for Indian diplomacy.
Strengthening U.S.-India Relations
External Affairs Minister Jaishankar's meetings with the Trump transition team signal a U.S. focus for 2025.
Key events include President Trump’s visit for the Quad Summit and PM Modi’s potential trip to Washington beforehand.
Engagement with Iran and iCET Discussions
India will host a ministerial visit from Iran early in 2025, followed by U.S. NSA Jake Sullivan’s visit for a crucial iCET (Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology) meeting.
High-Profile Diplomatic Visits
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be the Republic Day guest, and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s first visit to Delhi since the war began is expected to be finalized.
