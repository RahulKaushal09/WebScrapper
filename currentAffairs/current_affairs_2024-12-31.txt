On India’s obligations towards the Rohingya
Security Issues
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Refugee crises;
Why in the News?
A recent study by The Azadi Project and Refugees International has found that Rohingya refugees detained in India face serious violations of their basic rights. It also criticizes India for not meeting its responsibilities under international human rights agreements.
What has a recent report said about India’s refugee policy for the Rohingya people?
Human Rights Violations:
The report indicates that Rohingya refugees are subjected to “gross violations of constitutional and human rights,” including arbitrary detention without charges and inhumane living conditions in detention centres.
Call for Legal Revisions:
It urges India to clarify the legal status of Rohingya refugees and revise outdated laws like the Foreigners Act of 1946 to align with international refugee standards.
Recommendations for Action:
The report advocates for the immediate release of vulnerable detainees and calls on international actors, including the U.S. and UNHCR, to engage with India on these issues.
What does the 1951 Refugee Convention state?
The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol establish fundamental principles for the protection of refugees, including:
Non-refoulement:
This principle prohibits states from returning individuals to countries where they may face persecution or serious harm. It is a cornerstone of international refugee law and is considered customary international law, binding even on states not party to the Convention.
Rights of Refugees:
The Convention outlines various rights that refugees are entitled to, such as access to legal assistance, work, education, and social services, ensuring their dignity and protection from discrimination.
Note:
India is not a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention.
What is India’s stand?
Non-signatory Status:
India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its Protocol, which it argues absolves it from legal obligations to provide asylum or adhere to non-refoulement principles.
Detention Practices:
The Indian government continues to detain Rohingya refugees under domestic laws that classify them as illegal migrants. Recent court rulings have reinforced this stance, stating that while they have a right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution, they lack right to reside or settle in India.
Judicial Interpretation:
Despite India’s non-signatory status, some High Courts have interpreted international norms as applicable under Article 21, suggesting a potential pathway for legal protections for refugees.
What are India’s international obligations?
International Treaties:
India is a party to several international human rights treaties that imply obligations related to the treatment of individuals at risk of torture or inhumane treatment. For instance:
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) includes provisions against refoulement (forcible return of refugees) under Article 7.
Other treaties like the Convention Against Torture also emphasise non-refoulement principles, even if India’s ratification status complicates direct enforcement.
Constitutional Mandates:
Article 51(c) of the Indian Constitution encourages respect for international law and treaty obligations. Landmark Supreme Court rulings have indicated that international conventions should guide domestic law when local legislation is lacking
Way forward:
Establish a Comprehensive Refugee Policy
: India should enact a uniform refugee law aligning with international principles, ensuring legal clarity and protection for all refugees, including the Rohingya, while upholding the constitutional mandate under Article 21.
Strengthen Collaboration with UNHCR and Civil Society
: Engage with international agencies and local organizations to improve refugee support systems, focusing on humane detention practices, legal aid, and sustainable resettlement initiatives.
Mains PYQ:
“Refugees should not be turned back to the country where they would face persecution or human right violation”. Examine the statement with reference to ethical dimension being violated by the nation claiming to be democratic with open society.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Space sector;
Why in the News?
Recently, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched its Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) in space with a PSLV rocket.
What is SpaDeX mission?
The SpaDeX mission, or Space Docking Experiment, is a significant initiative by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) aimed at demonstrating advanced in-space docking technology.
Docking technology involves manoeuvring two spacecraft into the same orbit, aligning them precisely, and physically joining them to enable modular assembly, resupply, crew transfer, or sample return missions in space.
What is the significance of India’s achievement in space docking technology?
Joining an Elite Club:
With the successful completion of the SpaDeX mission, India becomes only the fourth country in the world, after the United States, Russia, and China, capable of conducting space docking operations. This positions India as a key player in global space exploration and technology.
Foundation for Future Missions:
The docking capability is crucial for various upcoming missions, including India’s plans for a lunar sample return mission (Chandrayaan-4) and establishing its own space station by 2035. The ability to dock spacecraft allows for complex missions that require multiple launches and assembly in orbit.
How does the SpaDeX mission contribute to India’s future space exploration goals?
Support for Lunar Missions:
SpaDeX is designed to demonstrate technologies necessary for future lunar missions, particularly for Chandrayaan-4, which will involve multiple components that need to be docked in space before proceeding to the Moon.
Bharatiya Antariksh Station:
The mission is a critical step towards building the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS), which will consist of several modules that must be docked together in orbit. The first module is expected to launch by 2028.

**********UPI duopoly’s rise and market vulnerabilities
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Digital transactions;
Why in the News?
In just eight years, UPI now handles nearly 80% of India’s digital transactions which valued at ₹20.60 lakh crore in August, despite challenges like PhonePe and Google Pay’s market dominance.
What are the implications of market concentration in the UPI ecosystem?
Systemic Vulnerability:
The dominance of two Third Party App Providers (TPAPs) for online transactions like UPI PhonePe and Google Pay, which together control over 85% of the market share, creates a risk of systemic failure.
Any disruption in their services could significantly impact the entire UPI ecosystem, given that nearly 80% of transactions occur through these platforms.
Reduced Competition and Innovation:
The high market concentration discourages competition, leading to fewer incentives for innovation among existing players. Smaller or new entrants face significant barriers to entry due to the scale and resources of the dominant TPAPs, stifling diversity in service offerings.
Foreign Dominance Risks:
Both leading TPAPs are foreign-owned, raising concerns about data security and sovereignty. This foreign dominance can lead to potential vulnerabilities in terms of data protection and access to sensitive information about Indian users.
How effective are regulatory measures in addressing duopoly issues?
Regulatory Challenges:
The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has attempted to address market concentration by capping TPAP market shares at 30%. However, this measure has not been effectively enforced, with extensions granted that allow dominant players to maintain their substantial market positions.
Limited Impact of Existing Regulations:
Despite regulatory intentions, the continued growth of PhonePe and Google Pay indicates that existing measures have not sufficiently mitigated the risks associated with a duopoly. The potential increase in market share cap from 30% to 40% may further entrench the dominance of these platforms rather than promote a competitive landscape.
What strategies can smaller players adopt to compete in this landscape?
Innovation and Niche Services:
Smaller players can focus on niche markets or specialized services that cater to specific user needs, differentiating themselves from larger competitors. This could include unique features or localised services that appeal to underserved populations.
Collaboration and Partnerships:
Forming alliances with banks, fintech companies, or other service providers can help smaller players leverage resources and technology to enhance their offerings and reach a broader audience.
User Education and Trust Building:
Investing in user education about digital payments and building trust through transparent practices can attract users who may be hesitant to switch from established platforms. Emphasizing security features and customer support can also enhance user confidence.
What should the Indian Government do to reduce the dependency? (Way forward)
Enforce and Strengthen Regulatory Caps
: Mandate strict enforcement of market share caps for TPAPs and ensure timely compliance to prevent excessive concentration. Introduce penalties for non-compliance and avoid extensions to foster a competitive ecosystem.
Promote Indigenous Development
: Provide financial incentives, subsidies, and grants to Indian TPAPs to enhance their competitiveness. Encourage innovation through dedicated programs and regulatory frameworks that support startups in the payments space.
