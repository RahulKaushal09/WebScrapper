**********What is Information Ratio (IR)?
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) recently directed mutual funds to disclose the information ratio (IR) of a scheme along with performance disclosure.
About Information Ratio (IR):
It is a
metric
for measuring how
a portfolio
or financial asset
fares in regards to a
benchmark
, compared to the volatility of its returns.
This
benchmark is usually a market index
, like Nifty 50. It can also be an index representing any specific industry or market sector.
The
IR depicts how well a portfolio
or asset
is matching and exceeding an index’s returns.
This metric also
shows the level of consistency
a portfolio is able to achieve
in exceeding the returns of such a benchmark.
To that end, this ratio
also includes
standard deviation component
, also
called tracking error
Tracking error
if a portfolio can regularly “track” and exceed its
benchmark returns.
If such tracking error is low
, it
means the portfolio is consistent
. Conversely, if the error is high, it signifies a more volatile performance.
Calculation of IR
takes place based on the following formula:
IR = (Portfolio Rate of Returns – Benchmark Rate of Returns)/Tracking Error
Uses
The IR is primarily used as a
performance measure by fund managers
In addition, it is frequently used to
compare the skills
and abilities of
with similar investment strategies.
The ratio
provides investors with insights about the ability of a fund manager
to sustain the generation of excess, or even abnormal (as in “abnormally high”), returns over time.
Finally,
some hedge funds
and mutual funds
use the IR to calculate the fees
that they charge their clients (e.g., performance fee).

**********Namdhari Sect
Punjab Chief Minister recently paid tribute at a function organised at the Namdhari Shaheed Smarak in Malerkotla to mark the Kuka martyrs’ day.
About Namdhari Sect:
It was founded by
Satguru Ram Singh
of Baisakhi in 1857. He challenged the status quo, advocated social reform, and resisted the British
rule
in various ways.
The Namdharis were
also known as “Kukas”
because of their trademark style of reciting the
“Gurbani”
(Sayings/Teachings of the Guru).
This style was in a high-pitched
voice called “Kook”
in Punjabi. Thus, the Namdharis were also called “Kukas”.
Namdhari Sikhs
consider the Guru Granth Sahib
as the
Supreme Gurbani,
but they also believe in a living human Guru.
The Namdharis consider the cow to be sacred.
The sect’s
headquarters
is located in
Ludhiana’s Bhaini Sahib
near village Raiyaan, where Ram Singh was born.
History of the Kuka martyrs’ day:
On January 13, 1872, a group of some 200 Namdharis led by
Kuka Hira Singh and Lehna Singh reached Malerkotla
following an incident of cow slaughter in the town. The Namdharis had long been agitating for a ban on cow slaughter.
On January 15, the Kukas clashed with government officials. On the very same day, a 150-strong Kuka contingent also attacked the
Malaudh Fort
in Ludhiana, which was under the jurisdiction of a local ruler who was loyal to the British.
The British retribution to the Kuka raids was brutal.
John Lambert Cowan
, the Deputy Commissioner of Ludhiana district, ordered the execution of 49 Kukas on January 17, and another 17 on January 18.

**********Hyperspectral Imaging Satellite
Recently, India’s space tech startup Pixxel launched three of its six hyperspectral imaging satellites which are part of its ‘Firefly’ constellation aboard a SpaceX rocket from California.
About Hyperspectral Imaging Satellite:
These satellites are uniquely designed to beam down
data in hundreds of wavelengths
to detect problems that are invisible to today's satellites.
The constellation is designed to provide global coverage at a revisit of every 24 hours.
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technique that
analyses a wide spectrum of light
instead of just assigning primary colours (red, green, blue) to each pixel, effectively spectrally fingerprinting the Earth to provide more information on what is imaged.
The collected spectra are used to form an image in a way that each image pixel includes a complete spectrum.
What is Firefly’ constellation?
It is India’s first
commercial satellite constellation.
It offers six times sharper resolution than the standard 30-meter resolution of existing hyperspectral satellites, achieving an unprecedented five-meter resolution.
This capability allows it to
capture intricate details
previously invisible to conventional systems.
The satellites’ advanced sensors, capable of
capturing data across more than 150 spectral bands
, enable the detection of subtle changes in chemical compositions, vegetation health, water quality, and atmospheric conditions.

**********India’s Real Growth Rate and the Forecast
Context
The
First Advance Estimates (FAE) of National Accounts for 2024-25 indicate a real GDP growth rate of 6.4%
and a
nominal GDP growth rate of 9.7%.
These figures,
while significant,
fall short of the RBI December 2024 revised growth estimates of 6.6% for real GDP and 10.5% for nominal GDP
as projected in the Union Budget of 2024-25.
deviation highlights emerging challenges in sustaining robust economic growth in India,
compounded by both domestic and international factors.
Analysis of the 2024-25 Economic Performance and Reason Behind the Dip
annual GDP growth rate of 6.4% during 2024-25 reflects an improving trend within the fiscal year,
with growth accelerating from 6% in the first half to 6.7% in the second half.
This
demonstrates recovery from the lowest point (5.4%) during the second quarter (Q2) of the fiscal year 2024-25.
However, the
decline from the 8.2% growth achieved in 2023-24 underscores the transient nature of the previous year’s performance.
manufacturing sector, in particular, experienced a sharp slowdown,
with growth dipping from 9.9% in 2023-24 to 5.3% in 2024-25, a key factor contributing to the lower overall Gross Value Added (GVA).
Government investment trends also play a crucial role
in this scenario.
Capital expenditure growth by the Government of India has been subdued
, with only 46.2% of the ₹11.1 lakh crore Budget target achieved by the end of the first eight months of 2024-25.
Despite potential acceleration in the final months,
the shortfall in government spending has directly affected overall growth.
Prospects for Growth in 2025-26
The Role of Investment
Investment activity
, reflected in the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) rate,
has shown consistent stabilisation around 33.4% over the past few years.
stability provides a solid foundation for economic growth
, indicating sustained capital deployment in productive activities.
Maintaining this level of investment in 2025-26 will be critical,
particularly as India aspires to bridge its infrastructure deficit and boost industrial capacity.
Public sector capital expenditure is a pivotal driver of investment activity.
To catalyse private investment, the government will need to adopt an aggressive approach to infrastructure spending,
ensuring an annual growth rate of at least 20% in capital expenditure based on the revised estimates for 2024-25.
strategy can create a multiplier effec
t, increasing private sector participation, enhancing productivity, and generating employment.
Private Investment and Domestic Demand
alignment of government policies with the needs of the private sector will play a critical role
in improving investment.
By creating a favourable environment through regulatory reforms, fiscal incentives
, and robust public-private partnerships (PPPs),
India can attract more private capital into infrastructure, manufacturing, and technology.
Additionally, sustained domestic demand, driven by rising income levels and urbanisation, will ensure that private investments yield substantial returns.
The Role of Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR)
India’s average ICOR,
a measure of investment efficiency, has
remained slightly above 5 in recent years.
suggests that every ₹5.1 of investment generates ₹1 of GDP.
To achieve a 6.5% growth rate in 2025-26,
the current ICOR must be maintained or improved.
Lowering ICOR through enhanced productivity and innovation will be crucial in maximising the returns
on both public and private investments.
Global Economic Uncertainty
External factors, including geopolitical shifts
and global economic conditions, will
significantly influence India’s growth trajectory.
uncertainty surrounding global trade and financial flows, exacerbated by Donald Trump’s return to office
and potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy,
may create challenges
for India’s export-driven industries.
India’s relatively low dependence on external demand and a large domestic market provide a cushion
against global shocks.
Fiscal Policy and Revenue Mobilisation
critical aspect of the growth strategy for 2025-26
ensuring fiscal discipline
while sustaining high levels of capital expenditure.
Government of India’s ability to achieve its capital expenditure
targets
will depend on effective revenue mobilisation.
In 2024-25, despite nominal GDP growth falling short
of the budgeted 10.5%,
tax revenue growth has shown resilience, with a realised buoyancy of about 1.1.
This trend, if sustained, will ensure minimal revenue shortfalls, enabling the government to maintain its focus on developmental expenditure without exacerbating fiscal deficits.
Boosting Productivity through Reforms
Structural reforms in critical sectors
, including agriculture, labour markets, and financial systems,
will play a decisive role in ensuring sustained growth.
For example,
modernising agriculture through technology and market reforms can unlock higher productivity.
Similarly,
labour reforms can facilitate greater workforce participation
and skill development, contributing to a more competitive manufacturing sector.
Energy and Sustainability
India’s transition to renewable energy
and its commitment to sustainability
also hold significant growth potential.
Investment in green infrastructure
, solar and wind energy, and electric vehicles (EVs
) can create new economic opportunities
while reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
alignment with global sustainability goals will not only attract foreign investment but also position India as a leader
in the global energy transition.
Sectoral Growth Dynamics
Key sectors
such as manufacturing, services, and construction
will be instrumental in achieving the targeted growth rate.
Revitalising
manufacturing through initiatives like Make in India and focusing on innovation in technology-driven sectors can enhance productivity.
Meanwhile,
the service sector, particularly IT, financial services, and tourism, is expected to remain a significant contributor to GDP growth
, supported by digitalization and global outsourcing opportunities.
Evaluations of the Current Growth Rate in the Context of Long-Term Growth Projections
Over the next five years, India’s potential GDP growth rate is estimated at 6.5%,
aligning with the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) projections for the Indian economy from 2025-26 to 2029-30.
Nominal GDP growth during this period is expected to range between 10.5% and 11%,
driven by an implicit price deflator (IPD)-based inflation of about 4%.
In favourable global conditions, real GDP growth could rise to 7%,
particularly if net exports make a significant contribution.
Achieving this growth trajectory would position India for developed country status
within the next two and a half decades.
maintaining consistent growth will become increasingly challenging as the economic base expands
Early years will demand higher growth rates to lay the foundation for sustained performance.
Evaluating the Current Growth Rate
In this context, the 6.4% growth rate for 2024-25 should not be viewed as disappointing
. Instead, it reflects the economy's alignment with its potential growth trajectory.
The remarkable 8.2% growth in 2023-24 can be seen as an anomaly
, fuelled by post-pandemic recovery and other transient factors.
The 2024-25 performance, while modest, underscores the need for strategic planning to capitalise on domestic demand
and enhance productivity.
Conclusion
India’s growth story
is marked by a
delicate balance between aspiration and realism.
6.4% growth in 2024-25 signals a return to a more sustainable trajectory
, with future growth heavily reliant on proactive government policies, strategic investments, and private sector participation.
In the medium term, a focus on structural reforms and capital investment will be vital
to achieve and sustain the 6.5% potential growth rate.
While challenges remain,
the steady alignment with long-term growth potential sets a promising foundation for India’s economic ambitions.

constituting nearly 38% of its imports in 2024
, a significant increase from pre-Ukraine war levels.
The imposition of
a $60-per-barrel price cap by G7 nations redirected Russian oil exports from Europe to Asia
, with India and China being key consumers.
India, dependent on imports for over 85% of its crude oil needs,
faces challenges due to the cost-efficiency and reliability of Russian oil.
India’s response:
Commitment to energy security:
India’s oil imports, including those from Russia, are guided by energy security needs and global market conditions.
External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated that India has
no plans to reduce its oil purchases from Russia
despite the sanctions.
Rush to pay for Russian oil:
Indian refiners are
expediting payments
for Russian crude to circumvent potential US penalties.
Transactions for Gazprom Neft crude, a Russian oil giant, are being processed in
Rubles
instead of dollars to bypass the $60-a-barrel price cap set in 2022.
Analysing Rupee Internationalisation Bid Amid Proposed US Sanctions on Russian Oil:
Challenges ahead:
Efforts to settle India-Russia oil trade in rupees face hurdles as tighter sanctions could disrupt these negotiations.
In contrast, Russia-China trade in non-dollar currencies has
bolstered the yuan's global footprint.
Global reserve currency dynamics:
The US dollar remains dominant, but efforts by BRICS nations to develop alternatives, such as
a potential BRICS currency
, have intensified since 2022.
The attempts to move away from the dollar began after the
US threw Russia out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)
, the key to international financial transactions, in 2022.
US stance:
During his hearing, Bessent reaffirmed the importance of
maintaining the US dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency.
Former President Trump previously
threatened BRICS nations with tariffs if they pursued a rival reserve currency.
Conclusion:
India’s proactive engagement with the US
reflects its commitment to maintaining energy security while navigating the complexities of international sanctions.
As one of Russia’s top oil buyers,
India continues to prioritize its economic and strategic interests amidst evolving global dynamics.

**********Third launchpad at Satish Dhawan Space Center
Why in news?
The Union Cabinet approved the establishment of a third launchpad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, to support ISRO's future use of the heavier Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV).
SDSC, India's sole spaceport, became operational in 1971 with the launch of the 'Rohini-125' rocket and was renamed in 2002 to honor former ISRO Chairman Satish Dhawan.
What’s in today’s article?
Satish Dhawan: A Pioneer in Indian Space Science
The Search for India's Ideal Satellite Launch Site
Why Sriharikota Was Chosen as the Launch Site?
ISRO to Get a Third Launch Pad: Key Highlights
Early Life and Achievements
Born in Srinagar, Satish Dhawan was an eminent rocket scientist, hailed as the 'Father of Experimental Fluid Dynamics research' in India.
He made significant contributions to the study of turbulence and boundary layers.
Leadership at ISRO
In 1972, Dhawan succeeded Vikram Sarabhai as the Chairman of ISRO.
Under his leadership, India’s space program witnessed remarkable growth, including the development of operational systems like:
INSAT
: A telecommunications satellite.
IRS
: The Indian Remote Sensing satellite.
PSLV
: A launch vehicle that elevated India to a spacefaring nation.
Legacy and Recognition
After his passing in 2002, the space center at Sriharikota was renamed the
to honor his transformative contributions.
Search begins
In the 1960s, India embarked on a mission to indigenously develop satellites and launch vehicles under the leadership of Vikram Sarabhai, the founder of the Indian space program.
He tasked scientist EV Chitnis with finding a suitable launch site on the country’s east coast.
Survey and Selection of Sriharikota
In March 1968, information and maps of potential sites, including Sriharikota, were gathered.
Quick Execution and Acquisition
By August 1968, Sarabhai conducted a survey of Sriharikota.
In October 1968, ~40,000 acres of land in Sriharikota were acquired, showcasing the remarkable speed and efficiency of the process.
Ideal Location on the East Coast
Sriharikota’s position on the east coast allows rockets to be launched eastwards, leveraging Earth’s rotation for additional velocity.
This provides a significant boost of about 450 m/s, increasing payload capacity.
Proximity to the Equator
Being close to the equator is advantageous for launching geostationary satellites, as they need to be in the equatorial plane.
The closer the launch site to the equator, the more efficient the launch.
Uninhabited and Sea Proximity
Sriharikota's sparsely populated area and proximity to the sea ensure a safe flight path over the ocean, where separated rocket hardware can fall without risks or constraints.
Purpose of the Third Launch Pad (TLP)

**********Cabinet approves refarming of 687 Mhz of spectrum
Why in news?
The Union Cabinet has approved the refarming of 687 MHz of spectrum for mobile services, increasing the total available spectrum to 1,587 MHz, with 320 MHz to be released immediately and the rest by 2028-29. The re-farmed spectrum primarily comes from the Ministry of Defence and ISRO.
Union Telecom Minister stated that mobile services will require 2,000 MHz of spectrum by 2030. Currently, 900 MHz is available, leaving a gap of 1,100 MHz.
The refarming aligns with industry demands for efficient use of mid-band spectrum (1,000–6,000 MHz) and prepares for future needs.
What’s in today’s article?
Airwaves/Spectrum – About, types of spectrum band, bands useful for telecom companies
Refarming of spectrum
Airwaves are radio frequencies within the electromagnetic spectrum that can carry information wirelessly for a range of services including telecommunications.
The government manages and allocates airwaves to companies or sectors for their use.
The government auctions a fixed amount of spectrum within specified band/s to be utilised by operators for providing communication services to consumers.
Types of spectrum band
Low band spectrum
Less than 1 GHz (600 MHz,700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz)
Offers blanket coverage suitable to serve thousands of customers over long distances with fewer towers.
Ideal for wide and in-building coverage.
When bundled with high-spectrum bands, it can be used for commercial mobile and broadcasting services.
The mid-band spectrum
Ranges from 1 GHz to 6 GHz (1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, and 2300 MHz).
Provides coverage as well as the capacity to carry more data while traveling significant distances.
The high band spectrum
Ranges from 24 GHz to 40 GHz and are also known as the millimetre wave spectrum.
Ideal for speedy networks over short ranges.
However, this range is subject to interference from dense objects.
What spectrum do telecom companies require?
Optimal Spectrum Range for Telecom Services
The 400 MHz to 4 GHz range is considered the most suitable for telecom services, as per the GSM Association.
Sufficient spectrum allows operators to provide 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G services using a single frequency band.
Frequency Bands for Mobile Technology in India
2G Services
: 900 MHz and 1800 MHz.
3G Services
: 900 MHz and 2100 MHz.
4G Services
: 850 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2300 MHz, and 2500 MHz.
5G Services
: 700 MHz and 3.5 GHz bands.
Significance of the 900 MHz Band
Offers a well-developed commercial ecosystem with superior technology standards.
Supports GSM-based voice calls and 4G broadband services.
Role of the 1800 MHz Band
The 1800 MHz band is a key spectrum for GSM services and is globally used as the core band for LTE (4G).
5G Spectrum Classification
5G spectrum is categorized into low, mid, and high-frequency bands for efficient deployment and operations.
Spectrum refarming is the process of
repurposing spectrum bands
for more efficient technologies or new services.
For example, a provider using the 900 MHz band for 2G services may reallocate part of it for
LTE (Long-term evolution)
to meet increasing data demand.
The GSMA defines spectrum refarming as reallocating frequency bands traditionally used for 2G (GSM technology) to newer mobile technologies like
3G (UMTS
-Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) and
4G (LTE).
Why is Spectrum Refarming important?
To maximize the capacity and efficiency of a network by moving older, less demanding services to a smaller portion of the spectrum, freeing up space for newer, more data-intensive technologies.
Spectrum is a scarce resource and with growing demand for mobile broadband and advanced technologies like LTE and 5G, spectrum must be utilized efficiently.
It enables
Communications Service Providers (CSPs)
to upgrade from legacy networks to 4G or 5G based on consumer demand and market growth.
Benefits
Increased network capacity
Improved network performance
Cost-effective way to upgrade networks without buying new spectrum
Challenges
Service Continuity
CSPs must ensure there are no interruptions or degradation in services during the refarming process.
Device Compatibility
Some devices only support specific frequency bands, so they must continue operating on legacy networks.
Thorough Analysis
CSPs must analyze device types and user behavior to determine the appropriate spectrum allocation for different technologies without compromising service quality.
Channel Interference
Ensuring no interference between channels is crucial during spectrum refarming.
Contiguous Spectrum
A sufficient, contiguous spectrum is needed to support the simultaneous operation of multiple technologies within a frequency band.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Since earlier this month Los Angeles has been gripped by devastating
wildfires
fueled by a rare and alarming meteorological phenomenon known as hydroclimate whiplash.
Hydroclimate whiplash refers to
rapid and extreme shifts
between periods of intensely
wet weather
and dangerously
dry conditions
Characteristics:
Alternates between
heavy rainfall
severe drought
Typically results in amplified weather extremes, such as floods followed by wildfires.
Global Trend:
Hydroclimate whiplash has increased by
31% to 66% worldwide
since the mid-20th century, largely due to
climate change
Projections indicate a
113% rise
in such events during sub-seasonal periods with a
3°C increase in global temperatures
Causes of Hydroclimate Whiplash
Rising global temperatures
intensify
hydrological extremes
, causing prolonged periods of
Warmer air holds more moisture, leading to heavier rainfalls during wet periods and exacerbating droughts during dry phases.
Shifts in
El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
cycles influence precipitation and temperature extremes.
Changes in ocean currents and wind patterns
disrupt normal weather cycles, contributing to hydroclimate variability.
Unusual delays in wet or dry season
s can magnify hydroclimate swings, as seen in regions like California.
How did this phenomenon cause wildfire in LA?
The usual wet season, which begins in October, failed during 2024-25, exacerbating dry conditions and increasing fire hazards.
As dry air moves from high-pressure regions over southwestern deserts to low-pressure zones off the California coast, it warms and dries further, creating ideal wildfire conditions.
Impacts of Hydroclimate Whiplash
Wet periods encourage vegetation growth
, which becomes fuel during subsequent dry periods, increasing wildfire risks.
Intense rainfall during wet periods leads to
flash floods
soil erosion
, damaging ecosystems and infrastructure.
Crops are damaged
by alternating floods and droughts, reducing
yields
and increasing food insecurity.
Roads, dams, and buildings face significant damage from floods, leading to
high repair costs
Floods contribute to the spread of
