Crimes Against Humanity and an Obtuse Indian Stance
Context
Recently, the United Nations General Assembly
(UNGA) adopted a resolution approving the text
of a
proposed treaty for the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity (CAH).
The
journey to this point began in 2019
when the International Law Commission submitted the draft text to the Sixth Committee of the UNGA.
This
development addresses a crucial gap in international criminal law and lays the foundation for a robust legal framework
to prevent and punish CAH globally.
An Analysis of the Accountability Gap in International Law
Lack of a Legal Framework
Crimes against humanity (CAH) are among the most egregious violations of international law,
yet the legal framework governing them lacks the comprehensiveness and clarity
afforded to other international crimes like genocide and war crimes.
This gap
stems from the absence of a dedicated treaty specifically addressing CAH,
unlike the Genocide Convention of 1948 and the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which provide clear mandates and obligations for preventing and prosecuting these crimes.
CAH, despite being codified in the Rome Statute
of the International Criminal Court (ICC),
suffer from limitations in enforcement and scope.
The Rome Statute, adopted in 1998
, is the
treaty that established the ICC to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes
, crimes against humanity, and aggression.
It
aims to ensure accountability for serious international crimes
and promote global justice.
The Jurisdictional Challenge of the ICC
One of the primary accountability challenges lies in the
ICC’s limited jurisdiction.
As a treaty-based institution,
the ICC can only exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of its member states
or by their nationals, unless the United Nations Security Council refers a case to it.
limitation excludes a significant number of states
, including major global players, from the ICC’s reach
It creates a jurisdictional void
where perpetrators in non-member states can evade justice.
Without a dedicated treaty
obligating broader state cooperation
, many CAH cases remain unaddressed.
Individual Versus State Accountability
Another issue is the
Rome Statute’s focus on individual criminal responsibility,
which, while vital, does not account for state accountability.
Genocide and war crimes treaties create state obligations to prevent and punish these crimes,
enabling legal actions at the state level.
For example,
The Gambia's 2019 case against Myanmar
at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was made possible because the
Genocide Convention includes provisions for state responsibility.
A CAH treaty could similarly empower states and international bodies to hold governments accountable
for failing to prevent CAH, reinforcing the principle that states share responsibility for safeguarding human rights.
India’s Position on the CAH Treaty
A Cautious Approach
India’s stance on the proposed CAH treaty reflects a cautious and calculated approach,
rooted in its broader concerns about international criminal justice mechanisms.
As a non-signatory to the Rome Statute
of the ICC,
India has consistently expressed reservations about the ICC’s jurisdiction
, the powers of its prosecutor, and the role of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in its framework.
These concerns shape India’s scepticism toward a CAH treaty
, even as the international community advances efforts to address the gaps in prosecuting such grave crimes.
Scepticism Toward the ICC Framework
India’s primary critique of the ICC
lies in its perceived
infringement on national sovereignty.
The ICC, through its jurisdiction, can investigate and prosecute individuals
from states that are not party to the Rome Statute if authorised by the UNSC.
India views this provision as a potential overreach,
particularly when the UNSC’s influence is often shaped by geopolitical considerations.
Additionally,
India has expressed concerns about the prosecutor’s discretionary powers,
which it argues could lead to selective justice or politically motivated investigations.
These reservations inform India’s apprehension that a CAH treaty might inadvertently extend the ICC’s influence
or create overlapping jurisdictions that undermine state sovereignty.
Disagreements on the Definition and Scope of CAH
India’s position on CAH is also influenced by its
divergence from the existing definitions and scope proposed in international forums.
While the
Rome Statute includes crimes such as enforced disappearance, India opposes its inclusion in the CAH framework
, arguing that it is not universally applicable or adequately defined.
Conversely,
India has strongly advocated for the inclusion of terrorism as a crime against humanity,
emphasising its global threat and the necessity for international recognition of its severity.
India has also criticised the exclusion of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction from the definition of war crimes
under the Rome Statute,
further fuelling its scepticism about the comprehensiveness of the proposed treaty.
Preference for National Jurisdiction
India’s resistance to joining international treaties like the Rome Statute is rooted in its belief that
national legislations and judicial systems are better suited to address crimes against humanity and other international crimes
At the UN General Assembly, I
ndia has consistently emphasised the primacy of domestic jurisdiction, arguing that local courts,
being more attuned to the specific social and political contexts, are
better equipped to ensure justice.
However,
this argument reveals a contradiction: India lacks comprehensive domestic legislation addressing international crimes, including CAH,
leaving a critical gap in its legal framework.
Calls for Further Deliberation
For the past five years,
India has advocated for an in-depth study and thorough discussions on the need for a CAH treaty.
It has argued that
duplicating the regime established under the Rome Statute could lead to inefficiencies
and redundancies.
India’s stance reflects a broader caution
about the potential proliferation of international legal mechanisms that may overlap or conflict with existing frameworks.
this call for deliberation could also be interpreted as a delay tactic, given India’s longstanding reservations about international criminal justice frameworks.
The Way Forward for India
To align its stated preference for national jurisdiction with its international obligations,
India must prioritise the incorporation of CAH and other international crimes into its domestic legal framework.
This move would not only address the current legal lacuna but also strengthen India’s credibility
on the global stage.
Moreover,
by actively engaging in negotiations on the CAH treaty, India could advocate for the inclusion of issues it deems critical
, such as terrorism and nuclear weapons, while shaping the treaty to reflect its interests and concerns.
Taking a proactive role in the CAH treaty process would allow India to reaffirm its commitment to justice and human rights
, positioning itself as a leader in the fight against impunity for grave international crimes.
Conclusion
The adoption of the resolution for a CAH treaty is a landmark step in the international community’s efforts
to combat impunity for crimes against humanity.
While India’s reservations reflect legitimate concerns,
its lack of domestic legislation addressing international crimes undermines its position.
By enacting comprehensive laws against CAH, India can not only address this inconsistency but also lead the way in the global quest for justice
, embodying the role of a true global leader.

Editorial Analysis
**********Rationalising Subsidies and Strengthening Fiscal Management
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
RBI’s Report (Key Concerns, Recommendations, Significance, etc.)
Conclusion
Introduction:
RBI has raised concerns over the rising expenditure of states on subsidies and highlighted the need for rationalization to ensure fiscal sustainability.
These observations were made in the report titled "
State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2024-25
", released recently.
The report sheds light on pressing fiscal challenges such as subsidy rationalization, debt consolidation, and expenditure efficiency.
Key Concerns Raised by the RBI:
Subsidy Expenditure:
States have significantly increased spending on
, including:
Farm loan waivers
Free or subsidised services
(electricity, transport, gas cylinders)
Cash transfers to farmers, youth, and women
Such subsidies often crowd out spending on critical infrastructure and developmental projects.
Rising Subnational Debt:
While state debt as a percentage of GDP declined from
31.8% in 2004
28.5% in 2024
, it remains above the
20% threshold
recommended by the
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Review Committee (2017)
Persistent high debt levels necessitate a transparent and time-bound roadmap for
Cooperative Fiscal Federalism:
The proliferation of
Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)
reduces flexibility in state spending.
Rationalising CSS can provide budgetary space for states to address specific local needs while reducing fiscal stress for both the Union and state governments.
Recommended Measures:
Rationalisation of Subsidies:
States need to
contain and streamline subsidy outgoes
to prioritise more productive expenditure areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
Example: Delhi’s
Mukhya Mantri Mahila Samman Yojna
, offering monthly financial assistance to women, is one of many schemes contributing to rising subsidy burdens.
Debt Consolidation:
Adopting a clear and transparent
debt consolidation strategy
aligned with macroeconomic goals can ensure
debt sustainability
economic resilience
Efficiency in Public Expenditure:
Outcome budgeting
(A budgeting method where expenditure is linked to measurable outcomes, ensuring resources are used efficiently) is proposed to link spending with measurable outcomes, ensuring:
Accountability in resource allocation
Focus on high-impact developmental projects
Greater public trust and transparency
Climate Budgeting:
States are urged to adopt
climate budgeting
to integrate
climate action
into fiscal planning, ensuring sustainability in resource use.
Enhancing Fiscal Transparency:
Reliable, comprehensive, and timely fiscal data is essential for better
risk assessment
Transparent reporting of
off-budget borrowings
can reduce borrowing costs and improve fiscal discipline.
Off-Budget Borrowings
: Loans taken by government-related entities not reflected in the official budget, which can obscure fiscal liabilities.
Significance of the Recommendations:
Rationalising Subsidies:
Reduces fiscal burden and ensures resources are channelled toward long-term development.
Frees up funds for sectors such as infrastructure and education, fostering economic growth.
Aligning state debt levels with
FRBM Committee recommendations
can strengthen fiscal stability.
Transparent debt strategies boost investor confidence and lower borrowing costs.
Cooperative Federalism:
Rationalising CSS aligns state and central objectives, reducing duplication and inefficiency in spending.
Climate Action:
Climate budgeting promotes
sustainable development
, addressing both ecological and economic goals.
Fiscal Discipline and Transparency:
Enhanced reporting standards improve decision-making and foster
public accountability
Conclusion:
The RBI’s recommendations underscore the importance of
rationalising subsidies
, improving expenditure efficiency, and ensuring fiscal transparency.
These steps are essential for fostering sustainable development while addressing mounting fiscal challenges.
By implementing such measures, states can strike a balance between meeting immediate social needs and achieving long-term economic resilience.

**********What is a Dark Comet?
NASA scientists are closely studying a new class of celestial objects known as “dark comets”.
About Dark Comets:
They are celestial bodies which
lack the glowing tails
(a typical feature of comets) and resemble asteroids.
They are often
small, just a few meters
to a few hundred meters wide.
They have less surface area for material to escape and form into the beautiful tails we see on typical comets.
But they are not asteroids due to their sudden accelerations.
They often
spin quite rapidly
and disperse escaping gas and dust in all directions, making them less visible.
They follow
elongated, elliptical paths
that bring them close to the Sun before sweeping back out to the farthest reaches of the Solar System.
The first indication of
dark comets came in 2016
, when asteroid 2003 RM exhibited unusual orbital deviations.
Since then, astronomers have confirmed the existence of dark comets, with a new study published which revealed 14 such objects.
These comets fall into two main categories:
“outer dark comets,”
which have eccentric orbits and are larger, and
“inner dark comets,”
which are smaller and closer to the Sun, with nearly circular orbits.

**********Market Turmoil Amid US Fed Guidance and Rupee Depreciation
Why in News?
The U.S. Federal Reserve's (or Fed, which is the central bank of US) remarks suggesting two rate cuts in 2025 instead of the four originally announced caused frontline stock market indices to fall more than 1%.
Additionally, the Indian rupee (INR) fell to its lowest point ever, 85.13 (spot) to the US dollar, due to a sell-off that was allegedly spearheaded by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs).
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is a Fed Rate Cut?
Why Does the Fed Cut Rates?
Impact of the Fed Rate Cut on Financial Markets
Recent US Fed Rate Cut Decision and its Global Impacts
Indian Market Response US Fed Rate Cuts
Future Outlook for India
A Fed rate cut refers to
a reduction in the federal funds rate
, the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight.
Set by the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (
FOMC
), this rate serves as a
benchmark for various interest rates in the economy
The Fed uses rate cuts cautiously
to strike a balance
between promoting growth and controlling inflation.
The Federal Reserve adjusts the federal funds rate to achieve
two main objectives:
Price stability:
Managing inflation to keep it within an acceptable range.
Maximum employment:
Stimulating economic growth and job creation.
Key reasons for a rate cut include:
Boosting economic growth:
When the economy weakens, lower rates encourage borrowing and spending.
Counteracting external shocks:
Events like financial crises or global pandemics may prompt the Fed to lower rates.
By lowering rates, the Fed aims to stimulate economic activity,
making borrowing cheaper and increasing disposable income
for individuals and businesses.
Impact of the Fed Rate Cut on Financial Markets:
Stock market rally:
Investors perceive rate cuts as positive, often leading to a rise in stock prices.
Bond price increase:
Existing bonds with higher interest payments become more valuable as new bond rates drop.
Currency depreciation:
A weaker US dollar can make American exports more competitive globally, potentially boosting economic growth.
Recent US Fed Rate Cut Decision and its Global Impacts:
US Fed decision:
The US Federal Reserve
reduced its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points
to a range of 4.25%-4.5%.
It signaled only two rate cuts for 2025
, down from the previously projected four, unsettling global markets.
Federal Reserve Chairman
Jerome Powell
emphasised a
cautious approach due to concerns over inflation.
Global market reaction:
US stock indices suffered significant losses:
Dow Jones fell 2.5%, its longest losing streak since 1974. S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite plunged 3% and 3.5%, respectively.
Asian markets mirrored the downturn:
Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped over 1%.
Indian Market Response US Fed Rate Cuts:
Stock market decline:
BSE Sensex fell by 964.15 points (1.2%) to 79,218.05.
Nifty closed at 23,951.7, down by 247.15 points (1.02%).
Sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as banking and real estate, faced sharp declines.
Rupee at record low:
The Indian Rupee closed at an all-time low of 85.07 against the US Dollar.
Persistent FPI outflows (reached Rs 4,224.94 crore on Thursday), strong US Dollar, and global equity sell-offs pressured the currency.
Shift to defensive investments:
Defensive sectors like
pharmaceuticals
outperformed as investors sought safer options amid volatility.
Midcap and small-cap indices
also declined but showed partial recovery by the session’s end.
Future Outlook for India:
RBI’s monetary policy influence:
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may
postpone significant rate cuts
to navigate global uncertainties.
Intervention by the RBI or lower crude oil prices could offer temporary support to the rupee.

**********Coconut oil an edible oil or a haircare product
Why in news?
For over 15 years, the classification of coconut oil as an edible oil or a haircare product under India’s tax regime remained unresolved.
The Supreme Court, on December 18, 2024, ruled that coconut oil should be classified as an
and taxed at a lower GST rate of 5% instead of 18% for haircare products. The court based its decision on the predominant use of coconut oil as a cooking medium, particularly when packaged in small quantities. This ruling resolves a long-standing ambiguity and aligns taxation with the product's primary usage.

Coconut Oil Taxation in India
Summary of Coconut Oil Tax Disputes
Supreme Court's Decision on Coconut Oil Taxation
Taxation Under the CET Act, 1985
Prior to GST, coconut oil was taxed under the
Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (CET Act)
In 2005, the CET Act classified coconut oil under Section III as
“Animal or Vegetable Fats and Oils”
with an 8% excise duty, distinguishing it from haircare products under Section VI, which carried a 16% excise duty.
These classifications followed international norms set by the
Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN)
by the World Customs Organisation (1988).
2009 Circular and Subsequent Developments
In June 2009, the Central Board of Excise and Customs issued a circular to classify
coconut oil sold in containers under 200 ml as hair oil
and taxed it at 16%.
However, this circular was
withdrawn in October 2015
, following tribunal and court rulings that retail packaging size alone does not define coconut oil as hair oil.
Taxation Under the GST Regime (2017 Onwards)
With the introduction of GST in 2017, coconut oil was categorized under
edible oils
, attracting a 5% tax.
Haircare products under the category
“Preparations for use on the hair”
continued to attract a higher tax rate of 18%.
Conclusion
The rulings and decisions have consistently leaned towards classifying coconut oil based on its predominant use rather than packaging size or presumed purpose.
2007 Show-Cause Notices to Madhan Agro Industries
Central Excise authorities issued show-cause notices to Madhan Agro Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd., proposing a higher tax rate by classifying coconut oil as a haircare product.
Madhan Agro, selling coconut oil in packets ranging from 5 ml to 2 litres, challenged the notices before the
Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT)
in Chennai.
CESTAT Ruling on Coconut Oil
The CESTAT ruled that coconut oil should be classified as an
, not a haircare product, in line with the 2005 amendment to the CET Act.
The decision was based on the product's predominant use as an edible oil, irrespective of packaging size.
Similar Cases and Appeals
Similar rulings were passed by the CESTAT in challenges to show-cause notices issued to other enterprises, all based in Puducherry and producing coconut oil in small containers.
Commissioner of Central Excise, Salem
, challenged these orders before the Supreme Court, escalating the matter to the highest judicial level.
2018 Split Verdict
Justice Ranjan Gogoi held that coconut oil should be classified as
, regardless of packaging size.
Justice R Banumathi applied the
“Common Parlance Test”
, ruling that coconut oil sold in small packages is perceived as
in the market and should be taxed accordingly.
2024 Final Verdict
A bench comprising Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Sanjay Kumar, and Justice R Mahadevan provided clarity on the matter:
Rejection of Common Parlance Test
The court ruled that the
can only be applied if the product is not clearly defined or addressed under the law.
Since coconut oil is explicitly defined under legal and international HSN norms, the test is unnecessary.
Classification Based on Specific Legal Headings
The court emphasized that legal headings and international HSN norms cannot be ignored when classifying goods.
Coconut oil's ability to serve as a cosmetic or hair product does not exclude it from the category of edible oil.
Container Size Not a Decisive Factor
Small container sizes are common for both
hair oils
, and container size alone is insufficient for classification.
The court referred to the
Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 1977
, which specify permissible sizes for edible oils (e.g., 50 ml, 100 ml, 200 ml, 1 litre, etc.).
The court classified coconut oil as edible oil for taxation purposes, ensuring consistency with HSN norms and rejecting subjective market perceptions or packaging size as criteria.
