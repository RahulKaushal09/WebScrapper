REMEMBERING THE ‘IRON MAN OF INDIA’
Syllabus
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Context:
National Unity Day is celebrated in India on 31st October. It was introduced by the Government of India in 2014. The day is celebrated to mark the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Background: –
Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, famously known as Sardar Patel was the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home minister of India. Patel was a leader of the Indian National Congress and played a significant role in India’s struggle for freedom.
Key takeaways
Early Life and Role in the Freedom Movement
Born on October 31, 1875, in Nadiad, Gujarat, Patel initially pursued a career in law. Inspired by Gandhi, he joined the independence movement. Notably, his leadership in the Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928, where farmers protested against increased taxes, earned him the title “Sardar” (leader).
Sardar Patel’s contribution to uniting India
As the first Home Minister of independent India, Sardar Patel played a crucial role in unifying and shaping the nation.
At the time of independence, the British presented the challenge of declaring the Indian princely states as independent under the Indian Independence Act of 1947.
The issue of the princely states was complex and challenging to resolve. When the British announced their departure, many princes believed it was the perfect moment to declare their independence. Additionally, there were others who found themselves in a struggle between India and Pakistan.
However, through his diplomatic efforts, Patel secured the accession of the princely states, aligning these regions with the nation’s constitutional framework.
Patel adopted various approaches based on the situation; he offered friendly advice in some cases, persuaded rulers to see reason in others, and even used force in the case of Hyderabad. He was valued for his political astuteness and pragmatic skills, which were essential in bringing together the more than 500 royal territories into the fold of the Indian union.
Sardar Patel’s contribution to administration
Along with the monumental task of unifying India, the Iron Man of India, Patel also played a crucial role in reinforcing the steel frame of India — the All India Services.
He was instrumental in the establishment of the modern all-India services system. For this he is remembered as the “patron saint of India’s civil servants”.
Sardar Patel’s Contribution to Constitution
As the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minorities, and Tribal and Excluded Areas of the Constituent Assembly, Patel played a key role in shaping important sections of the Constitution concerning fundamental and minority rights.

‘PINK TICKET’ REPORT
Mains – GS 2
: A recent report on the free public bus transport for women in Delhi shows a positive picture.
Titled ‘Riding The Justice Route’, the report was released by Greenpeace India on Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the Delhi government’s ‘pink ticket’ policy that made commuting on public buses free for women, after surveying the participants and assessing the impact of the scheme on their lives.
As per the report, one in four women have started using buses after travel was made fare-free.
After the scheme’s introduction, 23 per cent of women have started using buses at least four times a week, and 15 per cent of women, who rarely or never used buses before the scheme, now use them regularly.
When it comes to challenges faced by women, the survey says that a little less than 50 per cent of women bus users feel “mostly safe” while travelling to the bus stop, waiting there, and riding a bus. The survey also suggests that 77 per cent of women feel unsafe while travelling by bus after 5 pm and two in three women find the lighting at the bus stop inadequate.
Frequency also remains a challenge as 87 per cent of the women reported waiting more than 10 minutes, while a good 13 per cent waited more than 30 minutes for the bus.
The impact of the scheme on the perception of women towards public transport across income groups is noteworthy. After the ‘pink ticket’ was introduced, 88 per cent of women surveyed perceived the scheme as impactful in promoting bus use among women.

UNITED NATIONS RELIEF AND WORKS AGENCY FOR PALESTINE REFUGEES IN THE NEAR EAST (UNRWA)
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT AFFAIRS
Israel’s parliament passed two Bills to ban the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees In The Near East (UNRWA) from operating in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The Knesset also voted to designate UNRWA a terrorist organisation, cutting all ties with the agency.
The UNRWA was established in 1949 to provide aid to Palestinians who were forced to leave their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Israel has argued that the UNRWA’s role is obsolete, and its work is an impediment to a peace settlement. However, critics have blamed Israel’s own actions, such as not meaningfully recognising the foundation of a Palestinian state, as having perpetuated the longstanding conflict.
What is the UNRWA, and what role does it play?
UNRWA is mandated by the UN General Assembly to serve ‘Palestine refugees’. This term was defined in 1952 as any person whose “normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict. Palestine refugees are persons who fulfil the above definition and descendants of fathers fulfilling the definition.
In addition, the UN Assembly has also mandated UNRWA to offer services to certain other persons who require humanitarian assistance, on an emergency basis as and when required, in UNRWA fields of operations. Notably, the Assembly has mandated the Agency to provide services to persons in the region who are currently displaced and in serious need of continued assistance as a result of the 1967 and subsequent hostilities. These persons are not registered as Palestine refugees.
Only the UN General Assembly can change the mandate of UNRWA, the definition of a Palestine refugee and whom the Agency is mandated to serve.
UNRWA began operations on May 1, 1950. It operates in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as well as in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan — where Palestinian refugees took shelter after their expulsion.
An estimated 5.9 million Palestinian refugees — most of whom are descendants of the original refugees — currently access the UNRWA’s services.
The UN agency is funded mostly by voluntary contributions from donor states such as the United States, Germany, the European Union, etc. It also gets a limited subsidy from the UN, which is used only for administrative costs.
UNRWA employs some 30,000 Palestinians. More than 200 of its staff members have been killed in Israeli attacks over the past year.
So why has Israel acted against the UNRWA?
Israel has also accused some of UNRWA’s 13,000 employees in Gaza of participating in the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel by Hamas.
Although UNRWA fired nine employees after an investigation, it has denied that it aids armed groups on purpose — the agency has been sharing the list of its employees with Israel for a long time.
What are the two Bills that Israel has passed?
One of the Bills bars UNRWA from operating any representative office, providing any service, or conducting any activity, directly or indirectly, in Israel’s sovereign territory.
The second Bill cuts all ties between government employees and UNRWA, and takes away the legal immunities of the agency’s staff.
Together, the Bills are likely to stop UNRWA from operating in Gaza and the West Bank as Israel controls access to both these Palestinian territories. They could also force the agency to relocate its headquarters from East Jerusalem.
What can be the impact of these measures?
Since the beginning of the war, almost all of Gaza’s 2 million people have been reliant on UNRWA for basic necessities, including food, water, and hygiene supplies.
Along with the Palestinian Red Crescent, UNRWA handles almost all UN aid distribution in the territory.
In the West Bank, UNRWA currently provides services for 19 refugee camps, more than 90 schools, and several health services, including prenatal care.

UNPAID WORK
Mains – GS 3
The invisibility of women’s contributions to the economy through unpaid care work, parenting, and domestic responsibilities has been a growing topic of research and discussion.
While the System of National Accounts has included household production in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) calculations since 1993, it has notably excluded unpaid care work.
Data reveal that women not in the labour force spend over seven hours daily on unpaid domestic and care work. Employed women closely follow, dedicating 5.8 hours to similar tasks.
In contrast, unemployed men spend less than four hours, while employed men contribute only 2.7 hours daily. This stark contrast underscores the significant burden of unpaid labour borne by women.
Globally, there is a growing effort to recognise and value unpaid work, as countries increasingly understand its significant economic contributions.
In 2016, the United Nations integrated this focus into its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in SDG 5, which emphasises achieving gender equality and empowering women.
SDG Target 5.4 seeks to recognise and value unpaid care and domestic work through supportive policies and shared household responsibilities, particularly in low and middle-income countries by 2030.
Economic value of unpaid work
Unpaid work in India contributes approximately 7.5% of the country’s GDP, according to a 2023 State Bank of India report.
Addressing this imbalance could have substantial economic implications. Research indicates that enhancing women’s participation in the labour force could boost India’s GDP by as much as 27%.
To harness this potential for economic growth, it is vital to create policies that recognise and value unpaid work, encouraging gender equity in the workforce and boosting India’s overall productivity.

FERTILIZER IMPORTS
With the crisis continuing in Ukraine and Gaza, experts and policymakers are concerned about further increases in the prices of the components used for making petroleum-based chemical fertilizers.
The Agriculture Minister of Uttar Pradesh recently complained that the State has the stock of fertilizers for only 10 more days. The sowing of winter rabi crops has started and fertilizers such as Diammonium phosphate (DAP) and NPK [Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium] are essential for its growth.
What is the current import fertilizer import scenario?
Standing Committee of Parliament on Chemicals and Fertilizers tabled a report expressing concern that the production capacity of fertilizers does not commensurate with its demand/requirement and, therefore, the gap between demand and supply is met through imports.
According to the report, about 20% of the domestic requirement of urea, 50-60% of the domestic requirement of DAP, and 100% of the domestic requirement of Muriate of Potassium (MOP, or Potash) is met through imports.
What is the situation in Ukraine and Gaza?
There is no stability in fertilizer markets due to the situations in Ukraine and Gaza. Impact of the conflicts on oil prices will spill over to the by-products such as fertilizers.
According to an answer provided in Lok Sabha, in 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21, India’s fertilizer imports were mostly from countries such as China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Iran and Egypt. The worsening situation could impact imports from these regions.
What can India do?
India has to enhance its fertilizer production capacity and shift its farming systems to reduce dependence on imported fertilizers while making better use of the existing fertilizers. Suggestions such as using nano urea, shifting to natural farming, and enhancing the capacity of fertilizer factories have also been made.
The Standing Committee of Parliament also pointed out the need for policy initiatives aimed at creating an environment that would facilitate investments in the public, co-operatives, and private sectors engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of fertilizers.
Commenting on the new investment policy, implemented in 2012, to streamline fertilizer production, the committee said it is satisfying to note that six new Urea plants have since been set up each having an annual production capacity of 12.7 LMT thereby adding Urea production capacity of 76.2 LMT per annum.

UNIFIED PAYMENTS INTERFACE (UPI)
The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has approved Paytm to onboard new UPI users, subject to adherence to all procedural guidelines and circulars, according to the company.
The move is expected to come as a relief to Paytm, which had suffered a blow following the Reserve Bank of India’s restrictions earlier this year on associate company Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) in onboarding new UPI users on the Paytm app.
Unified Payments Interface (UPI):
It was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016 and built over Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) infrastructure.
It powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features e.g., transfer of funds, etc.
It is designed to enable peer-to-peer inter-bank transfers through a single two-click factor authentication process.
Features of Unified Payments Interface (UPI):
It simplifies transfers using the recipient’s UPI ID, be it a mobile number, QR code, or Virtual Payment Address, eliminating account numbers.
Earlier, only the deposited amount could be transacted through the UPI System. But now using the credit line on UPI enables pre-sanctioned credit lines from banks via UPI.
It eliminates the need to enter bank details or other sensitive information each time a customer initiates a transaction.
It enhances cross-operability, enabling 24/7 transactions.
It uses technologies like the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and the Aadhaar-Enabled Payment System (AEPS) to ensure that payments between accounts go smoothly.
The users can both send and receive money offline through any compatible device that supports Near Field Communication (NFC) using UPI Lite X.
UPI Tap and Pay allows NFC-enabled QR codes at merchants to complete payments, with a single tap without entering the PIN.
Concerns/Issues/Challenges associated with UPI:
Expanding UPI to accommodate a global user base will require adhering to data protection, financial laws, and regulations of different countries posing regulatory and compliance challenges.
The recent Parliamentary panel’s report, titled ‘Digital Payment and Online Security Measures for Data Protection’ highlighted that foreign entities like PhonePe and Google Pay dominate the Indian fintech sector. For example, the market share of PhonePe is 46.91% and Google Pay is 36.39% in terms of the transaction volume in October-November 2023, whereas for BHIM UPI it is 0.22%.
UPI faces various threats by cybercriminals who may exploit vulnerabilities in the system or use social engineering techniques to gain access to sensitive information leading to financial losses.
UPI poses a significant challenge for cross-border transactions that includes managing currency conversion and exchange rates while facilitating payments and loading money into the wallet.
UPI remains a barrier to its widespread adoption especially among individuals with a lack of familiarity with digital payments, leading to financial fraud.

**********Tackle the issue of adjournments, case pendency
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to case pendency;
Why in the News?
President Droupadi Murmu has called for an end to court delays. In the District Judiciary Conference, she said that frequent postponements make it hard for poor and rural people to seek justice, as they worry cases will take too long to resolve.
Primary Causes of Case Pendency and Frequent Adjournments in Indian Courts:
Judge-Population Ratio:
India has a low judge-to-population ratio, with only
21 judges per million people
as of 2024, far below the Law Commission’s recommended 50 per million.
Vacant Judicial Positions:
Delays in filling judicial vacancies lead to understaffed courts, with 30% vacancies in High Courts, adding pressure on the existing judges.
Additional Judicial Charges:
Judges often handle multiple courts or specialized responsibilities, detracting from their ability to focus on primary cases and adding to delays.
Complex Case Load:
Courts are burdened by multiple types of cases, including civil, criminal, constitutional, and appeals, many of which end up in higher courts, leading to severe backlogs.
Lack of Judicial-Impact Assessment:
New laws increase the caseload, but without assessing the impact on court infrastructure, staffing, and resources, exacerbating delays.
Delay in Witness Availability:
Witnesses are often not available on time, which postpones court hearings and impacts trial timelines.
How can technology be leveraged to reduce case pendency?
Digitization of Case Records:
Electronic records reduce administrative delays in case filing, retrieval, and transfer between courts.
AI-Powered Case Management Systems:
AI can assist in case prioritization, track progress, and predict possible delays, enabling judges and clerks to streamline schedules more effectively.
E-Courts and Video Conferencing:
Virtual hearings can expedite proceedings, especially for remote cases or minor disputes, saving travel and scheduling time.
Automation of Routine Processes:
Automating administrative tasks like case status updates, notifications, and scheduling can reduce clerical delays and improve transparency for litigants.
Data Analytics for Judicial Insights:
Predictive analytics can help in understanding case patterns, enabling policymakers to make data-driven decisions on judicial staffing and resources.
What reforms are necessary to improve judicial efficiency and reduce backlog? (Way forward)
Filling Vacancies and Enhancing Judge Numbers:
Quick action on filling judicial vacancies is critical, along with increasing sanctioned positions to meet the demands of the population and growing caseload.
Implementing Judicial-Impact Assessments:
Adopting the recommendations of the Justice M. Jagannadha Rao Committee for pre-legislative impact assessment would ensure adequate resources accompany new laws.
Expanding Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR):
Scaling up mediation centers and incentivizing ADR methods can resolve disputes outside court, decreasing the burden on the judiciary.
Dedicated Special Courts:
Establishing well-staffed, specialized courts for specific categories (e.g., economic offenses, family disputes) would help reduce strain on regular courts.
No Additional Charge Policy for Judges:
Assigning a single focus area per judge ensures concentration on cases without undue burdens, leading to higher efficiency and better judgment quality.
Periodic Judicial Training:
Regular training on case management and technological tools can empower judges and court staff to adapt to evolving needs, reducing inefficiencies.
**********SC ruling on child marriage: why it’s important to go beyond just punishment
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Population Issues; Cultural issues in the Society; Child marriage;
Why in the News?
In the recent judgment of
Society for
Enlightenment and Voluntary Action v. Union of India
, the SC has shifted the focus in child marriage cases from punishing criminal acts to addressing the
“harm inflicted on the victim.”
What is the law on Child Marriage?
Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA)
: Defines child marriage as one where the husband is under 21 years or the wife is under 18.
Such marriages are
voidable
: The underage person can choose to cancel the marriage, but until they do, it is still legally recognized.
State Variations
: In
Karnataka
Haryana
, child marriages are void
from the beginning
, without the need for annulment.
Annulment vs. Divorce
: Annulment treats the marriage as if it never took place, while divorce ends an existing marriage. To get an annulment under the PCMA, it only needs to be shown that
one person
was
underage at the time
Why are there concerns about using criminal action to tackle child marriage?
Although the marriage remains valid unless annulled,
related activities are criminalized
PCMA, BNS,
POCSO,
such as promoting or performing child marriages and sexual activity with a minor.
Criminal provisions can lead to charges against the
girl’s family members
(parents, husband, in-laws), leaving her without support and creating barriers to accessing
sexual and reproductive healthcare
Studies reveal criminal provisions are used more in
self-initiated marriages
than arranged ones, overlooking the complexities of these cases.
Some adolescents may
choose marriage to escape abusive environments
or forced marriage, often seeing it as a way to assert their agency in a restrictive society.
Why is the SC judgment significant?
Social and Economic Barriers
: Women who leave child marriages often face significant social and economic penalties. The SC judgment proposes
skill development, vocational training, economic stability programs
, rehabilitation services, and victim compensation to support them.
Empowering Women in Child Marriages
: Some women prefer to remain married but need support to advocate for themselves. The judgment calls for tools to help them make decisions about reproductive rights, employment, and education.
Sex Education for Adolescents
: The judgment emphasizes sex education, equipping young people with skills and knowledge to navigate relationships and improve agency.
Holistic Approach
: By moving away from solely criminal prosecution to focus on empowerment and support, the SC judgment provides a more comprehensive, agency-affirming response to child marriage.
Way forward:
Strengthen Support Systems:
Develop targeted programs for
skill training, financial assistance,
to help individuals exit child marriages, promoting economic stability and social reintegration.
Enhance Education and Awareness:
Implement comprehensive sex education and awareness initiatives in communities to empower young individuals and discourage child marriage through informed decision-making and better access to reproductive rights.
Mains PYQ:
“Empowering women is the key to controlling the population growth.” Discuss.
(UPSC IAS/2019)
Customs and traditions suppress reason leading to obscurantism. Do you agree?

**********Misuse of EPR legislation worsening India’s plastic problem, shows CSE report
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to EPR;
Why in the News?
The Indian government’s 2022
“Extended Producer Responsibility”
guidelines mark progress, but a recent report states that stronger measures are needed to fully enforce the
“polluter pays”
principle in plastic waste management, per a recent CSE report.
What is the CSE report?
A CSE report is a publication by the
Centre for Science and Environment
(CSE)
, a prominent Delhi-based think tank focused on environmental research and advocacy.
CSE reports analyze pressing
environmental issues
, often providing data-driven insights and policy recommendations.
What is Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)?
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy approach where producers are given significant
financial
and sometimes
operational responsibility
for the treatment or disposal of post-consumer products.
The primary goal of EPR is to make manufacturers accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, especially in terms of environmental impact, by ensuring that they take part in the collection, recycling, and disposal processes.
Extent of the misuse of EPR certificates in India’s plastic recycling industry
Fake Certificates
: An assessment by the
Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)
and findings from the
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
revealed the generation of over 700,000 fake recycling certificates, indicating widespread fraud among plastic recyclers.
Certificate Inflation
: Some processors and recyclers reported volumes vastly exceeding their registered capacities.
For example, cement plants engaged in end-of-life co-processing claimed to process
335.4 million tonnes annually
, despite an actual capacity of
only 11.4 million tonnes.
Undermined Trust
: Fraudulent activities result in artificially low certificate prices, undermining the
credibility of the EPR system
and making it difficult to accurately track plastic waste management.
How does this impact environmental compliance and plastic waste management?
Underreported Waste Generation
: PIBOs introduced
23.9 million tonnes of plastic
packaging in April 2022, translating to an annual waste generation of approximately 8 million tonnes. However, CPCB’s estimate of
4.1 million tonnes of plastic waste generation
annually indicates significant underreporting.
Limited Stakeholder Participation
: The absence of key contributors, such as
urban local bodies
informal waste collectors
, reduces traceability and leaves much of the waste management burden on local governments.
Compromised Recycling Integrity
: Due to low-cost fraudulent certificates, genuine recycling efforts suffer from underfunding and inadequate regulation, jeopardizing sustainable plastic waste management efforts and hindering the implementation of the
principle.
What measures can be implemented to improve oversight and accountability within the EPR framework?
Inclusion of Informal Sector
: Recognizing and formalizing the role of informal waste collectors and urban local bodies within the EPR framework could enhance waste collection, segregation, and recycling rates, creating a more transparent value chain.
Combatting Fraud
: Strengthening the auditing and certification process to identify and remove fraudulent recyclers and processors, supported by stricter legal and financial penalties, would help deter misuse.
Transparent Reporting
: Enhancing the EPR portal to ensure accurate data collection on plastic waste generation and disposal, and setting fair prices for recycling certificates to prevent undervaluation.
Standardizing Products
: By mandating uniform standards for plastic packaging materials and designs, recyclability could be improved, reducing contamination and making recycling more effective.
Enhanced Monitoring and Accountability
: Strengthening CPCB and State Pollution Control Boards’ (SPCBs) monitoring capacity and ensuring consistent enforcement of guidelines at both the state and central levels.
