**********Selenium
Medical experts have linked cases of sudden hair loss affecting 279 people in Maharashtra's Buldhana district to high selenium content found in wheat supplied through local ration shops from Punjab and Haryana.
About Selenium:
It is a
mineral found
in the soil and
naturally appears in water and some foods.
Soil and ground water contain
inorganic forms of selenium
that plants accumulate and convert to organic forms, mostly
selenomethionine
selenocysteine
and their
methylated derivatives
Selenium is a constituent of
25 selenoproteins
, including thioredoxin reductases, glutathione peroxidases, and selenoprotein P.
Selenoproteins play critical roles in
thyroid hormone metabolism, DNA synthesis
, reproduction, and protection from oxidative damage and infection.
Human body
cannot produce selenium
on its own but needs only a small amount of it.
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of selenium for adult men and women 19+ years of age is 55 micrograms daily. Women who are pregnant and lactating need about 60 and 70 micrograms daily, respectively.
Food Sources of selenium:
Protein rich foods from animals are generally good sources of selenium.
Seafoods, organ meats, and Brazil nuts
are the foods highest in selenium.

**********Black Plastic
Black Plastic made headlines as a recent study claimed that the material contained toxic flame retardants which could be leaching into food at hazardous levels.
About Black Plastic:
It is a type of plastic
used to make everyday items
like food trays, containers, and utensils.
It is often
made from recycled electronic
waste such as
computers, TVs and appliances.
These are more likely to contain unregulated amounts
of toxic chemicals including heavy metals and flame retardants.
The issue is that these electronics typically contain substances such as the
flame retardant bromine
;
antimony; and heavy metals
such as lead, cadmium, and mercury.
Impact on human health:
The aforementioned substances and heavy metals are known to be
toxic to humans at high levels
of exposure.
Children are particularly vulnerable
as they often come into prolonged contact with toys that could expose them to harmful chemicals through direct handling or ingestion.
Toxic chemicals in black plastic kitchen utensils could
leach into food during heating
, compounding the risk of exposure for households using these products regularly.
Studies have shown that chemicals in black plastic, such
as BPA and phthalates, disrupt the endocrine system,
leading to potential reproductive health issues, obesity, and diabetes.

**********Spinal Muscular Atrophy
Recently, clinical neuroscientists said that they have managed to treat a deadly motor neuron disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in a baby who was still in the womb.
About Spinal Muscular Atrophy:
It is a
debilitating genetic condition
which
affects motor neurons
that control movement, and leads to progressive muscle weakening.
Types of SMA:
There are five subtypes of SMA - Type 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Healthcare providers classify them based on the age of onset, as well as the severity and life expectancy.
Symptoms:
Its symptoms vary and
may be mild or disabling
, but involve a weakness of the muscles that control movement. Involuntary muscles are not affected, such as those in the heart, blood vessels and digestive tract.
The weakness in SMA tends to be more severe in the muscles that are close to the center of the body than in the muscles farther away from the body’s center.
Causes:
The condition is caused by
mutations in the survival motor neuron gene
(SMN1)
which causes a deficiency of a protein crucial for the survival of motor neurons in the spinal cord.
This prevents muscles from receiving signals from the brain, causing them to waste away.
Prevalence:
About one in every 10,000 births has some form of the condition — making it a leading genetic cause of death in infants and children.
Treatment:
Unfortunately, there
isn’t a cure for SMA
. Treatment for SMA mainly seeks to manage symptoms and prevent complications.
Symptom management therapies may include:
Physical therapy, which can help improve posture, prevent joint immobility and slow muscle weakness.

**********Significance of Tea Horse Road Connecting India – China
Why in the News?
China’s Ambassador to India
Xu Feihong
posted on X (Twitter) about the historic Tea Horse Road which spanned more than 2,000 km, and connected China to India via Tibet.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Tea Horse Road (Historical Background, Utility, Role in Modern History, Revival, etc.)
Introduction:
The
, an ancient trade network connecting
China, Tibet, and India
, played a key role in commerce and cultural exchange for centuries.
While less famous than the
Silk Road
, this route facilitated the movement of
tea, horses, and other valuable commodities
across some of the world's most challenging terrains.
Recently, China’s
Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong
, highlighted the historical significance of the Tea Horse Road, emphasizing its role in strengthening India-China ties through history.
Origins of the Tea Horse Road:
The Tea Horse Road traces its origins to the
Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE)
, when trade between Southwest China, Tibet, and India first flourished.
Buddhist monk Yijing (635-713 CE)
documented early trade exchanges, mentioning the movement of goods such as
sugar, textiles, and rice noodles from China
, while
horses, Tibetan gold, saffron, and medicinal herbs
were exported.
By the
10th century
, during the
Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE)
, official markets were established along the route to regulate the trade of
tea and horses
, which became the dominant commodities exchanged between China and Tibet.
A Network of Roads Across Difficult Terrain:
The Tea Horse Road was not a single pathway, but a network of trails originating in Southwest China and reaching deep into the Indian subcontinent, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
Key Features of the Route:
Length
: Over
Key Cities
: Passed through
Dali, Lijiang (Yunnan Province), and Lhasa (Tibet)
Elevation
: Reached up to
10,000 feet
in the Himalayas
Challenges
: Harsh terrain, extreme weather, and high altitudes made the journey perilous for traders
Despite these difficulties, traders travelled extensively, carrying tea from Sichuan to Tibet and India, while returning with horses and other essential goods.
Tea and Horses – The Core of the Trade:
Tea was a
necessity for Tibetan nomads
, who lived in
cold and harsh climates
. According to National Geographic, yak butter tea became a staple for Tibetans, providing essential warmth and energy.
Meanwhile, horses were
crucial for China’s military
. Since the
central plains of China lacked horses
, they had to be imported from Tibet and Yunnan.
Tibetan steeds became highly valued
, particularly in China’s conflicts against Mongolian tribes.
To regulate this exchange, China’s
Song Dynasty government established official markets
, ensuring a controlled trade of tea and horses, which contributed to regional economic stability.
The Road’s Role in Modern History:
Expansion of Trade in the Early 20th Century
With the
fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912
, the Tea Horse Road became even more vital.
Yunnan’s tea industry expanded
as China integrated into the global market.
New trade techniques and goods were introduced to the mountainous regions, increasing economic opportunities.
World War II and the Road’s Strategic Importance
During
Japan controlled much of China’s coastline
, the Tea Horse Road served as an alternative supply route for transporting goods and military supplies to China’s resistance forces.
Decline After the Founding of the People's Republic of China (1949)
Following the establishment of the
People’s Republic of China
, the importance of the Tea Horse Road declined.
Mao Zedong’s land reforms
significantly changed trade patterns, and with the advancement of modern transportation, the historic trade route lost its relevance.
However, some remnants remain, particularly in regions like
, which became a
UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997
due to its historical significance in trade.
Revival of the Tea Horse Road as a Cultural Landmark:
In recent years, China has promoted tourism along the ancient trade route, highlighting its historical importance.
The city of
Lijiang, once a crucial trade hub
, has been transformed into a cultural and heritage site, drawing visitors from across the world.
According to UNESCO, Lijiang was an important distribution center for trade between
Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet
, where it intersected with southern Silk Road routes. Today, the city serves as a testament to the Tea Horse Road’s enduring legacy.
Conclusion:
The Tea Horse Road was more than just a trade route; it was a
lifeline connecting China, Tibet, and India
for centuries. While its significance has diminished in modern times, it remains a historical and cultural symbol of international exchange.
Today, efforts to preserve its legacy through tourism and research highlight its role in shaping the economic and cultural landscapes of the regions it once traversed. The renewed focus on this historic route serves as a reminder of the deep historical ties between India and China.

**********Reducing Employer Compliance Burden - A Roadmap for State Governments
Context:
State governments impose a significant compliance burden on employers, accounting for 80% of criminal provisions, 65% of filings, and 63% of total compliances.
Chief Ministers (CMs) can improve the business environment through
three key reforms:
Decriminalisation, Digitisation, and Rationalisation.
These reforms can help
boost high-wage employment and foster economic growth
Decriminalisation of Employer Compliance:
The current scenario:
India has 26,134 employer-related jail provisions, of which 80% can be removed by state governments.
The Jan Vishwas Bill
eliminated only 110 out of 5,239 central employer jail provisions due to
bureaucratic inertia and vested interests.
Recommended approach:
CMs should adopt a “
reversing the gaze
” approach, removing criminal provisions
except in cases
involving:
Physical harm to individuals.
Intentional fraud against stakeholders.
Major societal externalities affecting public order, national integrity, or property rights.
Vague general clauses that do not specify crimes clearly.
Procedural infractions like delays or inaccuracies in filings, incorrect formats, and calculation errors.
The upcoming Jan Vishwas 2.0
could eliminate another 40% of employer-related criminal provisions.
States like
Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu
have made small reforms, while Gujarat, Karnataka, and Odisha are considering changes.
Digitisation for Simplified Compliance:
The need for digital transformation:
65% of India’s 69,233 employer compliances can be made paperless, presence-less, and cashless.
Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)
has already transformed areas like vaccine certification, toll payments, de-duplicated welfare records, and payments.
For example
RBI’s initial UPI target
of a billion monthly transactions has now been revised to a billion daily transactions.
Recent announcements on
PAN 2.0 and the Entity Locker
(a single source of truth, tamper-proof, and authenticated document repository for all government-issued licenses, registrations, and permissions).
Proposed solutions:
State Employer Compliance Grids (
SECGs
) should be implemented, replicating DPI’s open-architecture technology for:
Filing periodic returns.
Issuing licences, registrations, and NOCs.
Ensuring a single-source, tamper-proof repository for compliance documents.
SECGs can be operational in 180 days and should
integrate with national initiatives.
Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh
are in the early stages of adopting SECGs.
Rationalisation of Governance and Compliance Frameworks:
Challenges in bureaucratic structures:
India’s state civil service has become
rigid and inefficient
, often prioritizing prohibition over permission and guilt over innocence.
Excessive bureaucracy:
Number of government departments in some states:
UP (72), Uttarakhand (63), Assam (54), Punjab (51), MP (47), Maharashtra (35), Andhra Pradesh (31), Gujarat (27).
Comparatively, developed nations operate with fewer ministries:
Japan (15), UK (22), US (25).
Way forward:
Simplifying governance structures:
By consolidating departments can enhance efficiency.
Decentralisation of policy-making:
PM Modi’s idea that 29 CMs matter more than one PM aligns with philosopher Karl Polanyi’s view that
markets are shaped by social, political, and economic factors.
Conclusion:
India’s economic challenge lies in “
employed poverty
”, with too many people in
low-productivity jobs
CMs can accelerate reforms
by removing unnecessary compliance hurdles, enabling businesses to flourish and generate higher wages.
As Daniel Kahneman (Nobel Prize-winning economist) suggests, sometimes
the best way to accelerate progress is not by stepping on the accelerator but by removing the brakes
- a principle CMs should embrace for economic transformation.

**********Fencing Out Interfaith Relationships in the New India
Context
On January 27, 2025
Uttarakhand became the first Indian state
to implement the
Uniform Civil Code (UCC).
While its
proponents claim that it aims to promote gender justice
, uniformity, and administrative efficiency,
its broader implications suggest a legal framework that places personal relationships under state surveillance.
Amid these developments, it is
crucial to explore how the UCC, in conjunction with anti-conversion laws, curtails personal freedoms
, strengthens patriarchal control, and institutionalizes segregation in contemporary India.
Challenges Faced by the Interfaith Relationships in India
Interfaith marriages in India already face immense social and legal challenges.
A 2014 survey of over 70,000 respondents revealed that
fewer than 10% of urban Indians had a family member who married outside their caste,
and only 5% reported interfaith marriages within their families.
Existing laws such as the
Special Marriage Act, 1954
, require a 30-day public notice period, making interfaith couples vulnerable to scrutiny and harassment.
The
situation has worsened with anti-conversion laws
in states like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Rajasthan.
These laws
impose bureaucratic barriers
, including mandatory declarations, waiting periods, and district magistrate approvals.
impact of these regulations is
not just procedural but deeply social
, emboldening vigilante groups linked to right-wing organisations.
A study found that
in Uttar Pradesh, 63 out of 101 police complaints filed under the anti-conversion law against Christians
originated from
third-party vigilante groups.
Instead of safeguarding individual rights,
these laws provide legal backing for extrajudicial policing of personal choices.
State Surveillance and the Criminalization of Live-in Relationships
UCC extends state control beyond formal marriages
, reaching into informal relationships.
It mandates that
live-in relationships be registered with district authorities
, requiring couples to submit a 16-page application along with identity proofs.
process includes seeking approval from religious leaders or community heads
, notifying family members, and subjecting couples to scrutiny.
Non-compliance is criminalised
, carrying a penalty of up to
six months of imprisonment and a ₹25,000 fine.
Such measures
disproportionately affect interfaith couples
, who often seek privacy due to social pressures.
Reports indicate
that only one couple has successfully registered their live-in relationship in Uttarakhand,
while others have turned to the High Court for protection.
Broader Implications:
Empowering Religious Institutions in a Secular State
By requiring religious certification for marriage or conversion,
the UCC formalises the authority of religious leaders over personal relationships.
This contradicts India's constitutional guarantees of individual freedom and secularism, reinforcing the idea that
personal relationships must conform to religious and community norms rather than personal choice.
Enhancing Familial Control Over Women
The legal requirement to notify families of live-in relationships
places women at heightened risk of coercion,
honour-based violence, and forced separation.
Patriarchal narratives often depict women
in interfaith relationships
as victims of manipulation,
further limiting their agency.
These legal frameworks thus reinforce family and community control over women’s autonomy.
Legitimising Vigilantism
Extremists’ groups now have legal avenues to monitor and intervene
in interfaith relationships.
Public notices and family notifications allow these groups to track and harass couples
, often under the pretence of upholding tradition.
Instead of protecting individuals,
these laws provide a legal shield for extrajudicial policing,
increasing communal tensions.
A Dangerous Precedent: The Spread of the UCC Model
Uttarakhand’s implementation of the UCC
is not an isolated incident but a potential model for other states.
Rajasthan’s High Court has proposed similar live-in relationship registration
requirements, and the state has already enacted an anti-conversion law.
Gujarat is also considering a draft UCC
based on Uttarakhand’s framework.
trend suggests a coordinated effort to regulate personal relationships
through legal mechanisms, threatening India’s pluralistic traditions.
Conclusion
The implementation of the UCC in Uttarakhand,
alongside existing anti-conversion laws, represents an
unprecedented level of state interference
in personal relationships.
By bureaucratising interfaith unions,
strengthening religious authority, curtailing women's freedoms, and legitimizing vigilantism,
these laws erode individual rights and deepen communal divisions.
If similar policies are adopted in other states,
India risks institutionalising social segregation, undermining the very principles of democracy and personal liberty.

**********The RTI is Now the ‘Right to Deny Information’
Context
Right to Information (RTI) Act
was introduced with the objective of enhancing transparency and empowering citizens by
granting them access to government-held information.
It was
perceived as a means to uphold democratic principles
by ensuring accountability and reducing corruption.
However,
despite its initial promise, the Act has encountered numerous challenges,
resulting in a diminished impact.
Therefore,
it is important to examine the trajectory of the RTI Act, the systemic issues that have weakened its implementation, and the legal interpretations
that have further restricted citizens’ access to information.
The Initial Promise of the RTI Act
The RTI Act
was seen as a landmark piece of legislation
that recognized citizens as the true rulers of the nation.
By codifying the fundamental right to information,
the Act provided an effective tool for public oversight,
allowing people to monitor the functioning of the government.
This
empowerment was expected to curb corruption and arbitrariness
, leading to a more transparent and accountable administration.
law was hailed as one of the best transparency laws in the world,
offering a legal framework for citizens to seek information with dignity and respect.
the optimism surrounding the Act quickly diminished as the government and bureaucracy resisted this shift in power.
Systematic Issues and Judicial Interpretations that Weakened the RTI Act
Bureaucratic Resistance and Systemic Erosion
One of the earliest challenges to the RTI Act was
the reluctance of government officials to relinquish control over information.
Recognising that the Act effectively transferred power from public servants to citizens,
the government attempted to weaken the law through amendments.
strong public opposition forced it to abandon these efforts
. Despite this, a gradual erosion of the Act’s effectiveness ensued through bureaucratic resistance and judicial reinterpretations.
implementation of the Act was entrusted to Information Commissions
, which functioned as appellate authorities.
Unfortunately,
most of the commissioners appointed were retired bureaucrats,
many of whom viewed these positions as post-retirement sinecures rather than opportunities to uphold transparency.
Their reluctance to impose penalties for non-compliance further weakened the Act.
Additionally,
delays in appointing commissioners led to massive backlogs,
rendering the right to information ineffective.
The mandated 30-day period for providing information was often not adhered to,
turning RTI into a tool that provided historical records rather than timely insights.
Judicial Interpretations Restricting RTI
Central Board of Secondary Education vs Aditya Bandopadhyay (2011)
A significant shift in the interpretation of the RTI Act
occurred with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Central Board of Secondary Education vs Aditya Bandopadhyay (2011).
judgment challenged the strict interpretation of Section 8,
which outlines
exemptions to the right to information.
Court’s assertion that indiscriminate use of RTI could hinder administrative efficiency
and national development introduced a restrictive view of the law.
perspective justified the denial of information
on broad grounds and cast suspicion on RTI applicants, l
eading to an environment where transparency was seen as an obstruction
rather than a fundamental right.
Girish Ramchandra Deshpande vs Central Information Commissioner (2012)
The erosion of the RTI Act continued with the Supreme Court’s decision in
Girish Ramchandra Deshpande vs Central Information Commissioner (2012).
In this case,
the Court ruled that information about a public servant’s disciplinary records and financial dealings was ‘personal information’
and therefore
exempt under Section 8(1)(j).
judgment did not fully consider whether the information was related to a public activity
or if its disclosure was in the larger public interest.
By narrowly interpreting the law,
the Court set a precedent that allowed authorities to withhold crucial information,
effectively converting the RTI into a Right to Deny Information (RDI).
interpretation has been cited in multiple subsequent rulings,
further restricting transparency.
The Implications of a Weakening RTI Act
Reduced Government Accountability and Transparency
core objectives of the RTI Act was to make the government more transparent
and accountable to the public.
By allowing citizens to seek information on governmental decisions, policies, and expenditures,
the Act aimed to ensure that public officials remained answerable
for their actions.
the increasing reluctance of Information Commissions to impose penalties
, the excessive delays in providing information,
and judicial restrictions on disclosure have made it easier for authorities to evade scrutiny.
For example,
the SC’s ruling in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande vs Central Information Commissioner (2012) set a precedent that allows government officials to withhold crucial information
by classifying it as “personal.”
significantly reduces public oversight
over government functionaries, making it easier for misconduct, inefficiency, and corruption to go unchecked.
Increase in Corruption and Misuse of Public Funds
A strong RTI framework acts as a deterrent against corruption by ensuring that public officials are aware that their actions are subject to scrutiny.
When the implementation of the RTI Act is weakened,
corrupt practices become easier to hide.
Government contracts, public procurement processes, and financial allocations, areas where corruption is most prevalent, become opaquer
, allowing misappropriation of public funds without fear of exposure.
For instance,
activists have used RTI to uncover major scams in the past
, such as the Adarsh Housing Society scam and
the Vyapam scam.
Hindrance to Investigative Journalism and Public Awareness
The RTI Act has been
a critical tool for journalists and researchers who rely on access to government data
to investigate issues of public interest.
Many major news stories and investigative reports have been based on information
obtained through RTI applications.
However, as government departments and Information Commissions become more reluctant to disclose information,
the ability of journalists to report on corruption, policy failures, and governance issues is severely affected.
The Way Forward: A Call for Citizen Vigilance
To safeguard the integrity of the RTI Act,
active citizen participation is essential.
Public awareness and media discourse must highlight attempts to dilute the Act
and push for reforms that restore its effectiveness.
Information Commissions must be strengthened
by appointing independent and competent officials with a commitment to transparency.
the legal framework must be reviewed
to ensure that exemptions under Section 8
are interpreted in a manner that prioritizes public interest over bureaucratic convenience.
Conclusion
While the RTI Act was initially seen as a powerful tool to uphold transparency and democracy,
its effectiveness has been steadily eroded by bureaucratic resistance
, judicial restrictions, and legislative amendments.
The shift from an era of optimism to one of scepticism underscores the challenges
in maintaining government accountability.
the responsibility to preserve the essence of the RTI Act lies with the citizens and media,
who must actively defend their fundamental right to information.

Editorial Analysis
**********Strategy on Fertilizers
Why in news?
India aims to cap or reduce the consumption of urea, di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and muriate of potash (MOP) due to their heavy reliance on imports.
What’s in today’s article?
India’s Dependence on Imported Fertilisers
Need to Limit the Usage of Urea, MOP, and DAP
An Effective Replacement for DAP: Ammonium Phosphate Sulphate (APS)
The Road Ahead
: Fully imported from Canada, Russia, Jordan, Israel, Turkmenistan, and Belarus due to the lack of domestic potash reserves.
: Over 85% of demand met domestically, but production depends on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar, the US, UAE, and Angola.
: imported in the form of
finished fertiliser (mainly from Saudi Arabia, China, Morocco, Russia and Jordan) as well as
raw material (rock phosphate from Jordan, Morocco, Togo, Egypt and Algeria; sulphur from UAE, Qatar and Oman) and
intermediate chemicals (phosphoric acid from Jordan, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia; ammonia from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Indonesia).
High Import Dependence and Currency Depreciation
India heavily relies on imports for MOP and DAP, while urea production depends on imported LNG.
The rupee’s depreciation further increases the cost of these fertilisers, putting pressure on foreign exchange reserves.
Imbalance in Nutrient Application
Urea (46% nitrogen), MOP (60% potash), and DAP (46% phosphorus + 18% nitrogen) are high-analysis fertilisers.
Most crops do not require such high concentrations of individual nutrients, leading to inefficient nutrient absorption and wastage.
Need for Balanced Fertilisation
Crops require a mix of macronutrients (N, P, K), secondary nutrients (sulphur, calcium, magnesium), and micronutrients (zinc, iron, copper, boron, manganese, molybdenum).
Excessive use of high-analysis fertilisers disrupts soil health and reduces long-term productivity.
Efficient Use of Resources and Foreign Exchange
Reducing dependence on high-analysis fertilisers ensures better utilisation of imported raw materials.
Balanced fertilisation promotes sustainable farming, enhances crop yields, and reduces unnecessary expenditure on imports.
APS (20:20:0:13) contains
20% nitrogen (N), 20% phosphorus (P), and 13% sulphur (S)
but no potassium (K).
Despite having lower phosphorus content than DAP (which has 46% P), APS is an effective alternative due to its balanced nutrient composition.
APS manufacturing reduces dependence on costly phosphoric acid, making fertiliser production
more economical and resource-efficient
The inclusion of sulphur improves soil health and enhances crop yield, making APS a
viable and sustainable alternative to DAP
APS is ideal for
oilseeds, pulses, maize, cotton, onion, and chilli
, which require high sulphur content.
DAP should be reserved for wheat, rice, and sugarcane, where it is most essential.
Also, companies benefit by selling twice the number of APS bags from the same phosphoric acid quantity, making APS a more financially viable option.
Surge in NPKS Complex Fertiliser Sales
NPKS fertiliser sales in 2024-25 are projected to reach 14 mt, nearly double the 7.3 mt in 2013-14.
The rapid growth is largely driven by 20:20:0:13, which is steadily replacing DAP.
Expanding the Push for Balanced Fertilisation
Other complex fertilisers like 10:26:26:0, 12:32:16:0, 15:15:15:0, and 14:35:14:0 need stronger marketing efforts.
Direct application of MOP should be minimised, with its usage integrated into balanced complex fertilisers.
Reducing Dependence on High-Analysis Fertilisers
The long-term goal is to limit or reduce the use of urea, DAP, and MOP, ensuring efficient nutrient application.
Farmers should be encouraged to maximize nutrient use efficiency, leading to better crop productivity while conserving foreign exchange.

**********What ails India’s textile industry
Why in news?
is one of the largest globally, covering the entire value chain from cotton cultivation to apparel manufacturing. However, it lags behind China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh in exports due to fragmented supply chains, higher costs, and complex regulations.
Despite being a major producer of cotton and synthetic fibres, the industry has seen slow growth. Rising sustainability and compliance requirements are expected to further increase costs, particularly for smaller firms.
What’s in today’s article?
India’s Textile Journey: From Fibre to Fabric
India’s Textile and Apparel Industry: Growth and Export Trends
India’s Textile Export Challenges
The Sustainability Challenge in India’s Textile Industry
Cotton Production and Employment
India is the
second-largest cotton producer
globally, contributing 24% of global production.
Cotton farming involves around 60 lakh farmers, primarily in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Telangana.
The cotton textile value chain, from fibre processing to garment manufacturing, employs over 4.5 crore people.
Man-Made Fibre (MMF) Industry
India is also the
second-largest producer of MMF
, with Reliance Industries leading in polyester and Grasim Industries being the sole domestic producer of viscose.
However, MMF consumption in India remains low at 3.1 kg per capita, compared to 12 kg in China and 22.5 kg in North America.
Overall fibre consumption, including natural and synthetic fibres, is 5.5 kg per capita, below the global average of 11.2 kg.
MSME Clusters and Specialisations
Around 80% of India's textile value chain operates within MSME clusters, each specializing in different textiles:
Bhiwandi (Maharashtra) – Fabric production
Tiruppur (Tamil Nadu) – T-shirts and undergarments
Surat (Gujarat) – Polyester and nylon fabrics
Ludhiana (Punjab) – Woolen garments
India’s textile and apparel sector is a key economic driver, contributing
13% to industrial production, 12% to exports, and 2% to GDP
However, manufacturing growth has slowed over the past decade.
Growth trends
Between FY15 and FY19, the textile sector grew at a CAGR of 0.4%, while apparel grew at
7.7%
From FY20 to FY24, the industry contracted, with textiles shrinking by
1.8% annually
and apparel by
8.2%
, largely due to post-pandemic economic challenges.
Export Performance and Key Markets
Despite a trade surplus, textile and apparel exports have seen sluggish growth.
In FY24, exports stood at $34.1 billion, slightly up from $33.4 billion in FY20.
Nearly 50% of exports were to the U.S. and EU, serving brands like JCPenney, Gap, and Decathlon.
Sector-Wise Export Trends
Garment and Apparel Exports
– Declined from $15.5 billion in FY20 to $14.5 billion in FY24.
Cotton Textiles and Home Textiles
– Grew from $10.2 billion in FY20 to $12.3 billion in FY24, with key players like Welspun Living and Trident Ltd.
Challenges for MSMEs
The slowdown has hit MSME clusters, especially in Tamil Nadu, due to global and domestic economic headwinds, impacting production and exports.
Lagging Behind Competitors
India trails China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh in textile exports due to higher production costs and a fragmented supply chain.
In contrast, Vietnam exported $40 billion worth of apparel in 2023, benefiting from vertically integrated supply chains that lower manufacturing costs.
Fragmented Cotton Supply Chain
India's cotton supply chain is spread across multiple states, increasing logistical costs and hindering large-scale production.
The lack of localisation makes production costlier compared to fibre-to-fashion firms in China and Vietnam, which offer low-cost, high-quality, and adaptable exports.
Regulatory and Trade Barriers
Competitor nations benefit from free trade agreements (FTAs) and
simpler customs procedures
, reducing regulatory costs.
In contrast, India’s complex export procedures, requiring detailed accounting of every fabric, button, and zipper, increase compliance burdens for exporters.
High Raw Material Costs in MMF Sector
India’s man-made fibre (MMF) sector suffers from high raw material costs.
Quality control orders (QCOs) restrict imports of polyester and viscose fibres, forcing domestic yarn makers to rely on costlier local alternatives.
Growing Global Focus on Sustainability
With global markets tightening compliance norms, Indian manufacturers must increase renewable energy use, improve recycling, and ensure stricter sourcing and traceability.
Rising Costs Due to Sustainable Sourcing
A global shift towards sustainable textiles is increasing production costs.
The EU, which accounts for 20% of India’s textile exports, has implemented 16 new regulations from 2021 to 2024, making it challenging for small enterprises to transition to environmentally friendly production.
The Fast Fashion Waste Crisis
The textile recycling market in India is projected to reach $400 million, while the global market could touch $7.5 billion.
With fashion waste expected to hit 148 million tonnes by 2030, PM Modi highlighted the need for higher recycling efforts, as currently, less than 25% of textile waste is recycled.

**********[25th February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Surveillance capitalism: the power to control personal data
Governance
PYQ Relevance:
) Data security has assumed significant importance in the digitized world due to rising cyber-crimes. The Justice B. N. Srikrishna Committee Report addresses issues related to data security. What, in your view, are the strengths and weaknesses of the Report relating to protection of personal data in cyber space?
(UPSC CSE 2018)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
“ Data security”  (2018),
and the
Impact of digital technology
(2021).
Surveillance capitalism is an economic system where tech companies collect, analyze, and sell personal data to predict and influence behaviour.
This system, described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism (2018), treats human experiences as a resource for profit, similar to how colonialism and industrial capitalism exploited natural and human resources.
Today’s editorial highlights current issues related to surveillance capitalism and its impact. This topic is relevant for GS Paper 2 and 3 in the UPSC Mains.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Recently, surveillance capitalism has depended on turning personal data into a product. It affects people’s privacy and freedom while being closely linked to government surveillance.
What is Surveillance Capitalism?
is an economic system where technology companies collect, analyze, and monetize personal data to predict and influence human behaviour.
This data is often gathered through digital platforms like social media, search engines, and smart devices, often without users’ full awareness.
How does surveillance capitalism rely on the commodification of personal data?
Collection of Personal Data as Raw Material:
Google Search tracks every query a user makes, including location and device information. This data is processed to understand user preferences and behaviour patterns.
Behavioural Prediction for Targeted Advertising:
Companies monetize behavioural data by selling it to advertisers who target users with precision, maximizing ad effectiveness.
Meta (Facebook) monitors user activity across its platforms to deliver highly personalized ads. Users discussing fitness products may soon see ads for gym memberships.
Continuous Data Harvesting Across Devices:
Data is continuously extracted from smart devices, even during routine interactions, deepening the pool of user insights.
Amazon’s Alexa collects voice commands and ambient sounds to refine product recommendations and improve its machine-learning models.
Algorithmic Manipulation to Influence Behaviour:
Algorithms shape user behaviour by curating content that fosters prolonged engagement, increasing ad revenue.
YouTube’s recommendation algorithm analyses watch history to suggest videos that keep users engaged, often promoting content that aligns with their interests or biases.
What are the strong connections between data commodification and state surveillance?
Mass Data Collection Programs:
Governments collaborate with private tech companies to access vast amounts of personal data for surveillance purposes.
Example:
PRISM program
by the
U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)
collected user data from major tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft to monitor global communications.
Legal Mandates for Data Sharing:
Many countries enforce laws requiring digital platforms to share user data with state agencies for national security and law enforcement.
India’s Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021
require platforms to trace the origin of messages, facilitating state surveillance.
Surveillance Technologies Integration:
States use advanced technologies like
facial recognition
AI-driven monitoring
to track citizens’ movements and online activities.
China’s Social Credit System
uses surveillance cameras and digital monitoring to track citizens’ behavior, affecting access to services based on their social scores.
What are the negative impacts of commodifying personal data?
Privacy Erosion:
When personal data is commodified, individuals lose control over their private information, leading to widespread privacy violations.
Social media platforms like Facebook have been criticized for selling user data to third parties, such as Cambridge Analytica, which used it for targeted political advertising without users’ explicit consent.
Exploitation and Manipulation:
Personal data is often used to influence behavior through targeted advertising or algorithmic content curation, exploiting vulnerabilities.
Companies like Google and Amazon use personal data to create highly targeted ads, influencing purchasing decisions and potentially encouraging addictive behaviours.
Increased Risk of Data Breaches:
The collection and trade of personal data raise the likelihood of data breaches, leading to identity theft, financial loss, and other harms.
The Equifax data breach in 2017 exposed the personal information of 147 million people, including Social Security numbers, due to the commodification and storage of sensitive data.
Inequality and Discrimination:
Commodified data can reinforce social and economic inequalities by enabling discriminatory practices, such as price discrimination or exclusion from services.
Insurance companies may use personal data to charge higher premiums to individuals based on their health or lifestyle, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups.
Loss of Autonomy and Trust:
The exploitation of personal data weakens public trust in institutions and reduces individuals’ sense of control over their own information.
The revelation that apps like TikTok collect and share user data with governments or third parties has led to public distrust and concerns about surveillance.
What steps has the Indian government taken?
Data Protection Legislation:
The Indian government enacted the
Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023
, which regulates the collection, processing, and storage of personal data. It mandates user consent, imposes penalties for data breaches, and establishes a
Data Protection Board
to address grievances.
Strengthening Cybersecurity:
Initiatives like the
National Cyber Security Policy (2013)
and the establishment of
CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team)
aim to protect critical information infrastructure, prevent cyberattacks, and enhance data security.
Regulating Big Tech:
The government has introduced guidelines like the
, which require platforms to ensure transparency, allow user grievance redressal, and hold intermediaries accountable for data misuse.
What steps have been taken at the global level?
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), European Union (2018):
sets a global benchmark for data privacy by enforcing strict guidelines on data collection, processing, and storage. It grants individuals the
right to access, correct, and delete
their personal data and imposes
hefty penalties
for non-compliance.
Global Data Protection Frameworks:
OECD Privacy Guidelines
UN’s Internet Governance Forum
promote international cooperation on data privacy, emphasizing
transparency, user consent, and cross-border data flow regulations
The USA’s Sectoral Approach:
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
and similar state-level laws provide
data protection rights
to consumers, including the ability to
opt out of data sales
. The USA also advocates for a
federal privacy law
to harmonize regulations across industries.
Way forward:
Stronger Regulatory Frameworks:
Implement
comprehensive and adaptive data protection laws
with clear accountability for data handlers, regular audits, and stringent penalties to safeguard user privacy and prevent misuse.
User Empowerment and Transparency:
Promote
data literacy programs
and ensure platforms provide
clear, accessible consent mechanisms
, allowing users greater control over their personal information and how it is shared.

**********The RTI is now the ‘Right to Deny Information’
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges to RTI;
Why in the News?
The RTI Act allowed people to question the government, but the government soon tried to weaken it.
Why is the RTI now being viewed as the ‘right to deny information’?
Judicial Interpretations Diluting the Scope of RTI:
Key court judgments, like
Girish Ramchandra Deshpande vs. CIC (2012)
, have expanded the definition of “personal information” under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. This allows authorities to deny information about public servants’ misconduct, assets, and disciplinary records.
Delayed Appointments and Case Backlogs:
Government delays in appointing Information Commissioners have led to massive backlogs, reducing the effectiveness of the RTI. Information is often provided after significant delays, turning it into a “right to history.”
Narrow Interpretation of Public Interest:
The Supreme Court’s ruling in
CBSE vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay (2011)
warned against the “misuse” of RTI for seeking all types of information, limiting disclosures that could allegedly disrupt administrative efficiency.
Example:
Information requests related to public policy decisions are frequently denied on vague grounds of protecting “national integration” or preventing “administrative burden.”
What have been the key achievements of the RTI since its inception?
Increased Transparency and Accountability:
The RTI Act has empowered citizens to hold public authorities accountable by providing access to government records and decisions.
In 2007, RTI applications exposed corruption in the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA), leading to better monitoring and payment transparency.
Exposing Corruption and Misuse of Power:
RTI has played a crucial role in uncovering major scams and irregularities, prompting legal and policy reforms.
The 2G spectrum scam (2008) involving massive financial irregularities in telecom licensing was brought to light through RTI inquiries, leading to the cancellation of 122 telecom licenses by the Supreme Court.
Empowering Marginalized Communities:
Rural and marginalized groups have used RTI to access entitlements like ration cards, pensions, and housing schemes, ensuring their socio-economic rights.
In Rajasthan, villagers used RTI to reveal discrepancies in public distribution system (PDS) records, ensuring access to their rightful food supplies.
What are the limitations of RTI?
Exemptions under Section 8:
Certain categories of information are exempt from disclosure, such as matters related to national security, sovereignty, and personal privacy.
Information related to defense strategies or confidential Cabinet discussions cannot be accessed through RTI.
Delayed or Incomplete Responses:
Bureaucratic delays and lack of accountability often lead to incomplete or delayed information, undermining the RTI’s effectiveness.
In 2021, RTI applications regarding COVID-19 vaccine procurement faced significant delays, limiting public scrutiny during a critical period.
Threats and Intimidation of RTI Activists:
Whistleblowers and activists who use RTI to expose corruption face harassment, threats, and even violence.
Amit Jethwa, an RTI activist from Gujarat, was murdered in 2010 after exposing illegal mining near the Gir Forest.
Does India have an alternative to the RTI?
Public Services Delivery Laws (Right to Public Services Act):
Various states in India have enacted
to ensure the timely delivery of public services and redress grievances.
Madhya Pradesh
was the first state to implement the
Right to Public Services Act (2010)
, which mandates timely delivery of services like issuing ration cards and driving licenses.
Whistleblower Protection Act (2014):
This law protects individuals who expose corruption and wrongdoing in government institutions. It allows whistleblowers to report issues while keeping their identity confidential.
An employee of a public sector bank can report irregularities without fear of retaliation under this Act. However, delays in operationalizing the law limit its effectiveness.
Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act (2013):
This law establishes an independent body (
) at the central level and
at the state level to investigate corruption among public officials.
In 2019, the
was appointed to investigate allegations of corruption against high-level public servants, including the Prime Minister (with conditions).
Way forward:
Strengthen Institutional Framework:
Ensure
timely appointment
of Information Commissioners, enforce
penalties
for delayed/incomplete responses, and streamline processes to reduce case backlogs.
Enhance Legal Safeguards:
Amend the
for better security of RTI activists and clarify exemptions under
to prevent misuse while balancing public interest.
Mains PYQ:
“Recent amendment to the Right to Information Act will have a profound impact on the autonomy and independence of the Information Commission”. Discuss.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
'Quality of Public Expenditure' Index
Why in the News?
The Quality of Public Expenditure (QPE) Index, developed by the RBI, evaluates how efficiently government funds are used, focusing on expenditure composition and its long-term impact on economic growth.
About the QPE Index
The QPE Index by the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
measures
how effectively government funds are utilized
It focuses on
fiscal discipline, capital investment, and efficient allocation of public resources
for long-term growth.
Key Indicators
of the QPE Index:
Capital Outlay to GDP Ratio
: Measures government spending on
infrastructure
as a percentage of GDP.
Higher ratio = better quality expenditure
Revenue Expenditure to Capital Outlay Ratio
: Lower ratio preferred, as excessive spending on salaries & subsidies reduces funds for development.
Development Expenditure to GDP Ratio
: Tracks spending in
education, healthcare, infrastructure
, improving human capital & productivity.
Development Expenditure as % of Total Expenditure:
Higher share indicates better resource allocation.
Interest Payments to Total Expenditure Ratio:
Lower ratio = better debt management & fiscal sustainability.
Key Findings from RBI’s QPE Index Analysis:
1991-2003
Post-liberalization,
focus on reducing fiscal deficit led to a decline in public investment
2003-2008
:  FRBM Act (2003)

**********Rupee-Dollar Swap Auction
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will conduct
a $10 billion dollar-rupee swap auction
on February 28, 2025, aimed at injecting durable rupee liquidity into the banking system.
This
3-year
forex swap is expected to
inject ₹86,000 crore
into the banking system at a time when there is a
liquidity deficit of ₹1.7 lakh crore
in the financial sector.
What is the RBI’s Forex Swap Auction?
Forex swap auctions are a
tool used by the RBI
to manage liquidity and stabilize financial markets.
In return, the RBI
will inject rupee liquidity
Buy-Sell Swap:
buys dollars now
sells them back later
(liquidity injection).
Sell-Buy Swap:
sells dollars now
buys them back later
(liquidity absorption).
After
3 years
, the transaction will be reversed, with the
RBI selling dollars back to banks
absorbing rupee liquidity
from the system.
How does it work?
Auction Process:
Banks
bid in the swap auction
by quoting the swap rate (forward premium).
lowest premium bids are accepted first
(similar to G-sec auctions).
Liquidity Injection:
sell US dollars to the RBI
at the prevailing exchange rate.
RBI provides rupees in exchange
, boosting liquidity in the banking system.
Reverse Swap After Three Years:
On
March 6, 2028
swap will be reversed
RBI will return US dollars to the banks
absorb the equivalent amount of rupees
This allows the
RBI to control liquidity over a longer period
without permanently altering its forex reserves.
