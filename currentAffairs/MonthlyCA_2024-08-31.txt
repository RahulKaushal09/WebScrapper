Influence of Wind Shear on Hurricanes
Source: DTE
Why in News?
Recently, the concept of
wind shear
has gained increased attention due to its crucial role in determining whether a storm intensifies into a destructive
hurricane
.
What is Wind Shear?
About:
Wind shear is a meteorological phenomenon that refers to a
sudden change in wind speed and/or wind direction
over a relatively small distance.
Types:
It is mainly of 2 types:
Vertical Wind Shear:
Occurs when wind speed and/or direction changes rapidly with increasing altitude.
Common examples include
low-level jet streams
and wind shear associated with
thunderstorms.
Horizontal Wind Shear:
Occurs when wind speed and/or direction changes rapidly over a
horizontal distance.
In this case, the wind might be blowing from the west at one spot, but then suddenly switch to blowing from the north just a bit further on.
frontal systems and sea breezes.
Major Causes:
Temperature Inversion:
During calm nights, warm air near the ground traps cooler air above, creating strong vertical wind shear, which could be a hazard for
aircraft taking off and landing.
Thunderstorms:
Powerful
updrafts and downdrafts
within thunderstorms cause both horizontal and vertical wind shear, making flying near them dangerous.
Frontal Systems:
Boundaries between
warm and cold air masses (fronts)
create rapid changes in wind speed and direction, resulting in horizontal wind shear that can challenge aircraft navigation.
Detection Methods:
Low-Level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS)
: This network of ground-based towers uses anemometers (wind speed sensors) and wind direction sensors to measure wind speed and direction at multiple points around an airport.
Doppler Radar:
On the ground, these radars track wind speed and direction to spot wind shear zones.
LIDAR:
This uses light to detect wind shear, especially helpful for clear air turbulence.

What are the Effects of Wind Shear on Hurricanes?
About Hurricanes: Hurricanes or
Tropical Cyclones
violent storms
that originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over to the coastal areas bringing about large scale destruction caused by violent winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surges.
Its formation and initial development depends upon the transfer of water vapor and heat from the warm ocean to the overlying air, primarily by evaporation from the sea surface.
They are given many names in different regions of the world such as:
Typhoons
in the China Sea and Pacific Ocean
Tornados
in the Guinea lands of West Africa and Southern USA
Willy-willies
in north-western Australia and
in the Indian Ocean
in the West Indian islands in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.

Effects of Wind Shear on Hurricanes:
Hurricanes thrive in environments with minimal vertical wind shear, as it allows for a
symmetrical structure
efficient rotation.
Strong vertical wind shear
can disrupt the hurricane's vertical structure,
offsetting the top of the storm
from the bottom.
weakens the wind circulation
, heat transport, and moisture supply, which are essential for fueling the hurricane.
Excessive vertical wind shear can potentially tear a hurricane apart.
Other Factors Affecting Hurricane Intensity:
While vertical wind shear is a significant factor, it is not the only determinant of hurricane intensity.
Other factors, such as
sea surface temperatures, atmospheric moisture
content,
pressure systems,
also play crucial roles in hurricane development and strengthening.
In some cases, exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures can overcome the effects of increased wind shear, as witnessed during the
2023 hurricane season.
What is the Influence of EL Nino and La Lina on Wind Shear?
El Nino's Influence on Wind Shear:
years, stronger-than-usual vertical wind shear is typically observed over the Atlantic Ocean during hurricane season.
El Nino events are characterised by warmer sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean and cooler temperatures in the western Pacific.
This pattern leads to stronger upper-level winds over the Atlantic, resulting in increased vertical wind shear.
The increased wind shear during El Nino years can make it more challenging for hurricanes to develop and intensify in the Atlantic basin.
La Nina's Influence on Wind Shear:
conditions, which are the opposite of El Nino, tend to be more favorable for hurricane development in the Atlantic.
During La Nina years, vertical wind shear is generally weaker over the Atlantic, allowing for more active hurricane seasons.
The record-breaking
2020 Atlantic hurricane season
occurred during a La Nina event.

Global Impact of Land Squeeze
Source: DTE
Why in News?
A recent study conducted by the
International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food)
focusses on the unprecedented ‘land squeeze’, threatening farmers and food production.
Land squeeze refers to the situation where the
demand for land for various purposes
(agriculture, urbanisation, infrastructure, etc.) outpaces the available cultivable land.
What are the Key Highlights of the Report?
The report
warns of prevalent "land squeeze"
due to rising land prices, land grabs, and carbon schemes, threatening farmers and food production.
Globally, the
top 1% of the world’s largest farms
now
control 70%
world’s farmland.
As land becomes scarce, it can be
converted from productive agricultural land
to other uses, impacting food production
Between
2008-2022
, there has been a
doubling of
global land prices.
This increase has been particularly pronounced in Central-Eastern Europe, where prices have tripled.
"Green grabs,
" land acquisitions are evidently motivated by
environmental concerns,
now account for approximately
20% of large-scale
land deals.
Green grabbing
refers to the large-scale acquisition or control of land and resources for environmental purposes, often with negative social and economic consequences. It's essentially land grabs done under the guise of environmental protection.
Over half of the land designated by governments for
carbon removal projects
presents a potential risk of interference with the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and Indigenous people.
Carbon offset markets
are expected to
quadruple
in the
next 7 years
What are the Key Reasons Behind Land Squeeze?
Land Grabs:
Large-scale acquisitions
of land by governments, corporations, and speculators are displacing farmers and Indigenous communities.
These acquisitions are mainly for
resource extraction
(mining, logging) or
export-oriented agriculture.
Rising Population and Demands:
increasing global population
along with the
huge demand for food, feed, fiber and fuel
is putting lots of pressure on the availability of the land.
Shifts in Global Food Production Systems
It involves the transfer of large areas of land towards
industrial agriculture
like
Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO)
monoculture farming practices.
Industrial agriculture
is the
large-scale, intensive production of crops and animals,
often involving chemical fertilizers on crops and harmful use of antibiotics in animals.
Also, there has been
increased demand for land for
biofuels
and other
non-food uses.
What are the Key Impacts of Land Squeeze?
Loss of Access and Control for Farmers and Rural Communities:
Displacement and Dispossession:
Land grabs and other pressures force small-scale farmers and indigenous communities off their land, disrupting their livelihoods and traditional ways of life.
Threatens Food Security:
With
fewer farmers and less land available
for food production, overall food security becomes threatened, particularly for local communities.
Weakened Bargaining Power:
land ownership
puts farmers at a
disadvantage in negotiating fair prices
for their products from powerful agribusinesses.
Exacerbated Rural Poverty:
Limited access to land restricts opportunities for
rural populations
, trapping them in a cycle of poverty.
Environmental Degradation:
Unsustainable Practices
: The focus on
large-scale, export-oriented agriculture
often leads to unsustainable land use practices, such as
deforestation
, soil depletion, and overuse of water resources.
Loss of Biodiversity:
Land conversion for mining, infrastructure, and industrial agriculture
destroys natural habitats
and threatens biodiversity.
Increased Vulnerability to Climate Change:
Degradation of soil health and loss of natural vegetation
weaken ecosystems,
making them more vulnerable to
climate shocks.
Social Unrest and Conflict:
Competition for Resources
: Competition for scarce land resources can lead to
social tensions and conflicts
between communities and investors.
According to the report by
IPES-Food, over half of the land
presents a potential risk of interference with the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and indigenous people.
Instability and Outmigration:
Loss of land and livelihood opportunities triggers
rural-urban migration
, putting pressure on urban resources and social services.
What are the Recommendations of the Report?
Halt Land Grabs
: Policies and regulations are
needed to prevent land grabs
and ensure land use decisions prioritise local communities and food security.
Support Small-Scale Farmers
: Investments in rural infrastructure, secure land tenure, and access to financing are crucial for empowering small-scale producers.
Sustainable Land Management:
Promote practices that protect soil health, conserve biodiversity, and ensure long-term food production.
Fair Trade Policies:
Trade agreements should be reformed to promote sustainable agriculture and protect the livelihoods of small-scale farmers.
Conclusion
The land squeeze is a complex issue demanding a multifaceted solution. By addressing the underlying causes and supporting small-scale food producers, we can ensure equitable access to land, protect our environment, and build a more sustainable food system for the future.

Low Snow Persistence in Hindu Kush Himalayas
Source: TH
Why in News?
The recent report from the
International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD)
has shown that the snow persistence in the
Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Indus basins
of the
Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH)
has reached record low levels.
is a regional intergovernmental organisation established
in 1983
and working
towards a greener, more inclusive, and climate-resilient
Hindu Kush Himalaya.
What are the Findings of the Report?
Global Findings:
Amu Darya river basin
in Afghanistan reported its lowest snow persistence, the
Helmand River,
crucial for Iran and Afghanistan's drinking water supply, saw its snow persistence nearly 32% below normal.
China’s
Yellow River
exceeding normal levels by
20.2%
, is influenced by the interaction of
cold air from the east asian winter monsoon
with moist air from the
Pacific Ocean.
India’s Context:
The report analysed data from 2003 to 2024, revealing that the Ganga River basin experienced its
lowest snow persistence in 22 years,
and the Brahmaputra basin recorded a
14.6% decrease
in snow persistence compared to normal levels.
Reason Behind Low Snow Persistence:
Impact of Weakened Western Disturbances and Global Warming:
This study reveals that weakened
western disturbances
from warmer seas in the Mediterranean,
Caspian,
Black Seas
have reduced
winter precipitation and snowfall
in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region.
Additionally, global warming has intensified
La Niña and El Niño events
further decreasing the region's snow persistence capacity.
1.5°C global temperature limit
set under the
Paris Agreement
may not be sufficient for the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, as this area is expected to experience higher temperature increases than the global average.
Environmental Degradation:
Environmental degradation in the HKH region, driven by
deforestation, overgrazing, unsustainable land practices
, and infrastructure development, is leading to profound impacts such as
soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and water pollution
in the region.
The Proliferation of Invasive Species:
The proliferation of invasive species such as Cirsium arvense
(Canada thistle)
and Trifolium repens
(white clover)
poses a significant threat to native Himalayan species, upsetting the delicate balance of the region's ecosystem.
Key Recommendations:
Long-term Strategies:
This study suggests that
reforestation
with native species such as
improves
snow retention
in the HKH region.
Enhanced
weather forecasting
early warning systems
Improved
water infrastructure
and enact protective policies for snow-receiving areas.
Community involvement i
n decision-making along with promoting regional cooperation will help restore the HKH region.
Climate Change Mitigation:
Reduce emissions to mitigate rising temperatures and focus on
G-20 countries
as they are responsible for 81% of global emissions
Shift away from
fossil fuels
cleaner energy sources.
What is the Hindu Kush Himalaya Region?
Geographical Spans of HKH:
The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region spans
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.

India's Water Stress and Hydropower
Source: LM
Why in News?
Recently,
Moody's Ratings
has warned that
India's escalating water shortage, climate change-driven natural disasters
can disrupt several sectors including agricultural production and industrial operations which could undermine the country's
sovereign credit strength
.
What is the Current State of Hydropower Generation in India?
Current State of Hydropower Generation:
Hydropower generation in India has
declined by 17.33%
from 162.05 billion units in FY23 to
133.97 billion units in FY24.
India's installed large
hydro capacity currently stands at 46.92 GW,
constituting approximately
10% of the nation's total power generation capability of 442.85 GW.
Capacity addition
of large hydropower projects witnessed a
decline in FY24,
with only
60 MW added
compared to 120 MW in FY23.
Factors Responsible of Low Hydropower Genera
Delayed and Irregular
monsoons
: The southwest monsoon has been
delayed
this year
and the patchy rainfall due to
El-nino Effect
and a prolonged dry spell last year have left water reservoirs drying up.
Low Reservoir Levels:
India's 150 key reservoirs had a
live storage of only 37.662 BCM, representing 21%
of their live storage capacity and 80% less than the previous year.
Indira Sagar reservoir
in Madhya Pradesh, which supports a hydel capacity of 1 GW, is currently
17% full
, down from 24% at this time last year (2023).
Meanwhile, the
Koyana dam
in Maharashtra, with a hydro power capacity of 1.9 GW, is at
10% capacity
, lower than the usual level of 15% for this time of year.
Shutdown of Hydropower Plants
: Some hydropower plants were shut down in the last few years
due to the adverse impact of
floods
cloudbursts,
and these plants are yet to resume operations.
Implications of Low Hydropower for Energy Sector:
Increased Reliance on
Thermal Power
: With declining hydropower generation compared to last year,
coal-fired power plants will have the load
to meet the rising power demand.
Disruptions in Power Supply:
Industries with high water usage, such as coal power plants and steel makers, will be impacted by the shortage of water supply.
Further delay in monsoons has led to several
thermal power plants not undergoing the required maintenance
, which may lead to
faults and trippings
in power supply.
Reduced Hydropower Potential
: The decline in water availability will further limit the
potential for hydropower generation,
which is a crucial component of India's
renewable energy
component.
What is the Current State of Water in India?
Water scarcity
: India has a large
population (18%
of the world's total) but limited
freshwater resources (only 4%
of the world's total). This makes it a water-stressed country.
Water pollution:
Around
50%
of India's rivers are contaminated and polluted, making the water unsafe for drinking or irrigation.
Overdependence on groundwater
: India is the
world's largest user of groundwater
, which is leading to depletion of these resources.
Groundwater
plays a vital role in ensuring water security in rural and urban areas, fulfilling around
80% of the drinking water requirements
two-thirds of agricultural irrigation needs
in the country.
Climate Vulnerability:
three-quarters of India's districts
are vulnerable to
extreme weather
events like droughts and floods, which can further disrupt water availability.
What are the Causes of Water Stress in India ?
Rapid Economic Growth and Urbanisation
: India's population has grown rapidly, from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.3 billion in 2024.
This has led to a significant
increase in water demand for both domestic and industrial uses
, putting a strain on already stressed resources. Industries, major water consumers, further exacerbate the problem by polluting water bodies with their effluents.
Declining Water Availability
: According to the Ministry of Jal Shakti, India's average annual water availability per capita is likely to drop to
1,367 cubic metres by 2031
from an already-low
1,486 cubic metres in 2021.
A level below 1,700 cubic metres indicates
water stress,
with 1,000 cubic metres being the threshold for
water scarcity.
Climate Change and Weakening Monsoon Patterns:
The Indian Ocean has been warming at a rate of
1.2 degrees Celsius per century during 1950-2020,
and this is expected to intensify to
1.7-3.8 degrees Celsius during 2020-2100.
This warming is leading to a
narrowing gap between land and sea temperatures, weakening the monsoon circulation
and resulting in
more severe and frequent droughts.
Changing weather patterns and melting glaciers
in the Himalayas are altering the availability and distribution of water resources.
Agricultural Practices and Inefficient Usage:
Agriculture accounts for over
of India's total water usage.
Inefficient irrigation techniques, such as
flood irrigation,
cultivation of
water-intensive crops
like rice and sugarcane in water-scarce regions further strains water resources.
Groundwater Depletion:
Central Ground Water Board, 54%
of India's groundwater resources are
overexploited
excessive and unregulated groundwater extraction
for irrigation and other purposes.
Poor Water Infrastructure and Management
: India's water management system suffers from
deficiencies in infrastructure and governance. Inadequate storage, distribution, and treatment facilities
lead to significant water losses and inefficiencies.
Additionally,
weak water management policies, monitoring, and enforcement
worsen these issues.
Water Pollution:
Industrial effluents,
agricultural runoff, and domestic sewage
have polluted many of India's surface and groundwater resources. This has reduced the availability of clean, usable water for various purposes.
What are the Implications of Water Scarcity in India?
Health Impacts:
Lack of access to safe drinking water can lead to various health issues like dehydration, infections, and waterborne diseases. The
NITI Aayog
reports that
around 200,000 people die in India annually due to inadequate water supply
and related issues.
Ecological Damage
: Water scarcity poses a
threat to wildlife and natural habitats, as animals are forced to venture into human settlements,
leading to conflicts and endangerment.
It has also disrupted the biodiversity and ecological balance of ecosystems.
Reduced Agricultural Productivity:
Agricultural sector,
which consumes 85% of India's water resources,
has been negatively affected with water scarcity leading to reduced crop yields,
affecting food security, and increasing poverty among farmers.
Economic Losses:
Water scarcity can hamper India's economic growth and development by
affecting industrial production, reducing energy generation
, and increasing the cost of water supply and treatment.
World Bank's
Climate Change, Water and Economy' report
(2016) warns that countries with water shortages may face a significant setback in economic growth by 2050.
Effect on India’s Climate Goal:
India targets generating
50% of its electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030
and lower hydropower output would lead to
relying heavily on solar and wind power
to fulfil its climate pledge.
Way Forward
Sustainable Groundwater Management:
There is a need to devise a proper mechanism and rural-urban integrated projects for
artificial recharge to groundwater
rainwater harvesting
at household level, conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater, and regulation of water reservoirs.
Smart Agriculture:
Drip irrigation
is a powerful technology that can reduce water consumption by
20-40%
increasing crop yield by 20-50%
compared to furrow
(flood) irrigation.
Also, cultivation of
s like pulses, millets and oilseeds
should be encouraged
in water-stressed regions.
Blue-Green Infrastructure:
Combining
green and blue
elements together in modern infrastructure planning can be an effective way of providing a sustainable natural solution for
watershed management
and eco friendly infrastructure.
Green indicates
: Gardens, permeable pavements, green roofs.
Blue indicates
: Water bodies like rivers, canals, ponds and
wetlands.
Using Modern Water Management Techniques:
Information Technology
can be integrated with water-related data systems to enhance management and efficiency.
Recent advances in technology have enabled the purification of water previously deemed unfit for consumption, making it clean and safe.
Some of the most commonly used techniques include
Electrodialysis Reversal (EDR)
Desalination
Nanofiltration
Solar and UV Filtration.

Summer Solstice 2024
Source: IE
Why in News?
Recently,
21
Jun
e has been marked as the day of the summer solstice in the
northern
hemisphere
of the world.
The
is celebrated as the beginning of summer, or midsummer when one of Earth’s poles is at its maximum tilt towards the sun.
What is the Summer Solstice?
Origin:
Origin of Summer Solstice can be traced to around
200 BC when ancient Greek scholar Eratosthenes,
conducted a experiment to measure the Earth’s circumference.
He observed that
on the summer solstice, sunlight shone directly down a well in Aswan, Egypt,
indicating the sun was directly overhead.
By calculating the difference in shadow lengths between Awan and Alexandria cities and the distance between them, Eratosthenes was able to
provide an early and accurate estimate of the Earth’s circumference.
About:
marks the longest day of the year, when the
sun reaches its highest point in the sky.
During the solstice, the Earth’s axis (around which the planet spins, completing one turn each day) is tilted in a way that the
North Pole is tipped towards the sun
and the South Pole is away from it.
Typically,
this imaginary axis p
asses right through the middle of the Earth from top to bottom and is
always tilted at 23.5 degrees with respect to the sun.
At the
Arctic Circle
66°33′ north latitude)
, the sun never sets during the solstice.
The amount of light received by a specific area in the
Northern Hemisphere
during the summer solstice depends on the latitudinal location of the place.
Effect:
During this, countries in the
are nearest to the Sun and the Sun shines overhead on the
Tropic of Cancer (23.5° North).
The Earth rotates on its axis, causing the Northern Hemisphere
to receive more direct sunlight between March and September.
incoming energy the Earth receives
from the sun on this day is
30% higher at the North Pole than at the Equator.

<img alt="What is Cold Lava? Blog Image" class="cover-image-size" src="https://vajiram-prod.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Cold_Lava_64593e8d83.webp"/>
Overview:
Mt. Kanlaon Natural Park on Negros Island, Philippines, witnessed rivers of cold lava following an explosive eruption recently.
About Cold Lava:
Called “lahar”
in Indonesian, cold lava is a phenomenon that occurs
when rain mixes with volcanic materials
like ash, sand, and pebbles.
The mixture forms a
concrete-like substance
that destroys everything in its path.
Rain can carry cold lava down the slopes
of a volcano during an eruption and into the paths of nearby towns or villages.
Unlike traditional lava flows
which move slowly
and give residents time to evacuate,
cold lava can advance rapidly
, at a speed of hundreds of kilometres per hour, and spread as far away as 60 km from the volcano.
One of the defining characteristics of cold lava is its ability to
pick up additional debris and sediment as it travels
downhill.
This mixture can
rapidly increase in volume and destructive potential
, transforming from a relatively innocuous flow into a powerful force.
It is considered
more destructive and deadlier compared to regular lava flows
Its
high density and abrasive nature
mean that it can cause significant damage to buildings, bridges, and roads, posing a serious threat to human life and property.
Cold lava
remains hot internally
due to chemical reactions within the volcanic material, but
its external appearance and behaviour
more akin to wet concrete.
While it is
commonly associated with volcanic eruptions
, lahars can
also occur when no eruption takes place.
Sometimes, heavy rainfall or snowfall can easily erode and transport fine-grained, loose volcanic sediment and form a slurry, especially if vegetation has not had time to grow back on recent volcanic deposits.
Q1: What is Lava?
Lava is hot, liquefied rock that flows from a volcano or other opening in the surface of Earth. When the liquid rock is still underground it is known as magma. Igneous rock is formed when lava cools and hardens.
