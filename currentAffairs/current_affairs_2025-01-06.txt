Building a System That Sees the Migrant Worker
Context
The
Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoL&E) in India recently declared the e-Shram portal as the largest database of unorganised workers
globally, with over 300 million workers registered.
Launched in May 2021
in response to the Supreme Court's directive,
the portal aimed to address the distressing plight of migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic
by creating a unified national database.
Despite this ambitious initiative, challenges in its implementation and gaps in its utility highlight the pressing need for more robust measures
to ensure social protection and inclusion for India's vulnerable unorganised workforce.
Historical Context and the Need for a Database
The concept of maintaining a database for migrant and unorganised workers is not new.
The Interstate Migrant Workmen Act (1979) mandated contractors to provide detailed worker records,
and the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (2007) called for universal worker registration.
Similarly,
the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act (2008) proposed identity cards for workers.
However,
these efforts failed to gain traction
, leaving millions of workers invisible to policymakers and the public.
This historical neglect underscores the significance of the e-Shram porta
l as a potentially transformative initiative.
Understanding the Vulnerability of Migrant Workers
Socio-Economic Exclusion
The lack of stable employment ties leaves migrant workers in a precarious situation.
Many are employed informally
in sectors such as construction, agriculture, domestic work, and small-scale industries, where job security is almost non-existent.
Without formal contracts, they have little to no bargaining power
and are frequently subjected to exploitative working conditions, including low wages, long hours, and unsafe environments.
absence of unionisation further worsens their vulnerability,
as they are unable to collectively advocate for better terms or working conditions.
Challenges of Disenfranchisement
Due to the transient nature of their employment,
migrant workers often lack access to fundamental rights like voting.
Many are unable to register as voters in their place of work
, and their names are often missing from electoral rolls in their home states.
disenfranchisement not only alienates them politically but also deprives them of a voice in decisions
that directly impact their lives, reinforcing their marginalisation.
Poor Access to Social Services
Access to essential services
such as healthcare, education, housing, and social security
is severely limited for migrant workers.
lack of portability of welfare benefits across states means that they often cannot avail themselves of government schemes
in their place of work.
For instance,
migrant families may lose access to ration cards
or healthcare benefits when they move to a new location.
their children are at risk of losing continuity in education due to frequent relocations,
perpetuating the cycle of poverty and vulnerability.
Stigma and Discrimination
Migrant workers frequently face stigma and discrimination
in host communities.
They are
often viewed as outsiders and treated with suspicion
, which leads to social exclusion and sometimes even hostility.
This discrimination can limit their opportunities
to integrate into local communities and access resources, further isolating them.
Women migrants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and harassment
, both at work and in their living conditions, compounding their struggles.
Persistent Challenges
Documentation and Eligibility Exclusion
A significant challenge
lies in the exclusion of workers due to inadequate documentation.
Many migrant workers lack essential identification documents
such as Aadhaar cards, ration cards, or voter IDs, which are often prerequisites for registration.
Additionally,
issues such as unlinked mobile numbers, lack of permanent phone access, or inconsistent address details complicates their ineligibility.
For workers who are constantly on the move or live in temporary housing,
these documentation requirements become insurmountable hurdles,
effectively locking them out of social protection mechanisms
Technological Barriers
Although the e-Shram portal aims to simplify access through technology,
digital illiteracy among unorganised workers poses a significant barrier.
Many workers, especially those in rural areas, are unfamiliar with online processes
or lack access to smartphones and reliable internet connectivity.
digital divide disproportionately affects women workers
, who often have limited access to personal mobile devices.
As a result, many workers are unable to navigate the registration process independently,
relying on intermediaries who may exploit them.
Limited Portability of Benefits
mobility of migrant workers creates a unique challenge in ensuring access to welfare benefits
across states.
While initiatives like the
One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC)
attempt to address this issue,
many schemes remain tied to a worker’s place of origin.
lack of portability leaves inter-state migrants unable to access entitlements
such as subsidised food, housing, or healthcare in their destination states.
Without seamless integration of welfare schemes across jurisdictions, a large segment of the migrant workforce remains excluded
from critical support systems.
Fragmentation of Social Security Systems
India’s social security landscape is highly fragmented
, with multiple schemes operating under different ministries and departments.
While the
OSS attempts to integrate these schemes, the process is far from complete.
Key welfare programs like PM Matru Vandana Yojana and Shramik Suraksha Yojana are yet to be linked with the e-Shram portal
, leaving gaps in coverage.
overlapping responsibilities and bureaucratic inefficiencies slow down the implementation of a cohesive framework.
The Path Ahead
To fully realise its potential,
the e-Shram portal must transcend its role as a mere registration platform and evolve into a comprehensive tool
for empowering workers.
requires disaggregating migration data, enhancing portability of benefits, and integrating human development outcomes
into program design.
Non-profits and policymakers advocate viewing migrants as assets rather than burden
s, emphasising their critical role in driving economic growth.
The 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development warns
that poorly managed migration can impede progress.
Conclusion
Migrants and unorganised workers are indispensable to India's economy,
yet they continue to await recognition and rights.
The e-Shram portal and OSS are commendable steps, but achieving "Viksit Bharat" (Developed India) demands well-designed social protection systems
that prioritise inclusion and equity for this workforce.
While the e-Shram portal has laid the foundation for addressing long-standing challenges faced by unorganised workers,
its success depends on overcoming systemic barriers and integrating inclusive, sustainable policies.

Editorial Analysis
**********What is a Chargesheet?
The Supreme Court recently held that offences in the chargesheet cannot be based on bald assertions of connivance.
About Chargesheet:
A chargesheet is a
final report
that is
filed by the investigating officer
or police officials
after the completion of the investigation
in a cognizable or non-cognizable case.
It is also known as
the Police report or the Final report
contains all the stringent records
right
from the commencement of the investigation
procedure of lodging an FIR
to the completion of the investigation
and the preparation of final report.
The chargesheet has to be prepared and
submitted by the police before the court
proceedings can begin.
Once the charge sheet has been submitted to a court of law,
prosecution proceedings
against the accused begin.
This report by the investigating officer should be in the
form prescribed by the state government.
Contents of the chargesheet:
Names of the parties
Nature of the information
Names of the persons who appear to be acquainted with the events
About the offence that appears to have been committed and the person by whom it has been committed
Information regarding the arrest of the accused, his/their release with or without sureties, and whether he has been forwarded into custody
Benefits of a chargesheet:
It contains the statements of the accused and all other witnesses.
It marks the beginning of a criminal trial.
Charges on which courts have to proceed against the accused are mentioned.
It is useful for the accused in obtaining bail as the offences are mentioned clearly.
Time limit for filing a Charge Sheet:
It is to be filed within 60 days from the date of arrest of the accused in cases triable by lower courts and 90 days in cases triable by the Court of Sessions.
If the charge sheet is not filed within the prescribed time mentioned above, the accused has a right to default bail.
Is filing a chargesheet compulsory?
Filing of a chargesheet
in case a cognizable offence
is said to be committed by the accused
is mandatory
on the part of police officials, either by themselves or on the orders of the court, after filing an FIR.
However, the same is
not compulsory in cases where a non-cognizable offence
has been committed unless the court orders an investigation.
Cognizable and Non-Cognizable Offence:
or case is defined as one which an officer in-charge of a police station
may investigate without
the order of a magistrate and effect arrest
without a warrant.
The Police have a
direct responsibility to take immediate action
on the receipt of a complaint or credible information in such crimes, visit the scene of the crime, investigate the facts, apprehend the offender, and arraign him before a Court of law having jurisdiction over the matter.
Non-Cognizable crimes
are defined as those which
cannot be investigated by police without the order of a competent magistrate.

bone fractures).
Most people don’t know they have osteoporosis until it causes them to break a bone.
Osteoporosis can make any of the bones more likely to break, but the
most commonly affected bones
include of:
Hips (hip fractures)
Wrists
Spine (fractured vertebrae)
Osteoporosis occurs when the
creation of new bone doesn't keep up with the loss of old bone.
Low level of hormones, like
estrogen in women and testosterone in men
can cause osteoporosis.
Symptoms

lots of
other health conditions
That’s why healthcare providers
sometimes call it a silent disease.
The most
common “symptom” is suddenly breaking a bone
, especially after a small fall or minor accident.
Once the bones have been weakened by osteoporosis, the common
signs and symptoms
include:
Back pain
, caused by a broken or collapsed bone in the spine.
Loss of height over time.
A stooped posture.
Treatment
: Treatment for osteoporosis may involve:

**********Atomic clock
A "groundbreaking" atomic clock built at a top-secret UK lab will make military operations more secure through experimental quantum technology over the years.
About
Atomic clock:
It is a device that measures time
using the vibrations of atoms.
It specifically uses the
oscillations of the electrons in atoms
to keep time.
It is the most accurate time-keeping device available, with a margin of error of just a few billionths of a second per day.
It is far more precise than conventional clocks because atomic oscillations have a much higher frequency and are
much more stable.
Working:
Atomic clocks work by using a type of atom called
a "cesium atom".
Cesium atoms are very stable and
have a very specific frequency
at which their electrons vibrate. This frequency is used as the basis for the atomic clock's timekeeping.
To measure time using cesium atoms, an atomic clock uses a device called a
"microwave cavity".
The microwave cavity is a chamber that is filled with cesium vapor.
A microwave signal is then sent into the cavity, which causes the cesium atoms to vibrate. As the cesium atoms vibrate, they emit radiation at a very specific frequency.
This frequency is then detected by a detector, which compares it to a standard frequency.
The difference between the two frequencies is used to adjust the clock's timekeeping.
Applications:
GPS systems:
GPS systems use atomic clocks to measure the time it takes for a signal to travel from a satellite to a receiver on Earth. This allows GPS systems to calculate the receiver's location with great accuracy.
Telecommunications networks:
Telecommunications networks use atomic clocks to synchronize the timing of signals that are sent over long distances.
Scientific research:
Atomic clocks are used in many scientific experiments that require precise timing, such as studies of the behavior of atoms and molecules.

**********What is KM3NeT Project?
Scientists are deploying two telescopes which are part of the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope or KM3NeT to detect high-energy neutrinos, also known as ghost particles, under the Mediterranean Sea.
About
KM3NeT Project:
It is a research infrastructure housing the next generation
neutrino telescopes
with a volume of at least one cubic kilometre.
It uses
Cherenkov radiation
(light that neutrinos produce when they interact with a water or ice molecule) to study neutrinos.
As a European research infrastructure, it is located in the
and involves collaboration among multiple countries.
Key components:
ARCA (Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss):
It will help scientists in searching neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources such as
supernovae, gamma ray bursters or colliding stars.
It is located offshore Sicily, Italy.
ORCA
(Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss):
This telescope is the instrument for KM3NeT scientists studying neutrino properties exploiting neutrinos
generated in the Earth's atmosphere.
It is located offshore of France.
These telescopes are much like the
IceCube Neutrino Observatory
, which can detect high-energy neutrinos from deep space but is under the frozen ice in the Antarctic rather than being in the water.
Arrays of thousands of optical sensors will detect the faint light in the deep sea from charged particles originating from
collisions of the neutrinos and the Earth.
IceCube Neutrino Observatory?
It is a device located at the
Earth’s South Pole
that detects subatomic particles called neutrinos. Built and maintained by the IceCube Collaboration, it consists of approximately 350 physicists from 58 institutions across 14 countries, led by the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
IceCube collaborators address several big questions in physics, like the

**********Badge engineering - Different cars, same look
Why in news?
Nearly half of Toyota Kirloskar Motor's car sales in India over the past year were rebadged Maruti Suzuki models, driving Toyota to its highest-ever wholesale numbers and over 40% year-on-year sales growth in FY24.
The success of "badge engineering" as a sales strategy highlights its growing popularity among carmakers, with expectations of continued use in the coming year.
What’s in today’s article?
What is Badge Engineering?
Badge Engineering – early origin and uses
Benefits of Badge Engineering
Collaboration at the Platform Level
About
Badge engineering involves the sharing of a vehicle platform or an entire model between different car manufacturers.
This allows at least one of them to avoid designing or engineering a new model from scratch.
Key Features
Shared Elements:
Cars can share platforms, design cues, engines, or parts.
Aesthetic Tweaks:
Some design elements are modified to align with individual brand identities.
Degrees of Rebadging
Minimal Changes:
Simple badge swaps with little alteration.
Extensive Customization:
Completely distinct cars built from the same platform.
Early Origins: GM's Pioneer Move (1909)
General Motors began sharing chassis and platforms among its brands, marking one of the earliest examples of badge engineering.
GMC trucks were rebadged as Chevrolet models, while platforms were shared with brands like Oakland, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac.
Premium brands like Buick and Cadillac received enhanced exteriors and interiors for a luxurious appeal.
India’s Early Badge-Engineering Success: Ambassador
The Hindustan Motors Ambassador (1957–2014) was one of India’s first successful badge-engineered vehicles.
It was essentially a rebadged Series III Morris Oxford.
A Global Attempt Gone Wrong: Rover CityRover
The Rover CityRover (2003–2005) was a rebadged Tata Indica marketed by MG Rover in the UK.
While the Indica succeeded in India, the CityRover failed in the UK, criticized as a poorly executed attempt to prevent MG Rover’s bankruptcy.
Cost Efficiency through Badge Engineering
The auto industry benefits from economies of scale by producing similar models, sharing costs, and spreading investments.
This approach keeps overheads low and increases production volumes.
Consumer Advantages and Buying Decisions
Buyers consider factors like brand familiarity, warranty offers, and dealership accessibility.
Badge engineering allows carmakers to position themselves as premium product builders, justifying higher price tags.
Expanding Customer Reach
Maruti Suzuki:
Targets premium segments with rebadged models like the Invicto (Toyota Innova Hycross).
Toyota Kirloskar:
Taps into the lower-end market with models like the Taisor and Glanza.
Retaining and Upselling Customers
Maruti Suzuki retains customers by offering upgrades as they move up the price bracket.
Toyota provides multiple options in segments where it has traditionally struggled, such as lower-end vehicles and CNG-equipped models.
Cross-brand partnerships sometimes occur during the early stages of car development, focusing on shared platforms.
Unlike badge engineering, these partnerships result in more differentiated products.
Examples in the Indian Market
Hyundai and Kia
Models like the Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos, or Hyundai Venue and Kia Sonet, share platforms, engines, and gearboxes.
Despite shared underpinnings, they differ significantly in design and features.
The two companies compete fiercely despite their collaborative roots.
Volkswagen and Skoda
Partnerships are evident in models like the VW Taigun and Skoda Kushaq, or VW Virtus and Skoda Slavia.
While they share basic platforms, differences exist in design, ground clearance, engines, and gearboxes.
Key Feature: Competitive Independence
Although these partnerships originate at the development stage, brands ensure individuality and compete independently in the market.
Success and Challenges of Badge Engineering
While Toyota and Maruti Suzuki's partnership has been highly successful, other collaborations have not fared as well.
Unsuccessful Partnerships
Renault and Nissan:
Nissan’s Terrano (a rebadged Renault Duster) and Renault Scala (a rebadged Nissan Sunny) both failed to gain traction.
Flagship Models Kept Exclusive
Some popular models, such as Suzuki's Swift and Jimny, and Toyota’s Innova Crysta and Fortuner, have been excluded from badge engineering partnerships.
Luxury Failures:
Aston Martin's Cygnet (a rebadged Toyota iQ with premium features) flopped due to poor sales despite its high price.
Volkswagen and Audi -
The Audi 50, essentially a rebadged VW Polo, was discontinued despite the Polo’s widespread success.
Lessons Learned
Badge engineering works best when consumer preferences and brand positioning are carefully aligned.
However, it can fail when the rebadged product is misaligned with the target market or priced unrealistically.

**********Arunachal Pradesh's Dormant Anti-Conversion Law Revived After 46 Years
Why in News?
The Arunachal Pradesh government is framing rules to implement
the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 1978
, which has been dormant for 46 years.
The move has reignited debates on religious freedom, indigenous culture, and state intervention in faith matters.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What’s in the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act?
Why was the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act Introduced?
Why has the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act Remained Dormant?
Why is the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act Back Now?
Conclusion
Enacted:
1978 by Arunachal’s first Legislative Assembly.
Purpose:
To prohibit religious conversion by force, inducement, or fraudulent means.
Penalties:
Imprisonment up to two years.
Fine up to ₹10,000 for forced conversions.
Reporting requirement:
All conversions must be reported to the Deputy Commissioner.
Non-compliance penalizes the individual performing the conversion.
The Act remained dormant due to the absence of implementation rules.
Diverse ethnic communities:
Arunachal has a rich tapestry of indigenous beliefs, including Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism, and polytheistic practices like Donyi Polo worship.
Missionary inroads:
Christianity entered Arunachal in the 1950s, later than other northeastern states, due to colonial isolation policies and difficult terrain.
First church was established in 1957 at Rayang village.
Debates on conversion:
Conversion led to socio-cultural changes in tribes like the Adi, Nocte, and Nyishi, sparking discussions on preserving indigenous cultures in the Assembly.
Opposition by Christian groups:
The Arunachal Christian Forum (formed in 1979) has consistently opposed the Act, calling it “anti-Christian” and prone to misuse.
Christianity now constitutes 30.26% of the population (2011 Census), the largest religious group in the state.
Political sensitivities:
Successive Chief Ministers avoided implementing the Act due to fears of alienating a significant voter base.
External influences:
The BJP government and RSS’s support for institutionalizing indigenous faiths renewed attention on the Act.
Legal push:
In 2022, advocate Tambo Tamin filed a PIL in the Guwahati High Court, seeking rules for the Act’s implementation.
The court directed the state to finalize draft rules within six months.
Preserving indigenous culture:
Experts emphasize the Act’s role in preventing the erosion of traditional practices amid rising conversions.
Conclusion:
The revival of the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 1978, underscores the ongoing tensions between protecting indigenous cultures and safeguarding religious freedom.
As implementation looms, debates are expected to intensify, reflecting the delicate balance between faith, politics, and identity in the state.

**********Zoos put on alert as avian flu kills 3 tigers
Why in news?
Three tigers and a leopard at a Nagpur rescue center have died from avian influenza (H5N1), a rare instance of the virus affecting rescued wildlife in India.
In response, the Union government has issued an advisory, urging zoos nationwide to remain vigilant, follow the action plan for prevention and containment, and monitor for symptoms in captive animals or nearby areas. The advisory highlights the highly contagious and zoonotic nature of the disease.
What’s in today’s article?
Avian influenza (H5N1)
Overview of Bird Flu
Bird flu, or avian flu, is an infectious viral illness primarily affecting poultry and wild birds.
Various strains of the virus have circulated among at least 100 bird species, with wild waterfowl like ducks and geese often serving as carriers without severe harm.
About
H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or "bird flu").
Basically, it is a
subtype of the influenza A virus
Influenza A viruses are classified by subtypes based on the properties of their surface proteins.
Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person.
When people become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%.
Evolution and Global Spread of H5N1
The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus originated from a goose farm outbreak in Guangdong, China, in 1996.
A new version of the virus emerged in Europe in 2020 and rapidly spread to Africa, Asia, North America (2021), South America (2022), and mainland Antarctica (2024), causing widespread illness and death among birds.
Impact on Farm and Wild Birds
Farm Birds
: H5N1 spreads quickly in overcrowded poultry farms, leading to significant outbreaks and fatalities.
: The virus has caused severe mortality among wild bird populations, including:
Great Skuas in Scotland (2021)
Barnacle Geese in Solway Firth (2021/22)
Thousands of ducks, swans, gulls, and birds of prey like Peregrine Falcons and Golden Eagles across Europe.
Endangered species like the
California condor
have been significantly affected, with 21 deaths reported in 2023, constituting nearly 6% of the population.
Spread Among Mammals
H5N1 has begun infecting mammals, raising concerns about viral reassortment and increased virulence:
Terrestrial Mammals: Cases reported among foxes, pumas, skunks, and bears in North America.
Farmed Mammals: Minks in Spain and Finland have been infected, increasing the risk of cross-species transmission.
Marine Mammals: Massive die-offs have been observed, including:
Over 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru.
Thousands of seals in the US.
95% mortality among Southern elephant seal pups along the Patagonia coastline (2023), marking the first major elephant seal mortality in half a century.
Human Risk
Although humans rarely contract bird flu, infections typically occur through contact with sick birds at poultry farms, where viral loads are high.
India's First Case of Avian Influenza in Animals
Maharashtra reported India's first case of avian influenza (H5N1) among animals.
Three tigers and one leopard have succumbed to the virus at a Nagpur rescue center in late December 2024.
This marks the first instance of bird flu crossing the species barrier in India.
Government Response and Guidelines
The Union Animal Husbandry Ministry issued a circular urging all States to quarantine infected or symptomatic tigers and other feline species to prevent transmission to humans and other animals.
The ministry plans to release detailed guidelines within a week.
Investigation and Containment Efforts
Post-mortem samples from the affected animals tested positive for avian influenza at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal.
Authorities suspect contaminated chicken meat could be the source of the infection.
A National Joint Outbreak Response Team has been deployed to implement containment measures, while human contacts are being screened as a precaution.
Enhanced Biosecurity Protocols
The Ministry directed:
Temporary closure of affected establishments to the public.
Strengthening biosecurity measures and restricting personnel movement between infected and healthy areas.
Thorough disinfection of affected areas and collection of samples for strain identification.

**********Why was the no-detention policy rolled back?
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues in the education system;
Why in the News?
Recently, the Union government revised the Rules of the Right to Education Act, 2009, permitting schools to retain students in Classes 5 and 8 if they fail to meet the promotion criteria based on a year-end examination.
What led to the amendment of the Right to Education Act, 2009 Rules?
Significant Learning Gaps:
Surveys, including the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), revealed alarming deficiencies in foundational skills among students. For example, a substantial percentage of Class 5 students were unable to read at their grade level, indicating a pressing need for intervention.
Declining Academic Performance:
National Achievement Surveys showed a downward trend in student performance as they progressed through grades, with average scores dropping significantly from Class 3 to Class 8. This decline raised concerns about the effectiveness of the no-detention policy.
Impact of COVID-19:
The disruptions caused by the pandemic exacerbated existing learning gaps, prompting educational authorities to reconsider policies that may have contributed to inadequate learning outcomes.
Ineffective Implementation of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE):
The original intent of the RTE Act included CCE to assess students continuously. However, its poor implementation led to many schools neglecting assessments altogether, resulting in automatic promotions without evaluating students’ actual learning.
What are the new rules?
Rollback of No-Detention Policy:
The amendment effectively rolls back the no-detention policy that was a fundamental aspect of the RTE Act, which previously mandated that no child could be held back until completing elementary education (Classes 1 to 8). This policy aimed to reduce dropout rates by promoting students regardless of their academic performance.
Promotion Criteria:
Under the new rules, students in Classes 5 and 8 can be detained if they do not pass their year-end exams. However, they will be given a second chance through a re-examination after receiving two months of additional teaching.
Implementation of Continuous Evaluation:
The amendment is intended to support better evaluation practices by allowing for regular assessments rather than relying solely on final examinations. This aims to ensure that students are adequately prepared before advancing to higher grades.
What have schools been allowed to do?
Detaining Students:
Schools can now hold back students in Classes 5 and 8 if they fail to meet the promotion criteria after a year-end examination. This marks a departure from the previous no-detention policy that prohibited such actions until the completion of elementary education.
Re-Examination Opportunities:
If a student does not pass the initial examination, they are given an opportunity for a re-examination within two months after receiving additional instruction. If they still do not meet the criteria after this second chance, they can be detained in their current class.
Monitoring and Support:
The rules require class teachers to identify learning gaps and provide specialized support to students who are at risk of being held back. The head of the school is also mandated to monitor the progress of these students.
Competency-Based Assessments:
The examinations and re-examinations are intended to be competency-based, focusing on holistic development rather than rote memorization.
Implementation Across Central Schools:
This amendment applies to around 3,000 central schools, including Kendriya Vidyalayas and Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, extending the option for detention beyond state-run schools.
Is there something wrong with the appraisal system?
Poor Implementation of Continuous Evaluation:
The original aim of continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE) was undermined by inadequate resources and training for teachers. Many schools failed to conduct meaningful assessments, leading to automatic promotions without evaluating students’ actual learning outcomes.
Lack of Accountability:
The previous no-detention policy created an environment where accountability for student performance diminished. Teachers often did not engage in effective monitoring or support for students struggling academically, resulting in significant learning gaps.
Focus on Final Examinations:
The shift towards allowing detention may lead to a renewed emphasis on final examinations rather than continuous assessment throughout the academic year, potentially reversing some of the progressive educational practices intended by the RTE Act.
Who should be made accountable?
Teachers:
Teachers should be held accountable for their students’ learning outcomes. They are crucial in identifying learning gaps, providing necessary support, and ensuring that all students receive adequate attention and instruction.
School Administrators:
School heads and administrators must monitor student progress and implement effective teaching strategies. They are responsible for creating an environment that encourages accountability among teachers and supports student learning.
Education Authorities:
Government bodies and education authorities at both state and national levels should be accountable for implementing educational policies effectively.
Parents and Communities:
Engaging parents and local communities in the educational process can enhance accountability.
Policymakers:
Lawmakers and policymakers must be accountable for creating a robust framework that supports quality education. This includes adequate funding, resource allocation, and the establishment of clear standards and expectations for schools.
What are some of the best ways to test a child’s learning? (Way forward)
Implement regular assessments through a mix of formative (ongoing, classroom-based) and summative (end-of-term) evaluations to track progress across cognitive, emotional, and social domains.
Skill-Based Assessments:
Focus on grade-appropriate competencies in reading, writing, and arithmetic through practical tasks, quizzes, and interactive activities, rather than relying solely on rote-based exams.
Individualized Feedback Mechanisms:
Use assessments that provide personalized insights into a child’s strengths and weaknesses, allowing for tailored remedial interventions to address specific learning gaps.
Mains PYQ:
The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 remains indadequate in promoting incentive-based system for children’s education without generating awareness about the importance of schooling. Analyse.

**********Why is rupee weakening against dollar?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Rupee depreciation;
Why in the News?
In the last week of December 2024, the rupee dropped below 85 against the U.S. dollar, hitting a new low of 85.81. The rupee fell by about 3% in 2024, continuing its long-term decline against the dollar.
What has caused the currency to depreciate?
Exit of Foreign Investors:
A significant driver of the rupee’s depreciation has been the exit of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from Indian markets. In 2024, FPIs pulled out substantial amounts from equities, leading to increased selling pressure on the rupee.
Widening Trade Deficit:
India’s trade deficit has widened due to high imports, particularly of crude oil and gold, compared to its exports. This increased demand for foreign currencies (like the U.S. dollar) to pay for these imports has contributed to the rupee’s weakening.
Monetary Policy Differences:
The Reserve Bank of India’s relatively looser monetary policy compared to the U.S. Federal Reserve has resulted in higher inflation rates in India. This inflation differential makes Indian assets less attractive to foreign investors, further reducing demand for the rupee.
Global Economic Factors:
Geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and rising global crude oil prices, have created volatility in the markets, leading to capital outflows from emerging markets like India.
The other reason is that the strengthening U.S. dollar amid higher U.S. bond yields has made investments in the U.S. more attractive compared to India.
What could be the impact of Rupee depreciation?
Increased Import Costs:
A weaker rupee raises the cost of imports, particularly for essential goods such as crude oil, fertilizers, and edible oils. This increase in import bills can lead to a higher overall trade deficit, which reached an all-time high of $37.8 billion in November 2024, exacerbating economic vulnerabilities.
Inflationary Pressures:
The rising costs of imported goods contribute to inflation, making everyday goods more expensive for consumers. This can lead to higher living costs and reduced purchasing power, as seen with the increased prices of food and fuel due to higher import expenses.
Impact on Economic Growth:
The combination of rising inflation and increased costs can dampen economic growth. Higher import bills can create upward pressure on interest rates, making borrowing more expensive and potentially slowing down investment and consumption.
Why made the central bank to intervene?
Stabilizing Currency Value:
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened in the forex market to stabilize the rupee and prevent excessive volatility that could disrupt economic stability. By selling dollars from its reserves, the RBI aimed to support the rupee’s value against the dollar.
Preventing Inflationary Pressures:
A depreciating rupee increases the cost of imports, particularly essential commodities like crude oil, which can exacerbate inflation domestically. The RBI’s intervention seeks to mitigate these inflationary pressures by maintaining a more stable exchange rate.
Maintaining Investor Confidence:
By actively managing the currency’s value, the RBI aims to instill confidence among investors regarding India’s economic stability and attractiveness as an investment destination. This is crucial for sustaining foreign investment inflows and supporting economic growth.
Way forward:
Diversify Export Markets and Reduce Dependence on Imports:
India should focus on enhancing its exports to non-traditional markets while exploring alternatives to reduce dependence on high-cost imports, especially crude oil and gold.
Monetary Policy Coordination and Strengthening Fundamentals:
The RBI should work towards aligning its monetary policy with global trends while ensuring domestic inflation remains under control.
Mains PYQ:
How would the recent phenomena of protectionism and currency manipulations in world trade affect macroeconomic stability of India?

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to health care;
Why in the News?
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer are rising sharply in India which causing a heavy financial burden. In 2022, NCDs accounted for 65% of all deaths.
Why should India shift its focus from curative to preventive healthcare?
Improved Health Outcomes:
Preventive healthcare allows for early detection and management of health issues, which can lead to better overall health, a higher quality of life, and potentially increased lifespan.
Early diagnosis helps mitigate serious complications associated with chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.
Cost Savings:
Investing in preventive care can significantly reduce healthcare costs. By preventing illnesses or catching them early, individuals can avoid expensive treatments and hospitalizations.
Reduced Burden on Healthcare Systems:
With a proactive approach to health, the pressure on India’s already strained healthcare infrastructure can be alleviated. Preventive care can help manage the rising incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which accounted for about 65% of deaths in 2022.
Economic Productivity:
A healthier population contributes to increased productivity. Chronic illnesses often lead to absenteeism and reduced work capacity, which can negatively impact economic growth.
Addressing Rising Disease Burden:
The growing prevalence of NCDs in India necessitates a shift toward preventive measures. With many individuals facing disease burdens earlier in life, focusing on prevention can help manage these conditions more effectively and sustainably.
How can India effectively shift its focus from curative to preventive healthcare?
Strengthening Early Intervention:
Enhancing the capabilities of Ayushman Health and Wellness Centres to facilitate targeted screenings and early interventions is crucial. This can involve using data analytics to identify high-risk populations and provide tailored preventive care services.
Encouraging Regular Screenings:
Promoting regular health screenings, especially for individuals aged 40-60, can help identify conditions early. Collaborating with private health providers and insurers to offer subsidized screening programs can make preventive care more accessible.
Policy Incentives:
Revising tax deductions for preventive health checks can incentivize individuals to prioritize their health. Increasing the limit from ₹5,000 to ₹15,000 under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act can encourage more people to undergo comprehensive health assessments.
What role do technology and innovation play in enhancing preventive healthcare accessibility?
AI and Digital Health Solutions:
The integration of AI-enabled imaging modalities and telemedicine can enhance the accessibility of preventive healthcare services. These technologies can facilitate lower-cost screenings and improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in underserved areas.
Health Data Management:
The National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) can play a pivotal role in managing health data effectively, enabling better tracking of health trends and facilitating targeted interventions based on population health analytics.
Wearable Health Devices:
The use of wearable devices for monitoring vital signs and health metrics can empower individuals to take proactive steps in managing their health, leading to earlier detection of potential health issues.
What are the expected economic and health outcomes of prioritizing preventive care?
Reduced Healthcare Costs:
By prioritizing preventive care, India could significantly lower the overall financial burden on individuals and the healthcare system.
Early diagnosis and intervention can prevent the escalation of diseases that require expensive treatments.
A focus on preventive healthcare is likely to lead to better health outcomes, including reduced morbidity and mortality rates associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This shift can enhance the quality of life for many individuals.
Economic Resilience:
Investing in preventive healthcare can contribute to economic stability by reducing productivity losses associated with chronic diseases. A healthier population is more productive, which can drive economic growth and reduce the financial strain on households.
Way forward:
Expand Preventive Care Infrastructure
: Strengthen health centers with early screening capabilities, utilize data analytics to identify high-risk groups, and collaborate with private providers to offer affordable preventive services.

Green Gross Domestic Product (Green GDP)
. This initiative highlights the critical role forests play in supporting both
environmental sustainability
and
economic growth
Highlights of the Chhattisgarh’s
Plan
Forest contributions like
carbon absorption
climate regulation
, and
biodiversity preservation
will now be formally quantified and included in the state’s economic planning.
The initiative ensures forests are valued not just for their resources but for their broader ecological services.
With
44% of its land
under forest cover, Chhattisgarh’s natural resources are vital for the livelihoods of millions and play a significant role in mitigating climate change.
The initiative aligns with
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Developed India 2047’ vision
, focusing on long-term ecological and economic sustainability.
About Green GDP
Green GDP is an
alternative metric
for assessing economic growth that includes the
environmental costs
of economic activities.
It subtracts the value of
natural resource depletion
environmental degradation
from traditional GDP to provide a more accurate picture of economic well-being.
Introduced in the
1993
United Nations Handbook of National Accounting: Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting
under the
System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA)
framework.
Key Features:
Aims to measure the
of economic growth.
Focuses on valuing ecosystem services like
carbon sequestration
soil conservation
water resources
Provides insights into the
trade-offs
between economic growth and environmental conservation.
Calculation:
Green GDP = Traditional GDP – Costs of Environmental Degradation – Costs of Resource Depletion.
Government Initiatives for Green GDP Accounting
Green National Account Framework:
It integrates environmental considerations into national accounting systems. It captures the value of natural resources, costs of pollution, and benefits of ecosystem services like clean air and water.
System of Environmental-Economic Accounting, 2012 (SEEA):
It was adopted by India under UN guidelines to create databases for natural capital accounting and informed policymaking.
RBI Estimates:
Green GDP for 2019 was ₹167 trillion, reflecting a 10% adjustment from traditional GDP. It is supported by organizations like TERI and Indian Statistical Institute to refine valuation methodologies.
Challenges in Implementing Green GDP
Lack of comprehensive and reliable data on environmental costs and ecosystem services.
Dependence on subjective assumptions reduces the accuracy of Green GDP estimates.
Assigning
monetary value
to ecosystem services like biodiversity, cultural heritage, and climate regulation is challenging.
Critics argue that such values may oversimplify or commodify
nature’s intrinsic worth
No universal framework exists for calculating Green GDP.
