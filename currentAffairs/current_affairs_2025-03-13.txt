Chagos has long been the subject of a dispute between Mauritius and the UK, which held on to these islands for decades after granting independence to Mauritius in 1968.
Key takeaways
The Chagos archipelago comprises more than 60 low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean roughly 1,600 km to the northeast of the main island of Mauritius. Diego Garcia is the largest island of the Chagos Archipelago.
Chagos was uninhabited for most of its history. The Portuguese used the Chagos islands as a stopover in voyages around the Cape of Good Hope to India. But it was only in the 18th century that the first permanent settlements emerged.
France became the first power to officially plant its flag on Chagos. The French had earlier set up Indian Ocean colonies in Île Bourbon (now Réunion) in 1665, Isle de France (now Mauritius) in 1715, and the Seychelles in 1744.
By 1786, a number of fishing settlements and coconut plantations was established. The labour for these enterprises was supplied by slaves from Mauritius, the Seychelles, Madagascar, and East Africa.
In 1814, after the fall of the Napoleonic Empire, France formally ceded Mauritius, including Chagos, and the Seychelles to Britain. After Britain abolished slavery in its colonies in 1833, indentured labour from India and Malaya was brought to the plantations.
The Chagossian population today traces its origins to freed African slaves, and the Indian and Malayan labourers who arrived in the 18th and 19th centuries. Under international law, they are the indigenous people of the Chagos archipelago.
British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) & Diego Garcia base
Mauritius became independent on March 12, 1968. But Britain kept control of Chagos.
In 1965, the UK had created a new administrative entity — the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) — which included the Chagos islands from Mauritius, and the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar, and Desroches from the Seychelles (these were restored to the Seychelles when the country received its independence in 1976).
In 1966, the UK and the US signed a secret agreement to establish a military base in Diego Garcia. In 1971, when the US began to construct the Diego Garcia base, islanders were forcibly deported to Mauritius and the Seychelles. The roughly 2,000-strong native population was expelled.
The 2024 agreement
In 2017, the UN General Assembly voted to ask the International Court of Justice to examine the legal status of the archipelago. The ICJ concluded that the UK is under an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago.
A deal was struck between the UK and Mauritius in 2024. Britain recognised Mauritius’ claim over all of Chagos, including Diego Garcia — however, the deal said that the UK would, for a 99-year initial period, exercise “the sovereign rights [over Diego Garcia] and authorities of Mauritius are required to ensure the continued operation of the base well into the next century”.

NATIONAL BOARD FOR WILDLIFE
Prelims & Mains – ENVIRONMENT
More than 10 years after assuming office, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired his first-ever meeting of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) last week.
The last full-body NBWL meeting was held on September 5, 2012, chaired by then PM Manmohan Singh. The PM is the ex officio chairman of the NBWL.
The present-day National Board for Wildlife was created in 2003 after amending The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
The NBWL is the country’s apex body on matters of framing wildlife policy, conservation of wildlife and forests, and on giving recommendations to set up new national parks and sanctuaries.
The NBWL consists of 47 members with the Prime Minister as its chairperson and the Union environment minister its vice-chairperson.
The NBWL has a standing committee, to which are delegated key tasks such as appraising projects situated on forest lands inside and around national parks and sanctuaries as well as projects within 10-km of protected areas.
The standing committee’s decisions are recommendatory, which the environment ministry can overrule.
Why has the board recently faced criticism?
Over the past decade, the NBWL has cleared several controversial projects in and around wildlife habitats. These include the Ken Betwa river linking project’s Daudhan Dam, which will submerge nearly 100 sqkm of Panna Tiger Reserve, and an oil exploration project of Vedanta in the eco-sensitive zone of the Hollongapar Gibbon sanctuary, home to the endangered Hoolock Gibbon, India’s only ape species. Also, in 2021, the Galathea Bay Sanctuary in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a nesting site of leatherback sea turtles, was denotified.
After the BJP came to power in 2014, the NBWL was reconstituted. The move faced allegations of dilution of powers, as only three non-governmental members were appointed.
The last standing committee of the UPA era had seven members not linked to the government — four conservation experts, and three representing non-governmental organisations.

RECESSION
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
US stocks have plunged, the constant talk of tariffs has caused uncertainty, and a survey has shown that mood among American consumers is pessimistic, even as an economic adviser to President Donald Trump has dismissed talks of a recession in the US economy.
At its simplest, in any economy, a recessionary phase is the counterpart of an expansionary phase.
When the overall output of goods and services — typically measured by the GDP — increases from one quarter (or month) to another, the economy is said to be in an expansionary phase. And when the GDP contracts from one quarter to another, the economy is said to be in a recessionary phase.
Together, these two phases create what is called a “business cycle” in any economy. A full business cycle could last anywhere between one year and a decade.
When a recessionary phase sustains for long enough, it is called a recession. In other words, when the GDP contracts for a long enough period, the economy is said to be in a recession.
There is no universally accepted definition of a recession — as in, for how long should the GDP contract before an economy is said to be in a recession. But most economists agree with the definition that the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in the United States uses.
According to NBER, “During a recession, a significant decline in economic activity spreads across the economy and can last from a few months to more than a year”.
The NBER typically looks at various variables — employment, consumption etc — apart from GDP growth to arrive at a decision. It also looks at the “depth, diffusion, and duration” of decline in economic activity to determine whether an economy is in a recession or not.
Economic commentators also use the word technical recession. A technical recession occurs when a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracts for two consecutive quarters (i.e., two successive three-month periods)

OVERSEAS CITIZEN OF INDIA (OCI)
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s presented the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card to his Mauritius counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam and termed it a “proof of friendship” between two nations.
The Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) scheme was introduced in 2005 through an amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955, to allow certain categories of foreign nationals of Indian origin to register as OCIs.
The Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card grants several privileges similar to Indian citizens but does not confer full citizenship.
Following categories of foreign nationals are eligible for registration as Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) Cardholder –

Exemptions: They are exempt from registering with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) regardless of the duration of their stay.
Restrictions on OCI
No Political Rights: OCI cardholders cannot vote, hold constitutional offices (e.g., President, Vice-President, Judge of Supreme Court/High Court).
The OCI Cardholder shall not be entitled for appointment to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State except for appointment in such services and posts as the Central Government may, by special order, in that behalf, specify.
No Agricultural Land: They cannot purchase agricultural or plantation properties in India.
Revocation of OCI: The OCI card can be revoked if the holder violates Indian laws or engages in activities prejudicial to India’s interests.
OCI vs. Dual Citizenship
India does not allow dual citizenship under the Citizenship Act, 1955.
OCI is not dual citizenship but a form of permanent residency with limited rights.
OCI cardholders retain their foreign citizenship while enjoying certain benefits in India.

VENTURE CAPITAL
Prelims – ECONOMY
India’s venture capital (VC) market experienced a sharp resurgence in 2024, with total funding reaching $13.7 billion, marking a 1.4x increase from 2023.
Several regulatory changes in 2024 created a more favourable investment environment, including the removal of the angel tax, reduction in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax rates, streamlining of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) process, and simplification of foreign venture capital investor (FVCI) registrations.
Venture Capital (VC) is a form of private equity financing provided to startups and small businesses that have high growth potential.
It plays a crucial role in fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic development by providing capital to early-stage companies.
Key Features of Venture Capital
High-Risk, High-Reward: Venture capital investments are risky because they are made in unproven businesses, but they offer the potential for substantial returns if the startup succeeds.
Equity Stake: In exchange for funding, venture capitalists (VCs) receive an equity stake in the company.
Active Involvement: VCs often provide mentorship, strategic guidance, and access to networks, in addition to funding.
Stages of Funding: VC is provided at different stages, including seed funding, early-stage, and expansion-stage financing.
VC funds in India are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under the Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) Regulations, 2012.

**********Behind ASHA protests in Kerala - Demand for hike in honorariums, other benefits
Why in news?
Opposition MPs from Kerala protested in Parliament, demanding higher honorariums and retirement benefits for ASHA workers. The leaders highlighted that ASHAs earn only ₹233 per day, often irregularly.
In response, Health Minister J P Nadda stated that the NHM Steering Group had approved increased incentives, which would be implemented soon.
What’s in today’s article?
Role of ASHAs in Rural Healthcare
Earnings of ASHAs
ASHA Honorariums: Kerala vs Other States
ASHA stands for
ccredited
ocial
ctivist
ASHAs are community health workers who are part of India's National Rural Health Mission (
NRHM
).
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) employs them.
Launch of ASHAs
NRHM launched ASHAs in 2005 as community health functionaries working alongside Anganwadi workers under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS).
In 2013, NRHM and the National Urban Health Mission were merged into the
National Health Mission (NHM)
Responsibilities of ASHAs
Serve as the first point of contact for marginalized communities, particularly women and children, for healthcare needs.
Promote awareness of good health practices and assist in accessing public health services.
Support maternal and childcare, immunization drives, family planning, and disease prevention programs.
Conduct periodic home visits and maintain health records.
Selection Criteria
Women aged 25-45, preferably married, widowed, or divorced.
Minimum education qualification of Class 10.
Selection involves gram panchayats, Anganwadi institutions, community groups, and self-help groups.
Coverage and Workforce
One ASHA is assigned per 1,000 people.
As of 2022-23, India had 9.2 lakh rural ASHAs and approximately 79,900 urban ASHAs.
The highest number of ASHAs are in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh.
Volunteer Status and Payment Structure
Initially, ASHAs were considered honorary volunteers whose work was designed not to interfere with their livelihood.
However, many now work full-time as they serve as the first point of contact for marginalized households.
Despite this,
the NHM still classifies them as volunteers, making them ineligible for fixed salaries beyond task-based incentives
Monthly Incentives and Honorarium
ASHAs receive a
monthly incentive of ₹3,000
, shared between the Centre and the state.
Payment is tied to completing specific tasks and is often not fully disbursed.
Kerala ASHAs get
₹500 for the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram
(early childcare scheme), but its applicability is limited in areas with low childbirth rates.
State-Specific Honorarium and Task-Based Earnings
Kerala, ASHAs receive a monthly honorarium of ₹7,000
, funded by the state.
Payment depends on completing
10 tasks
, such as running clinics and maintaining ward reports, each valued at ₹700.
Additional
task-based incentives vary
depending on different national health schemes and their applicability in specific areas.
Kerala Health Minister Veena George stated that the state offers the highest honorarium to ASHAs.
However, some states provide higher payments and additional benefits.
Sikkim:
Paying
₹10,000
per month since October 2022.
Andhra Pradesh:

**********NASA Successfully Launches Twin Missions to Study Sun, History of Universe
Why in news?
NASA successfully launched the SPHEREx and PUNCH space missions from California after multiple delays.
PUNCH, a solar mission comprising four small satellites, was deployed 10 minutes after launch. It will capture detailed 3D images of the solar corona, study solar winds, and improve space weather predictions.
What’s in today’s article?
Key Aspects of the SPHEREx Space Telescope
Key Highlights of the PUNCH Mission
pectro-
hotometer for the
istory of the Universe,
poch of
eionization and Ices
plorer (SPHEREx) entered a sun-synchronous orbit 650 km above Earth.
This mission will collect data from 450 million galaxies and 100 million stars to create a detailed 3D sky map and study the universe's history.
Creating the Most Colorful Map of the Cosmos
SPHEREx will map the universe using both optical and infrared light.
While the human eye can see optical light, infrared reveals hidden details like distant galaxies, star formation, and galactic structures.
Unlike the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which focuses on specific regions, SPHEREx will scan the entire sky every six months in 102 infrared colors, providing an unprecedented view of the cosmos.
Studying Cosmic Inflation
SPHEREx aims to shed light on cosmic inflation, a rapid expansion of the universe that occurred 14 billion years ago.
By mapping the 3D positions of 450 million galaxies, the telescope will help scientists test theories about this mysterious phenomenon, improving our understanding of the universe’s origins.
Identifying Life-Forming Molecules in the Milky Way
SPHEREx will search for biogenic molecules, such as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, frozen in icy particles across the Milky Way.
These molecules are essential for life and may have travelled to Earth from deep space.
By mapping their locations, scientists hope to uncover how these molecules contributed to the formation of life.
Polarimetry to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH)
mission, a solar mission comprising four small satellites, was deployed 10 minutes after launch.
First 3D Imaging of the Solar Corona Using Polarized Light
PUNCH is the first solar mission designed to use
polarized light to measure the solar corona and solar wind in 3D
Polarized light consists of waves vibrating in a single plane, unlike unpolarized light, which oscillates in multiple directions.
It occurs naturally (e.g., sky scattering) or through filters like sunglasses and scientific instruments.
The mission will provide overlapped
heliospheric-coronagraphic imaging
, allowing scientists to study the continuous flow of solar winds without distinct boundaries.
Importance for Space Weather Prediction
Solar winds and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can disrupt satellite communications, GPS navigation, and power grids on Earth.
PUNCH’s data will enhance space weather predictions, helping protect Earth’s technology and space missions.
High-Resolution 3D Imaging Using Four Cameras
PUNCH consists of three Wide Field Imagers (WFI) and one Narrow Field Imager that capture images of the sun’s corona every four minutes using polarizing filters.
These images will be combined to create a detailed 3D map of the solar wind’s structure and evolution.
Understanding Solar Wind and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)
PUNCH will help scientists identify where solar winds and CMEs originate, how they accelerate, and their journey through interplanetary space.
This will improve timely space weather forecasting and help understand the forces acting in the corona.
Unique Virtual Instrument Approach
Unlike previous solar missions, PUNCH’s four-camera system operates as a single virtual instrument, generating large-scale imagery data to provide an unprecedented 3D view of the sun’s outer atmosphere.

**********The Online Gaming Sector: A Growing Opportunity
Why in the News?
The Economic Survey 2024-25 has called for “accelerating and amplifying the deregulation agenda”, and has urged the government to “get out of the way” so that businesses can go about their business.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Online Gaming (Context, Burden of High Taxation, Legality Issues, Challenges, Way Forward, etc.)
Introduction:
The Indian online gaming industry has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years, emerging as a major contributor to the country’s digital economy.
With over
650 million smartphone users
and a predominantly young population, India has the potential to become a global leader in
skill-based gaming
PwC report
estimated that the sector, valued at
₹33,000 crore in 2023
, is projected to grow at a
CAGR of 14.5%
, reaching
₹66,000 crore by 2028
The industry is also expected to generate
2-3 lakh new jobs
in the coming years, supplementing the
2 lakh jobs
already created.
However, despite its potential,
government regulations and taxation policies
have put the sector under significant pressure.
The Burden of High Taxation:
While some Indian states, such as
Karnataka and Telangana
, have initiated policies to promote the
animation, gaming, and visual effects (AVGC) sector
, the central and state governments have imposed
hefty taxation measures
that threaten the industry’s viability.
28% GST
on online gaming has been imposed - similar to taxation on
gambling, alcohol, and tobacco
This classification fails to recognize that skill-based online gaming is distinct from gambling.
Moreover, a
retrospective tax demand of ₹1.12 lakh crore
has been levied on gaming companies, pushing smaller startups to the brink of closure.
Legal Confusion: Gaming vs. Gambling:
State governments have also attempted to
ban online gaming
, equating it with
, which led to multiple legal battles.
Courts have ruled in favour of online gaming companies, stating that
“games of skill”
cannot be classified as gambling.
The Supreme Court even stayed the
retrospective GST demand
in 2025.
ongoing regulatory uncertainty
continues to discourage investment and innovation in the sector.
Challenges Faced by the Industry:
Excessive Taxation
: The
makes Indian gaming companies less competitive than their global counterparts.
Legal Uncertainty
: Frequent bans and judicial battles create an unpredictable business environment.
Lack of Distinction Between Gaming and Gambling
: The government's failure to differentiate between skill-based gaming and gambling causes regulatory confusion.
Threat to Small Startups
: Many small and mid-sized gaming firms are struggling to survive under the financial burden of high taxation and compliance costs.
Growth of Offshore Illegal Gambling
: Harsh regulations on legitimate gaming companies could push users towards illegal
offshore betting platforms
, which are beyond the reach of Indian regulators.
The Way Forward: A Balanced Regulatory Approach
Instead of burdening the industry with excessive taxation and legal uncertainty, the government should
adopt a more collaborative approach
Policymakers should work alongside industry leaders to create a
clear regulatory framework
that supports innovation while addressing concerns like addiction and financial transparency.
Key Recommendations:
Rationalize GST rates
to make taxation fair and sustainable.
Create a clear legal distinction
between online skill-based gaming and gambling.
Drop the retrospective tax demand
, which threatens to collapse the industry.
Encourage responsible gaming practices
with in-app safeguards against excessive usage.
Strengthen monitoring mechanisms
to curb illegal gambling rather than penalizing legitimate businesses.
Conclusion:
India’s online gaming sector holds
immense potential
to contribute to economic growth, job creation, and technological innovation. However,
onerous taxation and inconsistent regulations
are acting as roadblocks.
The government must balance
regulation with growth
to ensure that India’s gaming industry thrives in the global market.

**********Challenges in India’s Electoral Process and the Role of the Election Commission
Context:
The Election Commission of India (
ECI
) recently acknowledged and committed to resolving the issue of
multiple voters
carrying the
same
Electors Photo Identification Card
(EPIC) number.
This long-pending problem is part of
broader concerns regarding the electoral process in India
, including electoral roll anomalies, the reliability of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), and the transparency of Form 17C.
These issues, collectively termed as the ‘
Infernal Trinity,
’ impact the integrity of India’s democratic process.
Key Issues in India’s Electoral Process:
Electoral roll anomalies:
The electoral roll
is fundamental to voting rights, as having an EPIC alone does not guarantee the ability to vote if the name is missing from the roll.
of electoral rolls has been
questioned
due to
unexplained deletions and additions.
Political parties have raised concerns over
sudden spikes in voter registration
, as seen in
Maharashtra
in 2024, and the deletions/additions to the
Delhi
electoral roll.
Proposed solution:
Sukumar Sen
, India’s first Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), delayed the first general elections to ensure roll accuracy, setting a precedent that must be upheld.
The ECI should mandate
Electoral Registration Officers (EROs)
to publish a list of polling stations where voter changes exceed 2-3% of the previous list.
This list should be
accessible on ECI websites
, allowing scrutiny by political parties and the public.
Transparency in Form 17C Data:
Concerns:
records the number of votes polled at each booth and is given to polling agents.
There have been concerns about the
delay in publishing voter turnout data.
Transparency can be improved by
uploading polling station-wise data
on the ECI website after scrutiny by election officials.
Ensuring
prompt online publication
of polling data to eliminate doubts and prevent controversy.
Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Trust Deficit:
While courts have largely upheld the reliability of EVMs,
doubts persist among political groups and civil society.
The distinction between
‘whether EVMs have been manipulated’ and ‘whether they can be manipulated’ remains a topic of debate.
Proposed solutions:
Conducting random
100% Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slip counts
in selected constituencies.
Publishing the source code of EVMs
(a long-discussed proposal) to enhance transparency.
Proactively engaging with critics
rather than dismissing concerns outright.
The Role of the Election Commission:
The ECI plays a crucial role in ensuring
free and fair elections
Its credibility has come under scrutiny
due to allegations of
selective enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC)
and reluctance to address electoral roll discrepancies.
To restore public trust
, the ECI must:
Strengthen its commitment to
impartiality
Enhance
in voter registration and turnout data.
Address concerns over EVMs through proactive engagement and
reforms
Conclusion:
The ECI is
at a critical juncture
addressing systemic electoral concerns
is essential for
upholding democracy
Proactive reforms, increased transparency, and a commitment to questioning and improving its own processes can help the Commission emerge stronger and regain public confidence.

Editorial Analysis
**********The Dangerous Illusion Cast by Development Rankings
Context
California’s devastating wildfires serve as a stark reminder
of the consequences of unsustainable development models.
With economic damages estimated at around $250 billion
, these disasters highlight the hidden costs of industrialized nations’ lifestyles.
modern world’s approach to development, often represented by indices such as the Human Development Index (HDI)
, promotes an aspirational model that ignores its severe ecological impact.
Now it becomes
imperative to explore the shortcomings of existing development metrics,
the environmental consequences of high-income nations’ consumption patterns, and the potential of alternative models.
The Flaws of Traditional Development Metrics
Missing the Oversight of Environmental Sustainability
HDI ranks countries primarily on human well-being indicators
without considering how these outcomes are achieved.
Nations like Norway, Switzerland, and Ireland consistently top the index,
but they are also among the world’s biggest resource consumers and carbon emitters per capita.
Their high rankings create the illusion that their development models are universally replicable,
when in reality, their levels of consumption are environmentally unsustainable.
If all countries aspired to the same levels of resource
as these high-ranking nations,
the planet’s finite ecological capacity would be overwhelmed.
Studies suggest that
if the entire world consumed resources at the rate of the United States or the European Union, we would require multiple Earths
to sustain such a lifestyle.
The Problem with the Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI (PHDI)
In response to longstanding criticism, the
United Nations introduced the PHDI in 2020
This modified index adjusts HDI scores downward for nations with high ecological footprints,
attempting to integrate sustainability concerns into development measurement.
While this is a step in the right direction, it remains
fundamentally inadequate
for several reasons.
Relative Comparison Rather than Absolute Limits
The PHDI still ranks countries only
in relation to one another
rather than against
absolute ecological thresholds
This means that countries like Norway and Sweden, which consume over five Earths’ worth of resources per capita, continue to score highly, not because they are truly sustainable, but because other countries (such as Qatar) perform even worse.
This relativist approach
obscures the true scale of ecological overshoot
Failure to Encourage Systemic Change
does not incentivise wealthier nations to radically reduce their environmental impact
Instead, it merely differentiates countries based on their relative environmental damage, which does little to challenge unsustainable consumption patterns.
Limited Scope of Planetary Pressures Considered
While the PHDI adjusts for carbon emissions and material consumption, it does not
fully account for broader ecological crises
such as biodiversity loss, freshwater depletion, and soil degradation, all of which are crucial to planetary stability.
As a result, the PHDI remains a
surface-level improvement
that does not fundamentally alter the dominant development paradigm.
It allows affluent nations to maintain their positions at the top while
continuing unsustainable practices.
The Myth of Development as a Universal Pathway
The HDI and PHDI promote the idea that
all nations should strive toward the same developmental trajectory
, one defined by increasing industrialization, urbanization, and high per capita income.
However, this
Western-centric model
ignores the realities of planetary limits and
the diverse socio-economic contexts of different regions
Ignoring Alternative Development Models
The HDI fails to recognize that some middle-income countries, such as Costa Rica, have achieved
high human well-being with a much lower ecological footprint
By prioritising economic indicators, it
reinforces a model that equates higher income with better development
, rather than considering sustainability as a central factor.
Economic Growth as an End Goal
By emphasising
income levels as a key component of development
, the HDI promotes the assumption that higher GDP per capita always leads to a better quality of life.
However, research shows that
after a certain threshold, additional economic growth does not necessarily translate to greater well-being
Instead, excessive consumption often leads to environmental degradation, social inequalities, and declining life satisfaction.
The Environmental Costs of High-Income Lifestyles
High-income nations have
already exceeded multiple planetary boundaries
, including greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and pollution.
This disconnect
, between celebrated economic success and environmental reality creates
a misleading narrative that encourages unsustainable aspirations.
The consequences of this flawed model are becoming increasingly visible
. Climate disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, and rising sea levels are direct results of unchecked carbon emissions and ecological destruction.
The costs of these disasters, both economic and human, highlight the urgent need to rethink progress
beyond traditional economic indicators.
The Way Forward
Middle-Income Countries as Alternative Models
Rather than emulating high-income nations,
developing countries should look to middle-income nations that have achieved significant human development
without excessive ecological harm.
Countries such as Costa Rica and Sri Lanka offer alternative pathways
that balance economic growth with environmental and social sustainability.
Costa Rica, for example, has made strategic investments in renewable energy and forest conservation
while ensuring high literacy rates, universal healthcare, and long-life expectancy.
Its sustainable policies demonstrate
that progress does not have to come at the expense of the environment.
Similarly, Sri Lanka has achieved relatively high human development indicators
compared to its South Asian neighbours through investments in health and education.
However, its recent economic crisis and history of political instability underscore the
importance of social and political justice
alongside environmental considerations.
A Sustainable Path for India and the Developing World
For India, a country with a population of 1.4 billion
, replicating the consumption patterns of affluent
nations is neither feasible nor desirable.
India must seek development pathways that prioritise ecological sustainability,
equitable resource distribution, and social justice.
While models like those of Costa Rica and Sri Lanka are not perfect, they offer valuable lessons
in creating a more sustainable and just society.
Redefining progress in the 21st century
requires moving beyond GDP growth and HDI rankings.
True development should ensure that all citizens live with dignity
while remaining within the planet’s ecological limits.
This is not just an ethical ideal but a practical necessity
for survival in an era of accelerating climate change.
Conclusion
traditional models of development
championed by high-income nations, are fundamentally flawed
as they ignore the environmental destruction required to sustain them.
The HDI and even the modified PHDI fail to provide an accurate measure
of true progress because they do not consider absolute ecological limits.
Instead of aspiring to these unsustainable models,
developing nations must explore alternative approaches that balance economic growth with environmental responsibility

Editorial Analysis
**********What the Recent GDP Data Revisions Reveal
Context
The
National Statistical Office (NSO) released its latest national accounts data on February 28, 2025
, presenting crucial insights into India's economic growth.
The report includes
revised Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross Value Added (GVA)
estimates for the
fiscal years 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25,
alongside third-quarter (Q3) GDP/GVA estimates for 2024-25.
Amid these reports,
it is important to examine the key trends, sectoral performances, annual revisions, and future growth prospects
based on the data.
Third Quarter Growth and Sectoral Performance
India's GDP growth in Q3 of 2024-25 was recorded at
6.2%
, marking an improvement over the
5.6%
growth in the second quarter.
Sectoral analysis highlights notable disparities.
Agriculture
experienced
robust growth of 5.6%
, reinforcing its resilience in the economy.
Manufacturing
, while improving slightly from
2.1% in Q2 to 3.5% in Q3
, remains sluggish.
The services sector
, particularly trade, hospitality, and related industries, demonstrated an upward trend, with growth increasing from
6.1% in Q2 to 6.7% in Q3
Concerns Regarding Quarterly Data
A key question arising from the quarterly data is the sharp drop in Q2 growth to
and the feasibility of achieving an estimated
7.6% growth in Q4
The primary driver behind the Q2 decline was the slowdown in
Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE)
, whose contribution fell from
4.3 to 3.3 percentage points
Achieving the projected Q4 growth requires
PFCE growth of 9.9%
, a level not witnessed in recent years.
Similarly, investment contributions also fluctuated, falling from
2.3 percentage points in Q1 to 1.8 in Q3
, which contributed to slower GDP growth.
Challenges to Fourth Quarter Growth Projections and Annual GDP Revisions and Sectoral Adjustments
A crucial factor influencing Q4 growth will be
government investment
The Controller General of Accounts (CGA) reported that as of January 2025, the Government of India had incurred
₹7.57 lakh crore
in capital expenditure.
To meet the revised estimate of
₹10.18 lakh crore
, an additional
₹2.61 lakh crore
must be spent in the final two months of the fiscal year.
However, historical trends suggest that average government expenditure in February and March has been only
₹1.81 lakh crore
, raising doubts about meeting the required investment target.
If capital expenditure falls short, the
7.6% Q4 growth projection may not be achieved
, leading to a potential downward revision of the full-year growth estimate of
6.5%
The revised annual GDP data indicate an
upward revision
in both real and nominal growth rates:
Real GDP growth
is now estimated at
7.6%, 9.2%, and 6.5%
, respectively.
The revision in
2023-24 growth
8.2% to 9.2%
and in
GVA growth from 7.2% to 8.6%
was primarily driven by
manufacturing and financial services
, which saw upward revisions of
2.4 and 1.9 percentage points
However, the
sharp decline in 2024-25 growth compared to 2023-24 (a drop of 2.7 percentage points)
is primarily due to a
slowdown in gross capital formation
10.5% to 5.8%
This reflects a
reduction in investment activity
, which is critical for sustaining long-term economic expansion.
The revised GDP data also impact the
Incremental Capital-Output Ratio (ICOR)
, which measures investment efficiency.
The ICOR for
is estimated at
4.8, 4.0, and 5.5
The decline in
indicated better capital efficiency, but the 2024-25 increase suggests a return to less efficient capital utilisation.
Future Economic Prospects: 2025-26 and Beyond
The nominal GDP growth projections for 2025-26 suggest a potentially
higher growth rate than the Budget assumption of 10.1%
Economic Survey
estimates a
real GDP growth range of 6.3%-6.8%
, with a mid-point of
6.55%
Achieving this requires
strong government investment
, as private investment is still recovering amid global uncertainties.
A key area of debate is whether
private consumption should drive growth
Some argue that increasing the
PFCE-to-GDP ratio
would boost demand and accelerate growth.
However, this would simultaneously lead to a decline in
investment demand
, potentially undermining long-term growth sustainability.
overall nominal saving rate was 30.7%
, below the
pre-COVID average of 31.2% (2015-16 to 2019-20)
Thus, increasing
savings and investment rates
should be a priority for sustaining medium-term growth.
real investment rate
(Gross Fixed Capital Formation to GDP) for
33.4%
, which, with an ICOR of
5.1
, yields a
potential growth rate of 6.5%
. Therefore,
investment-led growth remains the best long-term strategy
for India.
The Way Forward
Looking ahead,
2025-26 growth prospects appear stable at around 6.5%
, contingent on
robust government investment
gradual recovery in private investment
The long-term strategy should focus on
enhancing savings and investment rates
, ensuring that India maintains its growth momentum amidst global economic uncertainties.
Conclusion
India’s GDP growth trajectory in
reflects both
strengths and challenges
. While
Q3 growth of 6.2%

(2020).
California recently faced devastating wildfires, causing around $250 billion in damage—close to Greece’s GDP in 2023. This reveals the hidden costs of development in wealthy nations. If all countries consumed resources like the U.S. or EU, we would need multiple Earths. Yet, the HDI still promotes these unsustainable models as ideals, ignoring ecological realities.
Today’s editorial talks about how the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI (PHDI) give a misleading view of progress. This topic is useful for GS Paper 2 and GS Paper 3 in the UPSC Mains exam.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Indicators like the United Nations’ HDI and PHDI overlook the fact that Earth has limited resources, promoting development models that may harm the environment and exceed planetary boundaries.
How does the Human Development Index (HDI) create a misguided perception of progress?
Ignores Environmental Impact:
HDI measures life expectancy, education, and income but does not account for the environmental damage caused by development.
Example:
Countries like the United States and Norway have high HDI scores despite being among the largest carbon emitters and resource consumers.
Promotes Unsustainable Consumption Patterns:
It celebrates the lifestyles of affluent countries without considering whether these consumption patterns can be replicated globally.
If every country consumed resources like the European Union, we would need multiple Earths to sustain global life.
Overlooks Inequality and Social Justice:
HDI does not reflect internal inequalities within countries, masking disparities in wealth distribution and social justice.
Despite India’s improving HDI score, significant inequalities exist between rural and urban populations in access to education and healthcare.
Creates a One-Size-Fits-All Model of Development:
It assumes that higher incomes and longer life expectancy automatically equate to better development, disregarding cultural and ecological diversity.
Countries like Costa Rica achieve high life expectancy and literacy with a low ecological footprint, offering a sustainable development model.
Fails to Recognize Planetary Boundaries:
HDI does not measure whether a country’s development exceeds ecological limits, encouraging a pursuit of progress at the cost of environmental sustainability.
Example,
Nordic countries maintain top HDI rankings despite consuming resources equivalent to five Earths per capita.
What is Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI (PHDI)?
is a modified version of the
introduced by the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
It adjusts a country’s HDI score by accounting for the environmental impact of its development, particularly focusing on
carbon emissions
material consumption
Why did the United Nations introduce the Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI (PHDI)?
To Address Environmental Sustainability:
The PHDI was introduced to account for the environmental pressures caused by high levels of human development, such as carbon emissions and resource consumption.
Countries with high HDI scores, like the United States and Australia, receive lower PHDI rankings due to their significant carbon footprints.
To Provide a More Holistic Measure of Progress:
It aims to offer a more comprehensive understanding of development by balancing human well-being with environmental responsibility.
While Norway ranks highly on the HDI, its PHDI score is reduced because of its high per-capita ecological impact.
To Encourage Sustainable Development Models:
The PHDI highlights the need for nations to pursue progress within planetary boundaries, promoting more sustainable policy frameworks.
Costa Rica, with its focus on renewable energy and forest conservation, maintains a more balanced PHDI compared to other high-income countries.
What should be the true meaning of progress for developing nations like India?
Sustainable Development within Ecological Limits:
Progress should balance
economic growth
, ensuring the responsible use of natural resources without depleting them for future generations.
India’s National Solar Mission
aims to increase renewable energy capacity while reducing dependence on fossil fuels, promoting cleaner and sustainable progress.
Inclusive and Equitable Growth:
Development must ensure
by reducing inequalities and providing access to
basic services
like healthcare, education, and employment for all sections of society.
Aspirational Districts Programme
focuses on improving underdeveloped areas by enhancing healthcare, education, and infrastructure, fostering inclusive growth.
Quality of Life and Human Dignity:
True progress prioritizes
, ensuring that every citizen lives with dignity and has access to a safe, healthy, and fulfilling life.
Swachh Bharat Mission
improved sanitation across rural India, enhancing public health and ensuring better living conditions.
Why should developing countries like India adopt a different vision of progress?
Environmental Sustainability and Resource Limits:
Following the
Western model
of high consumption is unsustainable for resource-rich but ecologically vulnerable countries. Developing nations must prioritize
sustainable practices
to avoid environmental degradation.
India’s Green Hydrogen Mission
aims to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote clean energy, aligning growth with environmental conservation.
Addressing Social Inequalities:
A different vision of progress focuses on
reducing socio-economic disparities
by ensuring equitable access to basic services like healthcare, education, and livelihoods.
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
promotes financial inclusion by providing banking services to marginalized communities, fostering inclusive development.
What are the steps taken by the Indian government?
National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)
(2008): Includes eight missions focusing on renewable energy, water conservation, and sustainable agriculture.
aims to achieve 280 GW of solar power by 2030.
(2023): Promotes the use of green hydrogen to reduce fossil fuel dependency and cut carbon emissions.
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)
(2014): Provides banking access to the unbanked population, enhancing financial inclusion.
Ayushman Bharat (PM-JAY)
(2018): Provides health coverage to over 500 million people, ensuring access to quality healthcare for low-income groups.
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)
(2005): This guarantees 100 days of wage employment per year to rural households, ensuring livelihood security.
Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana
(2014): Focuses on skill development and employment for rural and urban poor.
Way forward:
Adopt a Balanced Development Approach:
Integrate environmental sustainability with social and economic policies, ensuring that progress respects planetary boundaries while addressing socio-economic disparities.
Strengthen initiatives like the Green Hydrogen Mission and promote circular economy practices to reduce ecological footprints.
Enhance Social Equity and Human Well-being:
Prioritize inclusive growth by improving access to quality healthcare, education, and employment for all, especially marginalized communities.
Expand programs like Ayushman Bharat and Skill India Mission to ensure equitable opportunities and better living standards.

**********Resolving the vexatious Fishing dispute
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India Sri Lanka relations;
Why in the News?
Last week, Bimal Rathnayake, the Leader of the House in Sri Lanka’s Parliament and the country’s Transport and Highways Minister, urged the Indian and Tamil Nadu governments to take strong action against illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters.
How do domestic factors in both India and Sri Lanka influence their respective foreign policies concerning the fishing dispute?
For India:
Livelihood Dependency and Economic Pressure:
Thousands of fishermen in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry rely on fishing in the Palk Bay for their livelihoods. Limited fishing zones and declining fish stocks in Indian waters push them into Sri Lankan territory.
Example:
Fishermen from districts like Ramanathapuram and Nagapattinam regularly cross the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) due to insufficient catch within Indian waters.
Political and Electoral Pressures:
Tamil Nadu’s regional parties, such as the DMK and AIADMK, often raise the fishing dispute to secure voter support, pressuring the central government to prioritize the issue in foreign policy.
Before elections, Tamil Nadu politicians routinely demand stronger diplomatic efforts to release Indian fishermen detained by the Sri Lankan Navy.
Legal and Regulatory Constraints:
Indian regulations, like the Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Act (1983), restrict the use of mechanized boats close to the shore, limiting fishing areas and driving fishermen toward Sri Lankan waters.
The 1983 Act bans trawling within three nautical miles of the Indian coastline, making deeper Sri Lankan waters more attractive despite the legal risks.
For Srilanka:
Protection of Northern Province Fishermen’s Livelihoods:
Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen in the Northern Province rely on traditional fishing methods and face competition from Indian trawlers, which threatens their livelihoods.
Post-Civil War Economic Recovery:
The Northern Province, which was heavily affected by the civil war, is still recovering economically. Safeguarding local fishing areas is seen as vital for the region’s rehabilitation and economic stability.
The Sri Lankan government prioritizes protecting fishing zones to support the economic revival of communities affected by the civil war.
Political and Nationalist Sentiments:
There is domestic pressure on the Sri Lankan government to take a strong stance against perceived violations of territorial waters, especially from nationalist groups and local political parties.
In 2015, then-Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe defended the Sri Lankan Navy’s actions against Indian fishermen, reflecting nationalist sentiments on protecting maritime boundaries.
Why is resolving the “festering Palk Bay sheries dispute” considered crucial for the Tamil-speaking fishermen of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province?
Protection of Livelihoods:
Tamil-speaking fishermen in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province depend on local marine resources for their survival. Illegal fishing by Indian trawlers reduces fish stocks, threatening their primary source of income.
Frequent incursions by Indian fishermen using bottom trawling disrupt the local fishing economy, making it difficult for Sri Lankan fishermen to sustain their livelihoods.
Environmental Sustainability:
Bottom trawling by Indian fishermen causes severe damage to marine ecosystems, affecting fish breeding and long-term marine biodiversity.
The destruction of fish habitats due to bottom trawling reduces future fish yields, directly impacting the sustainability of fishing communities in the Northern Province.
Socio-Economic Recovery Post-Civil War:
The Northern Province is still recovering from the socio-economic impacts of Sri Lanka’s civil war. Protecting their fishing waters is vital for long-term economic stability and community rebuilding.
Ensuring exclusive access to local waters helps these communities rebuild their economy and strengthens their post-war rehabilitation efforts.
What role can India play in resolving the Palk Bay fishing dispute? (Way forward)
Promoting Sustainable Fishing Practices:
India can encourage and support its fishermen to adopt sustainable fishing methods, reducing the harmful impact of bottom trawling in Sri Lankan waters.
Expanding the
Palk Bay deep-sea fishing scheme
and integrating it with the
Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana
can help Indian fishermen transition to deep-sea fishing, reducing pressure on the Palk Bay region.
Facilitating Bilateral Talks:
India can work with Sri Lanka to resume and mediate talks between fishermen from both countries, fostering dialogue and finding mutually beneficial solutions.
India previously supported
fishermen-level talks
in 2016, which allowed both sides to voice concerns and seek collaborative solutions. Restarting such discussions can ease tensions.
Strengthening Legal and Diplomatic Cooperation:
India can strengthen legal frameworks and diplomatic channels to enforce maritime boundaries while ensuring the protection of its fishermen’s rights.
Joint Working Group on Fisheries
(established in 2016) provides a platform for both governments to discuss and implement measures to prevent illegal fishing and resolve disputes amicably.
Mains PYQ:
In respect of India-Sri Lanka relations, discuss how do mestic factors influence foreign policy.
