Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)
India signs clean, fair economy agreements of IPEF
Background: Origin
US President Biden first spoke about the IPEF at the October 2021 East Asia Summit.
At this summit, he said that the United States will explore with partners the development of an Indo-Pacific economic framework.
This framework will define our shared objectives around:
trade facilitation, standards for the digital economy and technology, supply chain resiliency, decarbonization and clean energy, infrastructure, worker standards, and other areas of shared interest.
IPEF will not include market access commitments
such as lowering tariff barriers, as the agreement is more of an administrative arrangement.
About
Launched in Tokyo, in May 2023, IPEF aims to strengthen economic engagement among the member countries to advance growth, peace and prosperity in the region.
According to an insight paper on IPEF put out by the US Congressional Research Service, the
IPEF is not a traditional trade agreement
Rather, it would include different modules
(four pillars)
covering various aspects.
Four Pillars of IPEF
Pillar I - Fair and resilient trade,
Pillar II - Supply chain resilience,
Pillar III – Clean economy (infrastructure and decarbonization), and
Pillar IV – Fair Economy (tax and anticorruption).
Countries would have to
sign up to all of the components within a module (pillar)
but do not have to participate in all modules
Members
The IPEF has
14 partner countries
including Australia, Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the US.
Significance
The 14-nation IPEF bloc is seen as crucial as it accounts for about
40 per cent of the world’s GDP
28 per cent of the world’s trade in goods and services
It is seen as an economic and trade strategy backed by the US to counter China’s economic influence in the region.
India and IPEF
In September 2022, India joined
three pillars of the IPEF
These are the
supply chain, clean economy, and fair economy pillars of the IPEF
However, it had decided to remain out of the trade pillar. India has an
observer status on the trade pillar negotiations
Initiatives under IPEF
IPEF Upskilling Initiative
The IPEF Upskilling Initiative, launched in September 2022, aims to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by offering digital skills training, especially for women and girls in emerging and middle-income IPEF partner countries.
Over the past two years, 14 US companies and the Asia Foundation have provided 10.9 million upskilling opportunities under this initiative, with India benefiting from 4 million of these opportunities.
The initiative focuses on empowering women and girls by enhancing their digital skills for economic development.
Critical Mineral Dialogue
The ongoing dialogue within the IPEF focuses on key areas such as comprehensive mapping of mineral resources, promoting trade by tracking trade flows within the region, and fostering technical collaboration for mineral recovery and recycling.
These initiatives aim to strengthen the critical mineral supply chain and ensure sustainable mining practices across IPEF partner countries.
Tech Council
The initiative's main objectives are to coordinate and cooperate on key technologies among IPEF partners.
This will be done by sharing best practices and standards, strengthening digital infrastructure resilience, promoting investment, and fostering innovation through workforce development.
Current collaboration areas include cybersecurity, undersea cables, and artificial intelligence.
Cooperative Work Program (CWP)
CWP aims to facilitate joint efforts among IPEF countries to advance the objectives of the Clean Economy Agreement.
So far, 8 CWP proposals have been announced in IPEF Ministerial meetings.
These proposals cover areas such as hydrogen supply chains, carbon markets, clean electricity, sustainable aviation fuel, just transition, emissions intensity accounting, small modular reactors, and India's proposal on e-waste urban mining.
India signed and exchanged the first-of-its-kind agreements focused on Clean Economy, Fair Economy, and the IPEF Overarching arrangement under IPEF.
IPEF Clean Economy Agreement (Pillar-III)
The Agreement on Clean Economy aims to foster cooperation in clean energy and climate technologies to accelerate energy security, climate resilience, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction.
It promotes technical cooperation, workforce development, capacity building, and research collaborations.
The agreement will also facilitate investments, project financing, and joint projects, with a focus on supporting MSMEs and integrating Indian companies into global value chains, especially in the Indo-Pacific.
These goals will be achieved through joint initiatives such as Cooperative Work Programmes, the IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund, and the IPEF Accelerator.
IPEF Fair Economy Agreement (Pillar-IV)
The Agreement under the IPEF aims to create a more transparent and predictable trade and investment environment by enhancing anti-corruption efforts, including preventing bribery and improving tax transparency.
It focuses on boosting information sharing, facilitating asset recovery, and strengthening cross-border investigations and prosecutions.
These measures will support India's fight against corruption, money laundering, and terror financing.
The partners will also collaborate on Technical Assistance and Capacity Building (TACB) initiatives to effectively implement anti-corruption measures and improve the efficiency of tax administration.
Overarching IPEF Agreement
The Overarching Agreement under the
IPEF establishes a high-level Ministerial oversight mechanism
to guide the implementation of various IPEF agreements.
It sets general goals, providing political oversight and long-term stability to the IPEF partnership.
This agreement aims to ensure the effective implementation of subject agreements (Pillars II-IV), enhancing India’s productive capacity, supply chain integration, and innovation in line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative.

**********Pitfalls of Estimating GDP
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction
Proposed Changes in GDP Estimation (Changes, Concerns, etc.)
Way Forward & Recommendations
Introduction:
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a critical measure of a country’s economic size and is used universally to compare economic indicators, tax burdens, and welfare expenditures across countries.
GDP estimates are most meaningful at constant prices, reflecting real growth by removing the effects of inflation
The current GDP series, with the
base year of 2011-12
, is due for revision, with
2020-21 proposed as the new base year
This revision involves the use of various datasets to accurately capture changes in the economy.
Proposed Changes in GDP Estimation:
National Statistical Office (NSO) is considering using Goods and Services Tax (GST) data to estimate value addition for the next GDP revision
This data is proposed to replace the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ MCA-21 database, which is currently used for estimating the
Private Corporate Sector (PCS)
, accounting for about 38% of GDP.
This shift is intended to enhance the accuracy of GDP estimates.
Previous Changes in GDP Estimation:
The MCA-21 database was introduced in the last revision of the GDP series (2011-12 base year), replacing the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) and RBI data samples that were previously used to estimate manufacturing value-added.
The change was made because
ASI data was found to miss value addition occurring outside factory premises, and the RBI sample did not fully capture the growing PCS
The 2011-12 GDP revision led to surprising results, such as a significantly higher growth rate for the manufacturing sector compared to the earlier series.
This raised concerns, as the higher growth rates did not align with other macroeconomic indicators like bank credit growth and industrial capacity utilization, leading to skepticism about the new GDP estimates.
Systematic Overestimation of GDP:
Comparative studies between the GDP estimates based on the MCA-21 database and ASI data have shown significant discrepancies.
From 2012-13 to 2019-20, the average annual growth rate of Gross Value Added (GVA) in the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) was 6.2%, compared to just 3.2% as per ASI data.
Similarly,
Gross Fixed Capital Formation
(GFCF) growth was 4.5% in NAS but only 0.3% in ASI.
Gross fixed capital formation is a measure of how much of an economy's new value is invested in assets that are used to produce goods and services, rather than consumed.
These findings indicate a systematic overestimation in the NAS series, validating concerns about the reliability of GDP estimates based on the MCA-21 database.
Concerns About Using GST Data for GDP Estimation:
The proposed use of GST data for GDP estimation is seen as a potential game-changer due to its vast and up-to-date nature.
However, concerns remain as the
GST dataset has not been sufficiently analyzed or validated for policy research
NSO is urged to conduct pilot studies and systematic analyses to ensure the data’s suitability for GDP estimation
Without these validations, the reliability of GDP estimates using GST data could remain questionable.
Recommendations & Way Forward:
To maintain the integrity of GDP estimates, the
NSO should avoid hastily implementing unverified datasets and methods
It is crucial to initiate pilot studies to validate the GST data for specific industries, sectors, and regions.
Alternatively, the NSO could consider reverting to ASI data, which now has a shorter time lag and could provide more reliable estimates for manufacturing GDP.
Conclusion:
Accurate GDP estimation is essential for assessing economic performance and informing policy decisions.
While the incorporation of new datasets like GST holds promise, careful testing and validation are necessary to avoid the pitfalls of past revisions.
Ensuring the accuracy of GDP estimates will reinforce confidence in the economic data used by policymakers, researchers, and the public.

**********India’s Data Centre Ambitions
Why in News?
Given the sector's expansion in emerging economies, India may become a major player in the data centre market in the years to come. However, it may also face stiff competition from nations like Malaysia and Vietnam.
A data centre refers
to a designated space within a building or a set of architectural configurations designed to accommodate computer systems and their associated components, including networking and storage systems.
What’s in Today’s Article?
The Indian Data Centre Sector
Data Centres in the Emerging Markets in Asia-Pacific
Case of India
Efforts in India to Boost Computing Capacity
The Indian Data Centre Sector:
Data centre segments in India:
It is categorised into two main segments: captive and outsourced (including colocation and hosting), and further divided by IT infrastructure type, which includes servers, storage, and enterprise networking.
Market overview:
The Indian data centre market is currently in a
dynamic phase
, marked by impressive growth and substantial government support.
In 2023
, India’s data centre market achieved
revenues
of approx. US$7.44 billion, with network infrastructure emerging as the dominant segment, valued at US$5.09 billion.
In 2022, the data centre capacity in India was at 637 MW.
India is ranked the
13th largest data centre market
in the world with 138 data centres.
Additionally, 45 new data centres with a combined 13 million square feet and 1,015 MW of capacity are scheduled to be developed by the end of 2025.
Government support:
Data centre policy:
To encourage investment and accelerate India’s current rate of data centre expansion, the Indian government is formulating a data centre policy.
Salient provisions of the policy:
Incorporating data centres under the Essential Services Maintenance Act (
ESMA
), Creating Data Centre Facilitation Units (
DCFU
Creating Data Centre Economic Zones, and
Creating a special category code for data centres under the
National Building Code of India
Outlook:
India’s data centre sector is set for growth, driven by a thriving digital economy, widespread internet access, and the transition to
5G networks
from 4G.
emerging regulatory frameworks require data localisation
, which will impact demand in the data centre market.
Data Centres in the Emerging Markets in Asia-Pacific:
Highlights of a research by S&P Global:
As over $100 billion
will be invested in such facilities in the Asia-Pacific region over the next 5 years, emerging markets in the region are
expected to outpace
established markets in capacity growth.
The spending will capitalise on strong data growth and the rise in AI, cloud computing and digitalisation.
Why is emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific an attractive alternative to developed markets?
Lower costs
to develop and operate data centres;
Significant growth in data demand due to
digitalisation and favourable demographics
; and
for the building of local data centres as part of their push for data sovereignty.
Case of India:
According to the S&P Global research,
India currently has a leased
data centre capacity of 1-3 GW
, which is the highest compared to other emerging markets like Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
India is already home to data centres set up by big tech companies like
Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.
Challenges for India:
India could face competition
from both emerging markets and developed economies in attracting more data centres.
For example,
Johor Bahru in
has become a hot landing spot for new data centres. It can be a cheaper alternative to Singapore for regional data traffic, with more affordable land and power.
Japan
is offering subsidies to decentralise data-centre development, such that new centres will be built away from big cities like Tokyo and Osaka.
Opportunities for India:
Stricter data sovereignty requirements in the Southeast Asian
country
, could give India an edge.
Data centres in tier-two or tier-three cities
typically have lower land and construction costs compared with tier-one cities.
The Indian government is looking to subsidise
setting up of data centres to capitalise on the AI boom, and
make access to computing capacity easier
for smaller entities like start-ups and research institutions.
Efforts in India to Boost Computing Capacity:
Need:
Apart from data sets and inventive algorithms, one of the
most crucial components of developing a huge AI system
is computing capacity.
Due to the high cost, it is also
one of the most difficult components
for smaller businesses seeking to develop such AI systems.
Steps taken:
The Indian government is planning to
procure graphics processing units (GPUs)
as part of its ambitious
IndiaAI Mission
This will
offer computing capacity
to Indian start-ups, researchers, public sector agencies and other entities approved by the government.
IndiaAI Mission:
Under the mission (launched at the GPAI Summit 2023), the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) will look -
To establish a computing capacity
of more than 10,000 GPUs and
To help develop foundational models
trained on datasets covering major Indian languages for priority sectors like
healthcare, agriculture, and governance
Of the total outlay (of Rs 10,372 crore), Rs 4,564 crore has been earmarked for building computing infrastructure.

**********The perception of Justice
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Justice system in India;
Why in the News?
The perception of justice is as vital as justice itself, with unelected constitutional institutions expected to uphold transparency and exercise restraint in engaging with elected authorities.
Relationship between Public Perception and the Actual Functioning of the Justice System:
Role of Perception in Justice
: Perception of justice is critical because it shapes public trust in institutions. Even if the justice system functions properly, if it is perceived as biased or ineffective, it erodes confidence. The system must not only deliver justice but also be
seen as just.
Moral Authority
: When unelected constitutional bodies, like the judiciary, demonstrate
transparency and accountability,
they build moral authority.
Perception vs Reality
: Public perception can sometimes be more influential than the actual functioning of the system. Institutions like the judiciary must work to balance delivering justice and managing public perception to maintain credibility.
How Do Systemic Biases Affect Perceptions of Justice Among Marginalized Communities:
Historical and Structural Biases
: These perceptions arise when the
system disproportionately
impacts certain communities, whether through
discriminatory practices or unequal access
to legal representation.
Erosion of Trust
: When systemic biases are evident, marginalized groups may become cynical or disengaged from legal processes, believing that the system is not designed to serve their interests. This creates a widening gap between these communities and the justice system.
Impact on Public Discourse
: Systemic biases fuel narratives that the justice system is rigged or unfair. In the long term, this can lead to public apathy, where marginalized groups may stop engaging with the system, assuming that it will not provide them justice.
Broader Reflections on Democracy and Institutions:
Information and Discourse
: The explosion of media and social media has blurred the lines between personality-driven and issue-based politics. This shift has led to heightened cynicism, where the focus on individuals overshadows serious discourse on public issues.
Restoring Institutional Integrity
: For democracies to thrive, institutions must maintain boundaries defined by constitutional mandates. When constitutional organs exhibit higher standards of probity and transparency, they inspire trust, which is vital for democracy.
Responsibility of Constitutional Institutions
: Independent constitutional bodies, like the judiciary, are expected to rise above partisan politics and protect democratic values.
The example of
T.N. Seshan, former Chief Election Commissioner of India,
exemplifies how individuals can enhance institutional integrity by adhering to constitutional principles and maintaining public confidence.
Conclusion:
The functioning of the justice system, while critical, is deeply influenced by public perception, especially
among marginalized communities.
Systemic biases create barriers to justice for these communities, reinforcing negative perceptions. Constitutional organs must hold themselves to
, as public trust in these institutions is
vital for the health of democracy.

: Younger women, especially those aged
15-24
, work even longer hours. For instance, young women in IT and media work
57 hours per week
, and those in professional, scientific, and technical fields work
55 hours per week
Gender Imbalance in Workforce
: Indian women are underrepresented in these sectors. Only
8.5%
of the Indian workforce in professional, scientific, and technical jobs and
20%
in information and communication jobs are women. This low percentage is among the lowest globally.
Global Comparison
: In countries like Germany, women in similar IT and media jobs work far fewer hours
(32 hours weekly)
. Russia reports
40 hours
for the same sector, highlighting how disproportionately longer Indian women work.
Major Challenges in Indian Society:
Workload Stress
: The tragic death of Anna Sebastian highlights the
intense workload stress
that young professionals, especially women, face. High demands and long working hours can severely affect mental and physical health.
Male-Dominated Workspaces
: Women in professional fields face challenges working in
male-dominated environments
, which can result in increased pressure, lack of support, and issues of gender equity.
Systemic Gender Inequality
: Despite rising participation in the workforce, the
gender imbalance
in professional sectors reflects deeper societal and structural inequalities. Women continue to face barriers to career advancement, equal representation, and fair treatment.
Lack of Support
: The absence of adequate organizational support during personal tragedies (as indicated by Anna’s case) points to a
lack of empathy and a toxic work culture
in certain professional settings.

**********Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
MRSA, Vancomycin
Why in the News?
In 2019, MRSA caused over 100,000 deaths, and although vancomycin has been the main treatment for 40 years, a new study shows it may not stay effective for long.
About Vancomycin
Vancomycin is an
antibiotic
that has been a cornerstone in the treatment of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
infections for over
It is a
glycopeptide antibiotic
that works by inhibiting the synthesis of
bacterial cell walls

, such as those affecting the bloodstream, heart, bones, and lungs.
How Vancomycin is losing its effectiveness against MRSA?
MRSA rarely develops
resistance to
, but when it does, it leads to the emergence of
vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA)
Resistance Mechanism
: When S. aureus acquires the vanA operon, a gene cluster responsible for vancomycin resistance, it can resist the antibiotic. However, this resistance usually comes with a fitness cost—the bacteria tend to grow slower, making them less virulent.
Fitness Compensation
: Recent research shows that S. aureus can evolve to overcome this fitness cost, allowing VRSA to grow faster and remain resistant even in the absence of vancomycin. This adaptation means the bacteria are less likely to lose their resistance and can spread more easily.
Mutations
: The study found that additional mutations in the VRSA strains exposed to vancomycin helped the bacteria adapt and maintain resistance. These mutations made the bacteria more fit, ensuring they could thrive even in the presence of vancomycin.
Diminishing Options
: As VRSA continues to adapt, vancomycin may no longer be reliable for treating MRSA infections. This raises concerns about the long-term viability of the antibiotic, prompting the need for new treatment strategies.
