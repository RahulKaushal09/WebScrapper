GLOBAL GENDER GAP INDEX
Syllabus
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT, SOCIAL ISSUES
Context:
The 2024 edition of the Global Gender Gap Index places India at 129 out of the 146 countries it surveyed. This puts India at the 18th position from the bottom.
Background:-
For comparison, of the 156 countries included in 2021, India was at the 17th position from the bottom. Thus, overall, India’s ranking has remained in the bottom 20 over years.
Key Takeaways
The Global Gender Gap Index annually benchmarks the current state and evolution of gender parity across key dimensions.It is published by World Economic Forum
Like all indices, the Global Gender Gap Index, first introduced in 2006, is a précis measure. It is a combination of four different sub-indices — economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment — each summarising multiple indicators.
The index lies between 0 and 1, with 1 denoting complete parity.
It is important to note that this index focuses on gender gaps, that is, the focus is on the position of women relative to men (gender equality), rather than to their absolute position. The idea is to track changes in gender gaps both over time and across countries.
The 2024 report shows that on “Health and Survival Score”, India’s value is at 0.951 which means that 95.1 per cent of the male-female gap has been closed. Similarly, in educational attainment, 96.4 per cent of the gap has been closed.
India has done well on these indicators but since several other countries have done better, India is at 112th position in the educational ranking and at 142nd position in the health rankings among 146 countries.
On economic participation, India’s score at 39.8 per cent places it at the 142nd position among 146 countries. While this is an improvement since 2021 (when it was 32.6 per cent), it is very low in absolute terms, and is lower than the 2012 score of 46 per cent.
To put this score in perspective, countries with the lowest levels of economic parity are Bangladesh (31.1 per cent), Sudan, (33.7 per cent), Iran (34.3 per cent), Pakistan (36 per cent), India (39.8 per cent), and Morocco (40.6 per cent).
In political participation, even though India has closed only 25.1 per cent of the gap, its global rank is 65. This reflects the fact that while the rest of the world has made significant forward strides towards gender equality in the economic, educational and health spheres, the global progress on gender equality in political participation remains low. We should note that India’s position was at 51 in 2021 with a value of 27.6 per cent, implying that India’s score has worsened over the last two years.
There is ample research documenting the staggering economic costs of side lining women. An OECD estimate reveals that gender-based discrimination in social institutions could cost up to $12 trillion for the global economy, and that a reduction in gender discrimination can increase the rate of growth of GDP.
Internalisation of this understanding would mean that gender equality has to be mainstreamed into economic policy making, rather than viewed as a residual concern to be tackled later, as an afterthought.

KAVACH
The accident involving the Sealdah Kanchanjunga Express on June 17, which claimed 10 lives, has brought to the fore once again the delay in installing Kavach, an indigenously developed automatic train protection (ATP) system, across the country’s rail network.
Experts, including former Railway Minister and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, raised questions about the delay in the implementation of the system.
About KAVACH
The KAVACH is an indigenously developed Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system by the Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) in collaboration with the Indian industry.
It is a state-of-the-art electronic system with Safety Integrity Level-4 (SIL-4) standards.
It is meant to provide protection by preventing trains to pass the signal at Red (which marks danger) and avoid collision.
It activates the train’s braking system automatically if the driver fails to control the train as per speed restrictions. In addition, it prevents the collision between two locomotives equipped with functional Kavach systems.
The system also relays SoS messages during emergency situations. An added feature is the centralised live monitoring of train movements through the Network Monitor System.
‘Kavach’ is one of the cheapest, SIL-4 certified technologies where the probability of error is 1 in 10,000 years.
How does Kavach work on Railway Systems?
The Traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), with the help of equipment on board the locomotive and transmission towers at stations connected with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, helps in two-way communication between the station master and loco-pilot to convey any emergency message.
The instrument panel inside the cabin helps the loco-pilot know about the signal in advance without visual sighting, and the permissible speeds to be maintained.
If a red signal is jumped and two trains come face to face on the same line, the technology automatically takes over and applies sudden brakes.
Additionally, the hooter activates by itself when approaching a level crossing which serves as a big boon to loco-pilots during fog conditions when visibility is low.

STATE OF GLOBAL AIR REPORT
Prelims & Mains – ENVIRONMENT
Air pollution has caused 8.1 million deaths around the world in 2021 with China and India accounting for more than half of the global burden at 2.3 and 2.1 million deaths respectively, according to the recently released State of Global Air Report.
The State of Global Air report is a comprehensive analysis of the levels and trends in air quality and health for every country in the world. They are produced annually by the Health Effects Institute and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s (IHME’s) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project.
Key takeaways from the report
As per the report, air pollution is considered to be one of the biggest killers globally, second only to high blood pressure. In fact, it outranks tobacco consumption as a leading cause of death and disability, said the report.
Even though the situation is bleak globally, India is among the countries which bears the highest brunt of air pollution.
India with 2.1 million deaths and China with 2.3 million deaths due to air pollution, account for 55% of the global burden.
Not only the particulate matter, Indians are also exposed to high levels of ozone. Short-term exposure to ozone has been linked to exacerbation of asthma and other respiratory symptoms while long term exposure is linked to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  — a condition where the lungs remain inflamed obstructing the airflow.
The report states that 489,000 deaths globally were attributable to ozone exposure in 2021 — of these deaths nearly 50% or 237,000 deaths took place in the country.
India also reported the highest number of pollution-linked deaths in children under the age of five in 2021 with at least 169,400 deaths attributed to air pollution.
As per data, there has been a steady increase in the number of deaths attributable to air pollution in India, barring a small dip seen during the pandemic.
Health challenge
Air pollution poses a big public health challenge — becoming the second leading risk factor for early deaths after high blood pressure and ahead of tobacco consumption.
Unlike high blood pressure and tobacco consumption — which mainly affects adults — air pollution kills children.

ROHINGYA REFUGEES IN INDIA
Mains – GS 2 & 3
: The condition of Rohingya refugees is once again in the limelight as the world refugee day was observed
World Refugee Day is an international day designated by the United Nations to honour refugees around the globe. It falls each year on June 20 and celebrates the strength and courage of people who have been forced to flee their home country to escape conflict or persecution.
About Rohingyas:
They are a Muslim minority ethnic group with their roots in the Arakan kingdom in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.
The Rohingya are culturally and religiously distinct from the majority Buddhist population in Myanmar.
Rohingyas in India:
As per the Ministry of Home Affairs, there are more than 40,000 Rohingya in India.
Only 14,000 of them hold United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) refugee ID cards, which offers them protection from arbitrary detention.
Challenges faced by Rohingya refugees in India:
(According to the report ‘A Shadow of Refuge: Rohingya Refugees in India’ the following are the challenges faced by Rohingya refugees in India.) :
According to the report, India is not allowing exit permissions for Rohingya refugees who have completed refugee status determinations with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and gained approval from third countries for resettlement
The Rohingya refugees in India are being labelled as illegal migrants which hamper their integration into society along with risks of being deported back to Myanmar, where they fled from a genocidal regime.
The fear of deportation has instilled a sense of fear within the Rohingya community, compelling some to return to camps in Bangladesh.
Rohingyas live in dire conditions such as slum-like settlements without safe running water, toilets, or access to basic healthcare and education.

**********NEET-NET Crisis: The Reason Behind India’s Failing Exam System
Context
The NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) controversy represents a culmination of systemic failures
and poor policy implementation over the years.
This scandal, marked by recurrent paper leaks, incorrect results leading to tragic aspirant suicides
, and inexplicable awarding of grace marks,
has eroded public trust
in the National Testing Agency (NTA).
Therefore, it is
imperative to examine the roots and ramifications of these issues, offering a nuanced understanding
and proposing potential reforms.
Incidents of Recent Paper Leaks and Their Impact
Recent controversies surrounding NEET have highlighted significant flaws
in its administration.
Leaks of examination papers
and the release of incorrect results have not only led to a loss of trust but have also been
linked to tragic aspirant suicides.
In the latest instance,
an unprecedented 67 students achieved perfect scores,
raising suspicions of systemic manipulation.
Additionally, over 1,560 students received grace marks
without transparent justification, further eroding confidence in the National Testing Agency (NTA).
government’s cancellation of the National Eligibility Test (NET) due to similar issues compounds doubts
about the integrity of these examinations.
Origin of NEET Policy, its Objectives and Implementation Challenges
Standardising Educational Competence
One of the primary motivations for instituting NEET was the need to standardise the educational competence
of students entering medical colleges.
Before NEET, there was a noticeable disparity in the foundational knowledge of basic sciences
such as Chemistry, Physics, and Biology among students from different educational backgrounds.
disparity often led to significant variations in the quality of medical graduates, as students from some regions or institutions possessed insufficient understanding
of these crucial subjects.
By implementing NEET, the Ministry of Health aimed to ensure that all medical aspirants, regardless of their educational background, met a minimum standard of competence
in the basic sciences.
Reducing the Number of Entrance Examinations
India’s medical aspirants faced several entrance examinations and there were approximately 46 different entrance exams
conducted by various medical colleges and institutions, each with its own syllabus, format, and evaluation criteria.
multiplicity of exams created significant stress and confusion for students
, who had to prepare for and appear in multiple tests within a short period.
policy aimed to consolidate these numerous exams into a single, standardised test
—NEET.
move was expected to simplify the admission process
, reduce the financial and logistical burden on students, and ensure a more straightforward and equitable selection process.
By having one common entrance examination, the government hoped to streamline the process,
making it more efficient and less cumbersome for all stakeholders involved.
Eliminating Capitation Fees
Another
critical issue NEET sought to address was the rampant practice of capitation fees
in private medical colleges.
Capitation fees are essentially donations or bribes paid by students to secure admission,
often bypassing merit-based selection criteria.
This practice not only compromised the quality of medical education but also made it inaccessible to deserving students
from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
basing admissions solely on NEET scores, the policy aimed to curtail the discretion of private medical colleges
in selecting students.
This merit-based approach was intended to ensure that only the most qualified candidates gained admission,
irrespective of their financial background.
elimination of capitation fees was seen as a step towards fostering transparency and fairness in the admission process
, thereby enhancing the credibility of medical education in India.
Challenges in Implementation
While the objectives of NEET were clear and well-intentioned,
the implementation of the policy encountered several challenges.
In 2013, the Supreme Court suspended the scheme following petitions from private colleges
that argued NEET’s centralised process infringed on their autonomy.
However,
a five-judge bench restored NEET in 2016,
reaffirming the need for a unified examination system.
One of the persistent issues was the lack of a uniform standard for school education
across India.
Central government schools followed the CBSE syllabus, which was generally more rigorous than the syllabi of state boards
and the International Baccalaureate (IB) programs in private schools.
This disparity led to accusations of bias, as NEET’s standards were perceived to favour students from CBSE backgrounds.
The Opposition of NEET: The Case of Tamil Nadu
Tamil Nadu has consistently opposed NEET, advocating for its state policy of linking medical college admissions
to high school performance.
state’s Expert Committee,
led by Justice A.K. Rajan, revealed that
rural students and those from Tamil medium schools were disproportionately disadvantaged by NEET.
Between 2017 and 2021, admissions of Tamil medium students plummeted from 15% to as low as 1.6%,
and rural student admissions dropped from 62% to 50%.
This decline has significant implications for Tamil Nadu’s public health system,
which relies on rural students to work in primary health centres.
Necessary Key Reforms to Address the Crisis of NEET
Extending the MBBS Degree
One potential reform is
to extend the duration of the MBBS degree to six years, incorporating a pre-medical year.
This additional year would be dedicated to bringing students up to a standardized level in critical subjects such as Zoology, Chemistry, and Physics.
This approach has historical precedence; during the 1960s and 1970s, medical education in India included a preparatory year
to ensure all students possessed the necessary foundational knowledge.
Decentralising Examinations
critical reform is to decentralise the examination process, allowing states and universities to conduct their own entrance exams.
centralisation of NEET has led to significant disparities and dissatisfaction,
particularly among students from non-CBSE backgrounds.
State and university-level exams can be tailored to the specific educational standards and curricula of their regions, making them more relevant and fairer for local students.
Universities and states can adopt more flexible and innovative examination formats
that better assess students' knowledge and skills.
Constituting Regional Boards
intermediate solution could involve the creation of regional examination boards that standardise exams
within specific geographic areas.
These
boards could operate under the guidance of a central body
but retain the flexibility to adapt to local educational standards.
Regional boards can strike a balance between national standardisation and local relevance,
ensuring exams are fair and comprehensive.
Improving School Education
A long-term solution to the issues plaguing NEET involves fundamentally improving the quality of school education
This requires comprehensive reforms in governance, curriculum, and infrastructure.
Shifting from rote learning to inquiry-based and critical thinking-oriented education.
Curricula should be regularly updated to include the latest scientific and educational advancements.
Conclusion
current NEET crisis is representative of a broader systemic failure
in ensuring high-quality school education in India.
The long-term solution lies in improving the school system, decentralising examinations
, and establishing robust oversight mechanisms.
Only through such comprehensive efforts can confidence and credibility be restored
in the examination system, ensuring fairness and integrity for all students.

Editorial Analysis
**********Tamil Nadu hooch tragedy - Why spurious liquor can be deadly
Why in news?
In Tamil Nadu's Kallakurichi, at least 34 people have died and around 100 others are in the hospital after drinking spurious liquor, also known as hooch. It's possible that more people have died than reported, as some may have passed away before reaching medical help.
What’s in today’s article?
The Science of Creating Alcohol
Adverse effect of Ethanol on Human Health
What is Hooch/Spurious Liquor?
Regulation of Methanol in India
How can Methanol Poisoning be Treated?
The Science of Creating Alcohol:
Alcohol is produced using two basic processes:
fermentation and distillation
Fermentation
is a chemical reaction where yeast or bacteria react with the sugars (from grain, fruits, sugarcane, etc.) to produce
(the alcohol in the drink).
Liquor is differentiated by its alcohol content
from the 5% by volume (beer) to the 12% (wine) to the 40% (distilled spirits).
Distillation is important because with more of the sugar getting converted to alcohol,
the conditions become toxic
is the process of physically separating the alcohol from the rest of the mixture using evaporation and condensation.
Adverse effect of Ethanol on Human Health:
Ethanol (C2H5OH) is
metabolised in the liver and the stomach
by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes to acetaldehyde.
Then aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes transform the
into acetate.
The adverse effects of alcohol consumption, from the
hangover to cancer,
are due to acetaldehyde.
Contrary to popular belief, the
World Health Organization
(WHO) has found that “no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health”.
About
Hooch is a commonly used term for poor quality alcohol, derived from Hoochinoo, a native Alaskan tribe that was known to produce very strong liquor.
Unlike branded liquor which is produced in factories with sophisticated equipment and rigorous quality control,
hooch is made in more crude settings
(in many cases homemade) without any quality checks.
Process
Like all alcohol, hooch is produced using two basic processes: fermentation and distillation.
Hooch is produced using distillation of a fermented mixture, generally of locally available yeast, and sugar or fruit (often fruit waste).
The fermented mixture which is to be distilled contains
more than just consumable alcohol (ethanol)
It also contains
methanol
(CH3OH), a different form of alcohol which is highly toxic for human beings.
During the distillation, both ethanol (boiling point of 78.37 °C) and methanol (boiling point of 64.7 °C) are concentrated.
Thus, if done incorrectly, distillation can lead to an end product which contains high quantities of toxic methanol.
The end product can have a
high concentration of methanol
(instead of harmless trace amounts), which is poisonous and can also cause
cerebral edema (swelling of the brain), haemorrhage, and death
Importantly,
it is near impossible to tell
whether hooch is safe to consume before actual consumption.
Regulation of Methanol in India:
Schedule I of the Manufacture, Storage and Import of
Hazardous Chemical Rules 1989
includes methanol.
The Food Safety and Standards (Alcoholic Beverages) Regulations 2018
stipulate the maximum permissible quantity of methanol in different liquors.
For example,
these values span a wide range including “absent” in coconut fenny, 50 grams per 100 litres in country liquor, etc.
The Indian Standard
(IS 517) applies to how the quality of methanol is to be ascertained, and together with the Tamil Nadu Denatured Spirit, Methyl Alcohol, and Varnish (French Polish) Rules 1959, what signage, methanol packaging should carry
Once methanol is ingested, the body takes some time to completely eliminate it. There are
two immediate ways
to treat methanol poisoning.
One is to administer ethanol
(of a pharmaceutical grade, by healthcare workers). Ethanol competes with methanol for the ADH enzymes. As a result, the methanol is kept from being metabolised to formaldehyde.
The other option is to administer an antidote called fomepizole
, which slows the action of the ADH enzymes, causing the body to produce formaldehyde at a rate that the body can quickly excrete, preventing the deadlier effects from kicking in.

**********India’s law against use of unfair means in exams
Why in news?
With the recent controversies surrounding the
National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) UG-2024
and the cancellation of the
University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET)
, public examinations have come under increased scrutiny.
UGC-NET 2024 was cancelled on June 19 after the Union Home Ministry found that the integrity of the examination may have been compromised. UGC-NET is the qualifying exam for admission to PhD programs, and to apply for an entry-level teaching position at an Indian university.
This was the first time a centrally-conducted public examination has been scrapped after Parliament passed Public Examinations (Prevention Of Unfair Means) Act in February 2024.
What’s in today’s article?
Public Examinations (Prevention Of Unfair Means) Act 2024
Challenges and way forward
About
This act was passed by the Indian Parliament in February 2024. It aims to prevent unfair means in order to bring greater transparency, fairness and credibility to the public examinations system.
Wide scope of application
The Act is the first Central Government legislation addressing unfair practices in public examinations.
It has a broad scope, allowing for the inclusion of other agencies through government notifications.
Considerate of candidates’ welfare
Bona fide candidates of the public examinations are kept outside the purview of the Act.
Even the defaulting candidates will not be punished within the Act however, appropriate action will rather be taken by the concerned public examination authority.
Unfair means in an examination has been defined
Section 3 of the Act lists at least 15 actions that amount to using unfair means in public examinations for monetary or wrongful gain.
These include:
Leakage of question papers or answer keys and colluding in such leaks.
Unauthorized access to question papers or Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) response sheets.
Tampering with answer sheets, including OMR sheets.
Unauthorized persons providing solutions during exams.
Assisting candidates indirectly or directly.
Tampering with documents used for shortlisting or ranking candidates.
Tampering with computer systems or networks.
Creating fake websites.
Conducting fake exams and issuing fake admit cards or offer letters for cheating or monetary gain.
Inclusive and comprehensive
The Act comprises 19 sections across six chapters, addressing all aspects of preventing unfair means in public examinations.
It includes comprehensive definitions covering various unfair practices such as question paper leaks, assistance to candidates, security violations, and tampering with computer systems.
It also addresses details like manipulation in seating arrangements.
Punishments
Section 9 of the Act states that all offences shall be cognizable, non-bailable, and non-compoundable.
This means that an arrest can be made without a warrant and bail will not be a matter of right; rather, a magistrate will determine whether the accused is fit to be released on bail.
Public examination defined
Section 2(k) defines a public examination as any examination conducted by a public examination authority listed in the Act's Schedule or any other authority designated by the Central Government through notification.
The central government can add new authorities in the schedule through a notification as and when required.
Power to Refer Investigation to a Central Agency
The Act empowers the Central Government to refer any case under the Act to a Central Investigating Agency whenever necessary in order to ensure expeditious and cautious disposal of matters concerned.
Designation of a Public Servant
The Act designates the officials of public examination authority as public servants, thereby ensuring accountability and transparency in the process.
As a result, appropriate administrative action can be taken against the defaulting public servants, following the service rules and procedures of the authority.
Status of organized crime
Section 11 of the Act addresses organized crimes, imposing punishments ranging from 5 to 10 years and fines up to 1 crore rupees.
Criticism and way forward
Fate of public examinations cancelled due to unfair means
The Act does not specify a time frame for rescheduling exams canceled due to unfair means.
Given the high stakes for numerous candidates, timely rescheduling is crucial.
It is recommended that canceled exams be re-conducted within six months to preserve candidates' merit and preparation, ensuring fair opportunities for all.
Invigilators and Officials are unaware of examination procedures
Invigilators and administrative officers often lack proper training, leading to inefficiencies and opportunities for unfair practices.
To prevent this, eligibility criteria for invigilators should be established. Intensive training programs and workshops should be conducted to equip invigilators with necessary skills.
Investigation referred to a DSP level officer
The Act designates officers of at least Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) or Assistant Commissioner of Police rank to investigate unfair means in public examinations.
However, given the significant impact on candidates,
a specialized investigation and regulation authority should be established
for systematic investigation of these offences.
Underutilization of Modern Technology and AI
Authorities have yet to effectively use technology to counteract offenders who are increasingly using it for their schemes.
Electronic methods can streamline the question paper-setting process, reduce time, and allow for digital verification of question sets.
Centralized question banks can make managing and updating questions more efficient.
Electronic printing and distribution of exam papers can also minimize the risk of paper leaks.
Integrating technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance the evaluation stage by catching discrepancies overlooked by humans.

**********India – Bangladesh Bilateral Relationship
Why in the News?
Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is on a two-day visit to India.
What’s in Today’s Article?
India – Bangladesh Relationship (History, Trade, Development, Culture, etc.)
News Summary (Teesta Water Dispute)
India – Bangladesh Bilateral Relationship:
India and Bangladesh share bonds of history, language, culture, and multitude of other commonalities.
Historical Ties:
India's relationship with Bangladesh dates back to the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War when India provided crucial military and material assistance to help Bangladesh gain independence from Pakistan.
However, the relationship deteriorated in the mid-1970s due to boundary disputes, insurgency, and water-sharing issues, especially after military regimes took control in Bangladesh.
Stability in bilateral relations was restored when Sheikh Hasina became Prime Minister in 1996, leading to the signing of the
Ganga Water Sharing Treaty
Since then, India and Bangladesh have strengthened their cooperation in various sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, connectivity, and defense.
Economic and Commercial Ties:
Bangladesh is India's largest trade partner in South Asia, with bilateral trade reaching USD 15.9 billion in FY 2022-23.
Bangladesh exports approximately USD 2 billion to India annually.
In 2022, both countries completed a joint feasibility study on a
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
This agreement is crucial as Bangladesh will lose its Least Developed Country (LDC) status after 2026, which will impact its duty-free and quota-free access to Indian markets.
Consequently, Bangladesh aims to finalize a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India.
Power and Energy:
Bangladesh imports 1160 MW of power from India
Projects like the
Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline
are key initiatives.
India supports Bangladesh's energy sector through various partnerships.
Development Partnership:
India has extended four Lines of Credit to Bangladesh amounting to USD 8 billion for infrastructure development.
High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs) are a significant part of India’s assistance, focusing on human resource development and capacity building.
Cultural Cooperation:
Cultural exchanges are facilitated through the
Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre and Indian Cultural Centre in Dhaka
Programs in arts, dance, and language promote people-to-people contacts.
The Bangladesh Youth Delegation program attracts young talent to visit India.
PM Sheikh Hasina’s visit to India:
This will be the first incoming bilateral State visit by a foreign leader after the formation of the new government following the Lok Sabha elections.
Sheikh Hasina was among the seven leaders from India’s neighborhood who attended the swearing-in ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on June 9.
During the bilateral meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sheikh Hasina, Teesta water dispute is expected to be discussed.
Controversy on the Teesta Water Dispute:
Background:
The Teesta River originates in the Pauhunri mountain of Sikkim, flows through West Bengal, and enters Bangladesh, joining the Brahmaputra.
It is the second largest river in West Bengal after the Ganga, making it crucial for both West Bengal and Bangladesh.
Historical Context:
India and Bangladesh have been negotiating the sharing of Teesta waters since the early 1980s.
A water-sharing agreement was almost signed in 2011 during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Bangladesh. However, it was halted due to last-minute objections by West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Recent Developments:
In 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Dhaka, accompanied by Mamata Banerjee, and expressed confidence in finding a fair solution.
Despite efforts, the issue remains unresolved. In a recent interview, Prime Minister Hasina emphasized the need for India to be more accommodating to resolve the dispute.
Current Status:
Bangladesh seeks an equitable share of the Teesta waters to ensure sufficient water flow during the dry season.
India’s internal political dynamics, particularly the stance of the West Bengal government, play a significant role in the negotiations.
Importance of Teesta Waters:
The Teesta River is vital for irrigation and water supply in both countries.
Sheikh Hasina recently urged India to show greater flexibility to resolve the issue.

or the Mandal judgement, a 9-judge Constitution bench of the SC (by a 6-3 majority) ruled that the
total quota must never exceed 50%.
The apex court called this limit fair and reasonable (without giving any justification) and added that the
50% reservations rule may be deviated
from in certain extraordinary situations.
Present condition on reservation:
Reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs in legislatures, higher education and public employment
cannot exceed 50% of the total seats
However, some states (most notable is Tamil Nadu, where the reservation is 69%), the Union government and the SC itself have
occasionally breached it over the years.
SC’s observations in different cases:
Maratha reservation:
It resulted in the increasing of the total reservations in the state to 68% and was struck down by the SC in 2021 for violating the 50% ceiling established in its 1992 judgement.
Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) reservation:
A five-judge Constitution bench of the court upheld the quota last year by a 3:2 majority, stating that the 50% ceiling is flexible and it was only in the context of reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs.
Bihar had last year raised the quota for scheduled castes (SCs), scheduled tribes (STs), extremely backward classes (EBCs), and other backward classes (OBCs) in educational institutions and government jobs from 50% to 65%.
This had been
done after a caste survey
showed that these groups formed
roughly 84% of the state’s population
A clutch of petitioners challenged -
The Bihar Reservation of Vacancies in Posts and Services (for SC, STs and OBCs) Amendment Act, 2023 and
The Bihar Reservation (in Admission to Educational Institutions) Amendment Act, 2023.
The petitioner argued that there was no scientific analysis
of the caste survey data, and that the quota increase was
based solely on the lack of proportionate representation
in government jobs and educational institutions.
Arguments For and Against Reservation:
For:
The State Government had given this reservation due to a lack of adequate representation of these classes and not on a proportionate basis.
Against:
Together with the 10% EWS quota, the laws had pushed reservation in Bihar to 75%, well past the 50% ceiling set by the SC.
After the caste survey, this decision of reservation was taken on the basis of the proportion of castes, and not on the basis of adequate representation in government jobs.
The case of caste survey is currently pending for hearing in the SC.
The Verdict of the Patna HC:
It set aside the Bihar government’s laws
as ultra vires the Constitution and violative of the equality clause under Articles 14, 15, and 16.
The HC said the
enhancement of reservations beyond the 50% limit
- as set by a nine-judge bench of the SC in 1992 -
was “bad in law”
This is because it not only violates the principles of equality emanating from the Constitution, it
fails to demonstrate any extenuating circumstance that could enable it to breach the 50% norm

**********How Dangerous is Methanol Poisoning?      
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Preventive measures to avoid consumption of Spurious liquor
Why in the news?
At least 38 people have died after consuming spurious liquor in Tamil Nadu’s Kallakurichi district.
Key Points Related to the Kallakurichi District Incident in Tamil Nadu
Incident Overview:
As of 9:30 p.m. on June 20, at least 38 people died after consuming spurious liquor in Kallakurichi district and 82 others were receiving treatment in hospitals. The tragedy follows a similar incident a year ago in Chengalpattu and Villupuram districts, which resulted in over 20 deaths.
Government Response:
Chief Minister M.K. Stalin transferred the Collector and suspended the district superintendent of police. The State deployed 2,000 police personnel around the district. A one-man commission headed by former High Court judge B. Gokuldas was constituted to inquire into the tragedy.
How is Spurious Liquor Made and Why Does it Have Deadly Effects?
Composition:
Spurious liquor often contains methanol in addition to ethanol. Methanol is sometimes added to increase the intoxicating effect and/or bulk volume of the homemade liquor.
Methanol’s Deadly Effects:
Methanol is metabolized in the liver to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes. Formaldehyde is further metabolized to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes. The accumulation of formic acid leads to metabolic acidosis and acidaemia, damaging various organs and leading to potential death.
Why is Methanol added to Liquor and How is it Processed by the Body if Ingested?
Reasons for Adding Methanol:
To enhance the ‘kick’ or intoxicating effects of the liquor and increase the volume of the liquor cheaply.
Processing in the Body:
ADH enzymes convert methanol to formaldehyde.ALDH enzymes then convert formaldehyde to formic acid. The build-up of formic acid causes metabolic acidosis, optic neuropathy, cerebral oedema, hemorrhage, and potential death.
Is Treatment Effective?
Timeliness is Crucial:
Early intervention is essential for effective treatment of methanol poisoning. Prompt administration of antidotes and supportive therapies significantly improves the chances of recovery and reduces the risk of severe complications such as blindness or death.
Available Antidotes:
Ethanol and Fomepizole are effective antidotes that inhibit the metabolism of methanol to toxic compounds. Ethanol competes with methanol for ADH enzymes, while fomepizole directly inhibits these enzymes, preventing the formation of harmful formaldehyde and formic acid.
Supportive Therapies:
Hemodialysis can effectively remove methanol and its toxic metabolites from the bloodstream, while folinic acid helps break down formic acid. These treatments, when combined with antidotes, can mitigate the damage to vital organs and improve patient outcomes.
Way forward:
Strict Regulation and Monitoring:
Enhance regulatory oversight of liquor production and distribution to ensure all alcoholic beverages meet safety standards. Regular inspections and stringent enforcement of licensing laws can prevent the production and sale of illicit alcohol.
Public Awareness and Education:
Conduct widespread public education campaigns to inform the community about the dangers of consuming spurious liquor. Awareness programs can help people recognize the signs of adulterated alcohol and understand the severe health risks associated with its consumption.
Mains PYQ:
Effectiveness of the government system at various levels and people’s participation in the governance system are interdependent.” Discuss their relationship with each other in the context of India.

**********Can GM Crops promise Food Security?
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
GM crop in India
Mains level:
Are Non-GM Ecological Crops Also a Food Security Solution?
Why in the news?
A new “gene revolution” is being promoted as a solution to increasing global food demand and the impact of climate change on agriculture.
What does the World Economic Forum (WEF) say?
The WEF supports GM technology and believes it can help ensure food security for a global population expected to reach 10 billion by 2050.
Research into new strains of rice, maize, wheat, potato, and cassava can help these staples survive extreme weather and new climate-induced diseases.
Latest bioengineering technologies can help plants and soils capture and store atmospheric carbon, potentially reducing planet-heating carbon.
Projects are optimizing photosynthesis in crops like maize and rice to improve yields and reduce atmospheric carbon.
Industrial-Scale GMOs Perpetuate Climate Change
Critics argue that GM crops sustain an “agro-industrial system” responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions. Current food systems contribute to around one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions.
GMOs often involve large-scale monocultures requiring significant amounts of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation.
This system is criticized for being energy-intensive and unsustainable, benefiting large agro-industrial companies that dominate the seed, food, pesticide, and fertilizer markets.
What is the Present Scenario?
Over half of harvested cropland in the US uses genetically modified seeds.
Despite the proliferation of GM crops, food insecurity remains widespread, with 250 million people in nearly 60 countries experiencing crisis-level food insecurity.
Successful campaigns, like in the Philippines, have led to production moratoriums on certain GM crops due to health and ecological concerns.
Resistance to GMOs persists, with scepticism about their safety and ecological impact.
Non-GM ecological approaches face challenges due to limited research support, as most funding comes from large agri-biotech companies.
Ecological, non-GM crops aim to produce toxic-free food and nurture biodiverse ecosystems that can resist and mitigate climate change.
There is ongoing development of ecological, non-GM seed, food, and nutrition systems to address food security in a warming world.
Way forward:
Enhanced Regulatory Oversight and Support for Ecological Practices:
Strengthen regulations to ensure the safe development, testing, and deployment of GM crops while supporting research and development of non-GM ecological farming practices.
Public Awareness and Inclusive Research Funding:
Launch comprehensive public education campaigns to inform communities about the benefits and risks of GM and non-GM crops, promoting informed decision-making.
Note:
India has approved the commercial cultivation of
only one GM crop, Bt cotton.
No GM food crop has been approved for commercial cultivation in the country.

**********What is ‘Blood Money’ in Islamic Law?
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Principle of Diyya; Reparative Justice
Why in the News?
The
Indian Government
has approved the transfer of the sum of $40,000 for preliminary discussions regarding the
release
Nimisha Priya from a Yemeni prison
.
Currently, Priya’s mother is in Yemen, trying to waive her death penalty by paying “blood money” to the murdered man’s family.
Nimisha Priya’s Case Details
Priya, a nurse, moved to Yemen in 2008 and married Tomy Thomas in 2011 before returning to Yemen.
She faced abuse and exploitation by Talal Abdo Mahdi, leading to the tragic events resulting in Mahdi’s death and Priya’s arrest.
The $40,000 payment aims to initiate negotiations for Priya’s release.
To waive the death penalty, Priya’s family may need to raise $300,000-$400,000.
The ‘Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council’ is fundraising to meet this requirement.
What is Blood Money?
According to Islamic law,
victims of crimes
have a
say in how criminals are to be punished
In the case of murder, this principle applies to the
families of victims
Although murder is punished via the death penalty, the victim’s family (specifically, heirs) may choose to “forgive” the murderer in exchange for
monetary compensation
This is the
principle of
Diyya,
or, as it is commonly referred to “
”.
It can be traced to the
Holy Quran
Applicability:
Blood money is applicable in cases of
unintentional homicide
Qatl Khata
) or accidental death, as well as in cases of bodily injury or harm caused by negligence or unintentional actions.
Practical Implications of Blood Money
Scholars believe that the idea behind this is to encourage the
virtue of forgiveness
, while also providing
reparative justice
to the victims’ family.
The scriptures
do not set any specific amount
as compensation.
The sum is generally arrived at via
between the murderer’s family/representatives and the victim’s family.
Some Islamic countries, however, have set
minimum compensation
amounts.
Significance of Blood Money
Forgiveness
from the victim’s family is highly encouraged and considered
virtuous in Islam
Blood money aims to
prevent cycles of vengeance or retaliation
(Qisas) that could lead to further social harm or conflict.
It promotes
reconciliation
and mutual understanding.

A limbless amphibian, the
striped caecilian (Ichthyophis spp)
, has been newly identified within the 1,307.49 sq. km
Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve
Assam’s wildlife officials reported its discovery during a herpetofauna survey.
Back2Basics: Herpetofauna
Herpetofauna refers to a group of
reptiles and amphibians
collectively.
The term combines “herpeto-” from the Greek “herpeton,” meaning “creeping animal,” and “fauna,” referring to the animal species found in a particular region or time.
Herpetofauna play essential roles in ecosystems:
They act as both predators and prey, help regulate insect populations, and serve as indicators of environmental health.
They serve as environmental indicators and play significant roles in pest control.
About Striped Caecilian
The Striped Caecilian (Ichthyophis spp.) is a type of
belonging to the family
Ichthyophiidae
Caecilians are often
mistaken for snakes
or worms

They are primarily
found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas
They usually live
underground
or in moist
soil habitats
Key features of the Striped Caecilian include:
They have smooth, cylindrical bodies with a
ringed or striped pattern
, hence the name “striped.”
Caecilians are predominantly
fossorial (burrowing)
, spending most of their lives underground or in leaf litter. This behaviour makes them elusive and difficult to study.

**********Proposed Amendments to Insolvency Resolution Process by IBBI
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
IBBI, IBC
Why in the News?
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI)
has
proposed amendments
to the Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Process regulations to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and increase transparency.
This aims to align with the Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules and streamline the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP).
Do You Know?
Since its enactment, the IBBI has achieved
notable successes
in resolving insolvency cases and recovering debts:
Debt Resolution:
The IBC has successfully resolved Rs. 3.16 lakh crore of debt across 808 cases within seven years (as per CRISIL).
Higher Recovery Rates:
Creditors have realized an average of 32% of admitted claims and 169% of the liquidation value through IBC proceedings, demonstrating higher recovery rates compared to previous mechanisms.
Behavioural Change:
Companies have been proactively involved in the settlement of debts amounting to over Rs. 9 lakh crore before cases enter formal insolvency processes.
Proposed amendments by IBBI
Simplified Valuation
: Instead of separate reports for different types of assets, there will be one comprehensive valuation report covering the entire company. This helps in keeping valuation consistent and clear.
Single Valuer for Small Companies
: For smaller companies with assets up to ₹1,000 crore and MSMEs, only one valuer will be appointed to determine the company’s value unless there’s a good reason for more than one.
Option for Two Valuers
: If needed, the creditors’ committee can choose to have two valuers to deal with complex cases, but they have to explain why.
Faster Appointment of Representatives
: Representatives appointed to represent creditors can start participating in meetings as soon as their application is submitted, to avoid delays.
Guarantees in Resolution Plans
: If a resolution plan suggests releasing guarantees, it won’t stop creditors from going after guarantors or using the guarantees according to their agreements.
