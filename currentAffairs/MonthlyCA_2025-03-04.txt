Structural Changes in Earth's Inner Core

Why in News?
A study published in
Nature Geoscience
reveals that
Earth's inner core
is undergoing
structural changes
.
What are the Key Findings of the Study?
Methodology:
Researchers analyzed
seismic waves
near Antarctica’s South Sandwich Islands from 1991 to 2024. Repeating earthquakes revealed subtle changes in seismic waves, offering insights into Earth’s inner structures.
Structural Changes in Inner Core
: The
near surface of Earth's inner core
, challenging the earlier belief that
it is rigid and stable.
inner core's rotation
appears to be
slowing down
, which could subtly
alter the length of a day
on Earth.
Researchers suggest
viscous deformation in the inner core
is caused by dynamic interactions between the
turbulent, molten outer core and the solid inner core,
similar to how
magma
flows under stress.
What are the Key Facts About Earth's Inner Core?
Structure:
is a
hot, dense ball
primarily made of
iron and nickel
. Unlike the
liquid outer core
, the inner core remains
solid due to immense pressure
from Earth's upper layers.
Depth and Size:
Located
5,150 km beneath
the surface, at Earth's center. It has a
radius of about 1,220 km
The boundary between the inner and outer core is called the
Lehmann Discontinuity
Magnetism:
The inner core influences
Earth's magnetic field
, while the outer core's swirling liquid iron generates it through the
geodynamo effect
(magnetic field generation).
The inner core has
high thermal and electrical conductivity
Rotation:
The inner core rotates eastward slightly
faster than the Earth's surface,
completing an extra rotation every 1,000 years.
Growth:
The inner core grows by about
1 mm per year
as the liquid outer core solidifies.
Growth is uneven, occurring more around subduction zones and less near superplumes.
The core will never fully solidify due to slow crystallization and continuous radioactive decay.
