Transboundary Rivers of India
Source: TH
Why in News?
Bangladesh has recently faced severe
floods
, leading to concerns that the water might be coming from the
Dumbur dam in Tripura
, India.
However, the Indian government has clarified that the flooding is caused by heavy rainfall in the larger catchment areas of the
Gumti River
, which flows through both nations, rather than the dam’s water release.
What are the Transboundary Rivers of India with Neighboring Countries?
India-Bangladesh:
India and Bangladesh share
54 rivers
, with India having the most rivers flowing into the Bay of Bengal via Bangladesh.
Major rivers are:
The Ganges (Padma in Bangladesh):
This major river flows from India into Bangladesh,
traversing the Gangetic plain of North India.
Major left-bank tributaries include the
Gomti, Ghaghara, Gandak and Kosi
Major right-bank tributaries include the
Yamuna, Son, Punpun
Damodar
Ghaghara:
Originating in the Tibetan Plateau, it joins the Ganges near Patna and is notable for its high discharge, especially during the monsoon.
Son River:
Flowing through the Kaimur Range, it covers 487 miles before joining the Ganges above Patna, Bihar.
In Bangladesh, the Ganges has only one tributary, the
Mahananda,
while it has distributaries such as the Ichamati, Nabaganga, Bhairab, Kumar, Goari Madhumati, and Arial Khan.
Teesta:
It originates in the
Himalayas
and flows through Sikkim and West Bengal before
merging with the Brahmaputra in Assam and the Jamuna (called Brahamputra in India) in Bangladesh.
Bangladesh is advocating for a fair allocation of Teesta River waters from India, similar to the
Ganga Water Treaty of 1996
. However, this request has not been successful.
1996 Ganges Water Treaty
between Indian and Bangladesh aimed t
o resolve disputes between
India and Bangladesh over water flow entitlements, which
emerged after the Farakka Barrage
was built in 1975 to
divert Ganges water to the Hooghly River for maintaining Calcutta port.
Feni:
This river
flows 135 km south of Agartala,
the capital of Tripura. Out of its 1,147 square km catchment area, 535 square km is in India, with the remainder in Bangladesh.
It forms part of the India-Bangladesh border.
Maitri Setu
, a 1.9 km Long Bridge over Feni River, is constructed in
link India and Bangladesh.
Some notable tributaries of the Feni River include the
Muhuri River, Raidak River, Chandkhira River, Ryang River
Kushiyara River.
Kushiyara River:
It is a distributary of the
Barak River,
originates at the
Amlshid bifurcation point
on the
, where the Barak divides into the
Surma
rivers.
It begins in Assam and gathers tributaries from Nagaland and Manipur.
Brahmaputra River:
It originates from
Chemayungdung glacier
Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet
Mount Kailash,
flows through India and Bangladesh forming a
natural border
between the two countries.
It passes through
Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, and Meghalaya
before entering
(called as the
).
Major tributaries include the
Subansiri, Kameng, Manas, and Dhansiri
rivers in India, and the
The Brahmaputra River joins the Ganga River in Bangladesh, forming the
Padma River
, which then merges with the
Meghna River
and flows into the Bay of Bengal through the
Meghna Estuary.
Meghna:
Barak river in India divides into 2 streams
Surma and Kushiyara
in Karimganj district in Assam. Surma and Kushiyara rejoin at
Kishoreganj district in Bangladesh
to be known as Meghna.
Upto Chandpur in Bangladesh, it is known as Upper Meghna and after meeting Padma in Chandpur, it is known as Lower Meghna.
Jamuna (called Brahmaputra in India):
Jamuna is a
distributary of Brahmaputra
, separating from the mainstream at the point where
Brahmaputra meets Teesta
in Bangladesh, and flows with the name Jamuna till
Goalundo ghat in Bangladesh
where it meets
Padma river (called Ganga in India)

India-China:
The Trans-border rivers flowing from China to India fall into two main groups.
Brahmaputra River System:
Brahmaputra river system
on the eastern side, which consists of river
Siang
(main stream of river Brahmaputra) and its tributaries, namely
Lohit
, with the river Brahmaputra called Yaluzangbu or Tsangpo in China; and
Indus River System:
Indus River system
on the western side, consisting of river
and the river
Sutlej
There are two MoUs signed between India and China for provision of hydrological information on these two rivers by China to India.

India-Pakistan:
Indus River:
is a trans-boundary river in Asia that
originates in Western Tibet
, flows northwest through the Kashmir, and then continues south-by-southwest through Pakistan, eventually emptying into the Arabian Sea near Karachi.
The water of the Indus River and other west-flowing rivers from India has been a
contentious issue
between India and Pakistan since independence.
Sutlej:
It is a major tributary of the Indus River, originating at
Rakas Lake
in Pakistan.
It flows parallel to the Indus for about 400 kilometres, enters India through
Himachal Pradesh's Shipki La Pass,
and continues through Punjab.
There, it meets the
Beas River
, forming part of the
India-Pakistan border
Chenab River
The combined flow creates the
Panjnad River
, which empties into the Indus.
Chenab:
It is a major tributary of the Indus River, originating from the confluence of the
Chandra and Bhaga streams at Tandi
Known as Chandrabhaga in its upper reaches, it flows west through
Jammu and Kashmir
and then southwest into Pakistan.
It descends into the
province's alluvial lowlands and
meets the Jhelum River near Trimmu
before emptying into the
Sutlej River
Jhelum:
Originating from
Verinag Spring in the Kashmir Valley,
it travels through Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab.
It passes through Srinagar and
Wular Lake
, entering Pakistan through a
gorge
Gilgit
and merging with the
near Jhang.
Beas:
The Beas River originates at
Beas Kund near Rohtang Pass
Himachal Pradesh.
It flows through the
Kullu valley
and joins the Sutlej River at
Harike
in Punjab.
Ravi:
Ravi River originates at
Bara Bangal of Kangra district
, Himachal Pradesh, and flows through Bara Bansu, Tretha, Chanota and Ulhansa, covering 158 km before entering Punjab state.
Its famous tributaries are
Budhil, Siul, Baljeri, Chatrari and Baira
1960 Indus Waters Treaty
has allocated control of the
Beas, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers to India
Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum rivers to Pakistan.

India-Nepal:
are major rivers from Nepal that flow into India. Other significant rivers include the
Rapti, Narayani,
Kali.
These rivers, which enter India from Nepal, primarily originate in the
Himalayan ranges.
Kosi:
The Kosi River, a transboundary river flowing through
China, Nepal, and India,
tributary of the Ganges
Originating from the confluence of the
Sun Kosi, Arun Kosi, and Tamur Kosi
in the Himalayas, it flows through Nepal and Bihar before
in Bihar.
Kosi is known for its frequent course changes and flooding, earning it the nickname
"sorrow of Bihar."
Gandak:
It is  also known as the
Gandaki or Narayani River,
flows through northern India and Nepal.
Originating in Tibet near the Nepal border at an altitude of 7,620 metres.
Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
before merging with the Ganges near Patna.
Mayangadi, Bari, Trisuli, Panchand, Sarhad,
Budhi Gandak.
Sharda/Kali/Mahakali River:
It originates at
Kalapani in Uttarakhand
. It flows along the western border of
Nepal and India
After merging with the
Ghaghra River
and passing through the hills as the Kali River, it enters the Terai plains and is known as the
Sharda River.
Pancheshwar Dam
, a joint
project for irrigation and hydroelectric power, has been proposed for this river.
India and Nepal have traditionally disagreed over the interpretation of the
Sugauli Treaty 1816
, which delimited the boundary along the
Maha Kali River in Nepal
, with the two countries differing as to which stream constitutes the source of the river.
