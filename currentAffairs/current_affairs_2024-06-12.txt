SPEAKER
Syllabus
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
Context:
As the 18th Lok Sabha prepares to meet, the TDP and JD(U), key allies of the BJP in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), are said to be jockeying for the post of Speaker.
Background:-
After a pro tem or temporary Speaker administers the oath to new members, the Speaker is chosen to be the Presiding Officer of the House.
About Speakers post
The Speaker has a key role in parliamentary democracy. The Constitution of India provides for the offices of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker who, according to Article 93, are to be elected “as soon as may be” after the commencement of the House.
The Speaker is elected by a simple majority in the House. The term ends with the dissolution of the House, unless the Speaker resigns or is removed from office before that.
A motion of no-confidence can be moved against the Speaker with notice of 14 days as per Article 94 of the Constitution. Separately, the Speaker, like any other member of the House, can face disqualification.
There are no specific qualifications for becoming Speaker, which means any member is entitled to be considered. However, the post of Speaker is distinct from other members in the House.
The salary of the Speaker is drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India unlike for other MPs, which flow from a statute voted on by the House itself.
Powers of the Speaker
Conducting house: The conduct of government business is decided by the Speaker in consultation with the Leader of the House. Prior permission of the Speaker is required for members to ask a question, or to discuss any matter.
Question and Records: The Speaker decides the admissibility of a question raised by a member, as well as how the proceedings of the House are published. The Speaker has the power to expunge, in full or in part, remarks that she may consider to be unparliamentary. Critical remarks against the ruling party may not be published if the Speaker decides to expunge them.
Casting Vote: According to Article 100 of the Constitution, which talks about voting in the Houses, the Chairman of Rajya Sabha or Speaker of Lok Sabha, or any person acting as such, “shall not vote in the first instance, but shall have an exercise a casting vote in the case of any equality of votes”.
No-confidence Motion: One of the most important times when a Speaker’s impartiality impacts the Opposition is when a motion of no-confidence is moved against the government.
Disqualification of members: The Tenth Schedule or the anti-defection law, introduced to the Constitution through the Fifty-Second (Amendment) Act, 1985, gives the Speaker of the House the power to disqualify legislators who ‘defect’ from a party.
In the landmark case Kihoto Hollohan versus Zachillhu in 1992, the Supreme Court upheld the power vested in the Speaker and said that only the final order of the Speaker will be subject to judicial review.
In 2020, the Supreme Court had ruled that Speakers of Assemblies and Lok Sabha must decide disqualification pleas within three months except in extraordinary circumstances.

QUANTUM DATA
Prelims & Mains – Government schemes
A new quantum computing study claims that a recent finding in the production, storage and retrieval of “quantum data” has brought us one step closer to the quantum internet.
The study, conducted by researchers from Imperial College London, the University of Southampton, and the Universities of Stuttgart and Wurzburg in Germany, utilized a specialized photon source to achieve this feat.
About QUANTUM DATA
Quantum data refers to information stored and processed using the principles of quantum mechanics.
Unlike classical data, which is represented by binary states (0s and 1s), quantum data is represented by quantum bits or qubits.
Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to a property called superposition, and they can be entangled with other qubits, allowing for a kind of interconnectedness and correlation that classical bits cannot achieve.
Applications of Quantum Data:
Cryptography: Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to create secure communication channels that are theoretically immune to eavesdropping.
Optimization problems: Quantum algorithms can potentially solve complex optimization problems more efficiently than classical algorithms.
Simulating Quantum Systems: Quantum computers can simulate other quantum systems, which is useful for understanding chemical reactions, materials science, and fundamental physics.

INDIA MALDIVES RELATIONS
Prelims – Current Event
: The President of Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu, was one of seven leaders from India’s neighbourhood who attended Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in at Rashtrapati Bhavan on June 9.
Muizzu’s presence was significant, given the way he has positioned himself politically vis à vis India, and the crucial strategic aspect to the India-Maldives relationship.
About INDIA MALDIVES RELATIONS
Muizzu came to power on November 17 last year on an ‘India Out’ plank.
The India Out campaign had begun in 2020 as the Maldives opposition’s protest against then President Ibrahim Solih’s policies that were perceived to be friendly towards New Delhi, but had soon turned into a movement against India’s alleged military presence in the archipelago, which both the Solih government and India denied.
Muizzu demanded the withdrawal of all Indian military personnel from Maldives. Consequently, the final batch of Indian soldiers — who were stationed in the Maldives to operate and maintain two helicopters and three Dornier aircraft India had previously gifted to the country were replaced by civilians in May.
Like his mentor, former President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom, under whose rule (2013-18) the India-Maldives relationship deteriorated severely, Muizzu has openly aligned his country with China, India’s geopolitical rival in the Indian Ocean.
The Chinese influence in the Maldives has increased steadily over the past couple of decades.
The island nation is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which has led to an influx of Chinese money and a strengthening of the relationship between the two countries — at the expense of India.
For India, the Maldives is a crucial ally, important to secure its maritime periphery and to keep an eye on the larger Indian Ocean region where China is making aggressive moves.
Regardless of Muizzu’s pro-China, anti-India posturing, the Maldives cannot simply “let go” of India. It is heavily dependent on Indian imports in almost all important sectors, from food to life-saving medicines, and aircraft used in search and rescue missions.
At a time when relations between India and the Maldives are at a low, Muizzu’s visit sends an encouraging signal. Some groundwork for a reset in the relationship has been done over the past couple of months.
In April, India approved the highest-ever export quotas for essential commodities — eggs, potatoes, onions, sugar, rice, wheat flour and pulses, river sand and stone aggregates — to Maldives for 2024-25 under a unique bilateral mechanism that has been in effect since 1981.
Significance of Maldives for India:
Maldives’ proximity to the west coast of India, and its location at the hub of commercial sea lanes running through the Indian Ocean imbues it with significant strategic importance to India. The security scenario in India’s periphery in the Indian Ocean is very much linked to the maritime strength of Maldives.

UNIFIED PAYMENTS INTERFACE (UPI)
Mains – GS 3
: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced new rules and regulations to enhance the scope of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payments.
The Unified Payments Interface (UPI), used for immediate money transfers through mobile devices, has become the fastest-growing payment mode in the country. Since its launch, the volume of digital transactions in India has increased exponentially.
Unified Payments Interface (UPI):
It was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016 and built over Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) infrastructure.
It powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features e.g., transfer of funds, etc.
It is designed to enable peer-to-peer inter-bank transfers through a single two-click factor authentication process.
Features of Unified Payments Interface (UPI):
It simplifies transfers using the recipient’s UPI ID, be it a mobile number, QR code, or Virtual Payment Address, eliminating account numbers.
Earlier, only the deposited amount could be transacted through the UPI System. But now using the credit line on UPI enables pre-sanctioned credit lines from banks via UPI.
It eliminates the need to enter bank details or other sensitive information each time a customer initiates a transaction.
It enhances cross-operability, enabling 24/7 transactions.
It uses technologies like the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and the Aadhaar-Enabled Payment System (AEPS) to ensure that payments between accounts go smoothly.
The users can both send and receive money offline through any compatible device that supports Near Field Communication (NFC) using UPI Lite X.
It facilitates push (pay) and pull (receive) transactions and even works for over-the-counter or barcode payments, as well as for multiple recurring payments such as utility bills, school fees, and other subscriptions.
UPI Tap and Pay allows NFC-enabled QR codes at merchants to complete payments, with a single tap without entering the PIN.
Concerns/Issues/Challenges associated with UPI:
Expanding UPI to accommodate a global user base will require adhering to data protection, financial laws, and regulations of different countries posing regulatory and compliance challenges.
The recent Parliamentary panel’s report, titled ‘Digital Payment and Online Security Measures for Data Protection’ recently highlights that foreign entities like PhonePe and Google Pay dominate the Indian fintech sector. For example, the market share of PhonePe is 46.91% and Google Pay is 36.39% in terms of the transaction volume in October-November 2023, whereas for BHIM UPI it is 0.22%.
UPI faces various threats by cybercriminals who may exploit vulnerabilities in the system or use social engineering techniques to gain access to sensitive information leading to financial losses.
UPI poses a significant challenge for cross-border transactions that includes managing currency conversion and exchange rates while facilitating payments and loading money into the wallet.
UPI remains a barrier to its widespread adoption especially among individuals with a lack of familiarity with digital payments, leading to financial fraud.

Steps taken by India to promote Quantum S&T
The Government of India announced a
National Quantum Mission
in April 2023 at a cost of Rs 6,000 crore, to be implemented from 2023 to 2031 by the Department of Science & Technology (DST).
It will have four verticals:
quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum sensing and metrology, and quantum materials and devices
UN has a specific process for declaring an international year. These steps include:
Proposal Submission
A member state, a group of member states, or a UN agency typically initiates the process by submitting a proposal for an international year.
It does so through a relevant agency.
For example,
India proposed 2023 as the International Year of Millets through the FAO
The proposal includes the theme, objectives, and relevance of the proposed international year.
Review and Endorsement
The proposal is reviewed by relevant UN bodies, such as the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) or other specialized agencies.
They assess the proposal's feasibility, potential impact, and alignment with the UN's goals and priorities.
Consultation and Support
The proposal undergoes consultation with other member states, relevant UN agencies, and stakeholders to gather support and refine the proposal.
Broad consensus and support from member states are crucial for the proposal to move forward.
Drafting a Resolution
Once there is sufficient support, a draft resolution is prepared.
This resolution outlines the rationale, objectives, and activities associated with the proposed international year.
Adoption by the General Assembly
The draft resolution is submitted to the UN General Assembly for consideration.
The General Assembly debates the proposal and, if there is broad support, adopts the resolution declaring the international year.
The resolution is adopted if it receives the requisite majority vote in the General Assembly plenary session.
The exact majority required can depend on the specific rules governing the session, but typically a simple majority is sufficient
Implementation
After the declaration, the UN, in collaboration with member states and relevant agencies, develops and implements a plan of action.
This includes organizing events, campaigns, and activities to promote the theme and achieve the objectives of the international year.
Monitoring and Reporting
Throughout the international year, UN monitors the progress of activities and initiatives.
At the end of the year, a report is usually prepared to evaluate the outcomes and impact of the international year.
2025 be International Year of Quantum Science and Tech
Proposal by Mexico:
The current proclamation is the result of a resolution led by Mexico in May 2023 and which was soon joined by other countries.
Proposal through relevant agency:
By November 2023, almost 60 countries had co-sponsored the resolution and the UNESCO General Conference adopted it.
Draft resolution in UNGA:
In May 2024, Ghana submitted a draft resolution to the U.N. General Assembly asking for an official proclamation, with the support of over 70 other countries.
The General Assembly acceded on June 7.
2025 marks the centenary of German physicist Werner Heisenberg's landmark paper

**********National Litigation Policy
Why in News?
With an aim to reduce the burden of pending court cases in which the government is a party, the Union Ministry of Law and Justice approved the National Litigation Policy, which will now be sent to the Cabinet for approval.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background of the National Litigation Policy
About the National Litigation Policy
Significance of the National Litigation Policy
Background of the National Litigation Policy:
As of now,
roughly 50 million
legal cases are pending at various levels of the judiciary across the country and the government is the country’s leading litigator.
For example,
the government is responsible for 73% of all cases admitted by the Supreme Court.
The
was launched in
2010
to make the government a more “
responsible litigant
”. However, the policy was
not implemented
In 2015,
the NDA government revived the plan and in a reply to Lok Sabha the then-Law minister (in 2021) said the policy was under consideration.
The long-pending policy had been a part of the BJP’s 2024 Lok Sabha election manifesto, and as his first action after taking charge of the office, the policy was approved by the Union Law Minister recently
About the National Litigation Policy:
It is based on the recognition that
the government and its various agencies are the predominant litigants in courts and tribunals
in the country.
Its aim is to
transform the government into an efficient and responsible litigant
Efficient litigant means:
A litigant who -
Is represented by competent and sensitive legal persons.
Focus on the core issues involved in the litigation and address them squarely.
Manage and conduct litigation in a cohesive, coordinated and time-bound manner.
Ensure that good cases are won and bad cases are not unnecessarily pursued.
Responsible litigant means:
That false pleas and technical points will not be taken and shall be discouraged.
Ensuring that the correct facts and all relevant documents will be placed before the court.
That nothing will be concealed from the court and there will be no attempt to mislead any court or Tribunal.
Prioritisation in litigation
has to be achieved with particular emphasis on welfare legislation, social reform, weaker sections.
The policy suggests that the pending cases with the government as party to be
reviewed on priority basis
to enable quick disposal.
It also proposed a
monitoring and review mechanism
to sensitise government in important cases and avoid delay and neglect of the same.
Significance of the National Litigation Policy:
The purpose underlying this policy is
to reduce Government litigation in courts
so that valuable court time would be spent in resolving other pending cases.
This will help the judiciary to achieve the goal in the National Mission for Justice Delivery & Legal Reforms
to reduce average pendency time from 15 years to 3 years.
The policy recognises the fact that it is the responsibility of the government -
To protect the rights of citizens, to respect fundamental rights and
Those in charge of the conduct of government litigation should never forget this basic principle.

**********Nominate sufficient number of IPS officers for deputation
Why in news?
The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has sent a letter to 24 States, stating that not enough Indian Police Service (IPS) officers have been nominated by the State governments for central deputation. This has caused many vacancies in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs).
The letter was sent to all States, except Himachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, and the eight Union Territories.
What’s in today’s article?
Shortage of IPS officers
Deputation Of All India Services – Existing rule, Proposed changes
In 2009, there were over 1,600 vacancies against a sanctioned strength of over 4,000 IPS officers.
Since then, government has increased the size of IPS batches
As on January 1, 2020, there were 908 vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 4,982.
The situation has arisen due to the government’s decision to reduce the size of new IPS batches as part of its cost-cutting measures.
From 80-90 new officers, the IPS batches were cut to 35-40 officers.
On the other hand, an average of about 85 IPS officers retire every year.
As on June 3, 2024, there were 129 vacancies at Superintendent of Police (SP) level, 81 vacancies for Deputy Inspector General (DIG), and 25 vacancies at the Inspector General (IG) level.
Deputation of All India Service (AIS) Officers
The process of Central deputation is guided by the
rule 6 (deputation of cadre officers) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules 1954
Normally, the Centre asks every year for an “offer list” of officers of the All-India Services willing to go on central deputation.
Once the Centre gets the list, it selects officers from that list.
Officers can go for Central deputation only after getting a no-objection clearance from the State government.
States have to depute the All-India Services (AIS) officers, to the Central government offices and at any point, it cannot be more than 40% of the total cadre strength.
Deputation of IPS officers
Officers are assessed if they are suitable for central deputation by the
Central Police Establishment Board (CPEB)
headed by the Union Home Secretary.
The names of officers up to the Inspector General of Police level are then sent to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), headed by the Prime Minister, for approval.
Amendment to the IPS tenure policy in February 2022
IPS officers are recruited by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on behalf of the Centre, and their services are placed under various State cadres.
In February 2022, the MHA amended the IPS tenure policy, doing away with the
mandatory requirement of empanelment
of IPS officers at the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) level by CPEB.
It said that officers with minimum 14-years of experience will be eligible for appointment at the level of DIG by the Centre.
Proposed Changes
January 2022 Proposal
In January 2022, Centre proposed to amend the Rule 6 of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules 1954.
Under the proposed amendment, the Central Government will acquire for itself overriding powers to transfer IAS and IPS officers through Central deputation.
Under the proposed amendment the officer shall stand relieved from cadre from the date as may be specified by the Central government if:
the State government delays posting a State cadre officer to the Centre and
does not give effect to the Central government’s decision within the specified time.
Also, the Centre will decide the actual number of officers to be deputed to the Central government in consultation with the State.
States should make eligible the names of such officers.
In case of any disagreement between the Centre and the State, the matter shall be decided by the Central government.
The State shall give effect to the decision of the Centre.
April 2022 proposal
In April 2022, MHA sent a proposal to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to address the shortage of officers at the SP and DIG levels at the Centre.
As per this proposal, an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer will have to come on Central deputation at the Superintendent of Police (SP) or Deputy Inspector General (DIG) level.
Otherwise,
he/she may be barred from Central posting for the rest of his/ her career.
Rationale behind April 2022 proposal
The existing rules state that if an IPS officer does not spend three years on Central deputation till the Inspector General (IG) level, he/she will not be empanelled for central deputation.
Due to the existing rules,
most IPS officers come on central deputation only at the IG level
, leading to severe shortage at the SP and DIG levels.
There are over 50 per cent vacancies at both these levels in the different Central Armed Police Forces and Central Police Organisations.
Hence, this proposal is seen as an attempt to address the shortage of officers at the SP and DIG levels at the Centre.

**********Visa Norms for Chinese Nationals
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Role of Chinese Machinery and Technicians (Domestic Industry’s Dependency, Visa Norms, etc.)
Background:
Two Union ministries, Electronics and Information Technology, and Commerce and Industry, are advocating for relaxed visa regulations for Chinese technicians.
This is due to the rising concerns from the domestic industry about unfulfilled export orders due to visa delays for Chinese technicians.
The problem was highlighted in several forums, including the
Board of Trade
(BOT) meeting in January.
The BOT advises the Commerce and Industry Ministry, with annual meetings attended by central and state government officials, major trade and industry bodies, Export Promotion Councils, and industry associations.
The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) have reportedly communicated their requests to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
Although the
domestic industry has imported and installed Chinese machinery, it cannot operationalize the plants due to visa issues
This issue arose after the Galwan clash in 2020.
Since then, efforts to send Indian professionals to China have been ineffective, as
Chinese authorities quickly approve visas for importers but delay those for Indian manufacturers and government officials
Domestic Industry’s Dependency on Chinese Machinery:
The productivity of Chinese professionals is of high quality. They can help produce 150 items with the same resources that currently produce 100.
The Chinese technicians usually stay in India only for a year, share the expertise and then return and this is in the interest of our manufacturing.
The domestic industry relies on Chinese professionals because of its significant dependence on China for crucial components in most electrical and electronic segments.
Official data indicates that
out of the nearly $100 billion worth of imports from China, around 60% comprised engineering and electronic items
, which are essential for fulfilling India’s export orders.
However, due the strained geopolitical relationship with China, India has implemented strict quality norms to reduce Chinese imports of mass consumption items and intermediate products.
Simultaneously, India is promoting domestic manufacturing through the Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) in strategic areas.
How Visa Norms Are Different for Chinese Nationals?
India allows foreign nationals to enter for business activities under ‘
Employment
’ and ‘
Business
’ visa categories.
Employment visas are granted for one year at a time
to skilled professionals, while
business visas are valid for five years
for those setting up ventures in India.
for Chinese nationals, only single-entry tourist and business visas valid for up to three months are issued, with other visa types requiring prior clearance
Additionally, employment visas are not granted for jobs that qualified Indians can perform.
Industry sources noted that while the government permits limited entry of Chinese professionals under Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes,
many manufacturers are forced to relocate operations to countries like Bangladesh, where there are no such restrictions
FDI Restrictions on China:
Following the Galwan clash in 2020, the Indian government implemented measures to reduce Chinese influence on its economy.
A significant change was made to the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, which
mandated that investments from countries sharing land borders with India be approved through the government route
Official data shows that,
since the modification in April 2020, India had approved only about a quarter of the 435 FDI applications from China by June of the previous year
Despite this, China's contribution to India's total FDI equity inflows is minimal.
From April 2000 to December 2021, China ranked 20th, with a mere 0.43% share, amounting to $2.45 billion, of the total FDI equity inflow into India.
Domestic Industry’s Request to the Union Government:
Industry representatives have indicated that visa approval delays are negatively impacting the manufacturing sector, including the leather industry, which is increasingly shifting to sports footwear.
Industry members have requested MeitY and the Commerce Ministry to allow Chinese professionals only for specific companies importing their products.
The industry acknowledges the government’s concerns. Hence, it wants
short-term visas for the Chinese technicians to help the commissioning of the plant and is willing to take safeguards as per regulations

Mains level:
Grounds of Arrest
Why in the news?
In May 2024, the Supreme Court clearly stated its stance in two important rulings that affect the rights of individuals accused of crimes.
About Supreme Court’s Decision on Detention:
Custody Not Necessary Before Charge Sheet:
The Supreme Court ruled that the custody of an accused is not mandatory before filing a charge sheet in certain criminal cases.
Relief for Investigating Agencies:
This decision, if adhered to by lower courts, could alleviate pressures on investigating agencies.
Filing of Charge Sheet:
Siddharth v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another (2021)
Non-obligatory Arrest:
Section 170 of the CrPC does not require investigating officers (IOs) to arrest every accused at the time of filing the charge sheet.
Acceptance of Charge Sheet:
Courts cannot refuse to accept charge sheets solely because the accused is not in custody if the accused has been cooperating and is unlikely to abscond.
Practical Issues:
Despite the ruling, IOs face challenges in filing charge sheets due to court practices and logistical constraints, such as the absence of all accused or arbitrary limits on the number of charge sheets accepted daily.
Grounds of Arrest:
1.  Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India and Others (2023):
Written Notification Required:
Grounds of arrest must be provided in writing to the accused to comply with constitutional and statutory mandates, specifically under Section 19(1) of the PMLA.
2. Prabir Purkayastha v. State (NCT of Delhi):
Application to UAPA:
The requirement for written grounds of arrest under PMLA applies equally under UAPA.
Formal vs. Personal Grounds:
Differentiates between formal reasons for arrest and personal grounds, necessitating detailed written reasons for arrest.
3. Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC):
Section 50(1) Compliance:
Requires that every police officer inform the arrested person of the full particulars of the offence and grounds of arrest.
Arrest Memo:
While arrest memos detail charges and are signed by the IO and the accused, there is no legal requirement to provide a copy to the accused.
Recommendation for Amendment:
To comply with constitutional rights, it is suggested to amend the law to provide a copy of the arrest memo to the accused, enhancing transparency and legal support.
Conclusion:
The Supreme Court’s decisions regarding the necessity of detention before charge sheet filing and the requirements for informing an accused of the grounds of arrest, highlight the implications for legal and procedural practices in India.
Mains PYQ:
Human right activists constantly highlight the fact that the Armed forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) is a draconian act leading to cases of human right abuses by security forces. What sections of AFSPA are opposed by the activists. Critically evaluate the requirement with reference to the view held by Apex Court.

**********Expert Explains: What European Parliament election results signify, with the rise of right-wing parties
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impacts of election result
Why in the news?
The outcomes of the June 6-9 European Parliament elections, where approximately 51% of over 370 million eligible voters across 27 EU nations participated, indicated an increase in support for right-wing and far-right parties, resulting in losses for predominantly left-leaning and liberal parties.
What is the European Parliament?
The European Parliament is one of the core institutions of the European Union (EU), where Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by citizens of the 27 member states.
It provides democratic legitimacy to EU activities and consists of 720 seats allocated based on degressive proportionality, meaning smaller states elect more MEPs than their populations would warrant.
Functions of the European Parliament:
The Parliament has three main functions: adopting and amending EU legislation along with the Council of the EU, supervising the functioning of other EU institutions (especially the European Commission), and sharing authority over the EU budget with the Council.
It also ratifies international agreements and plays a crucial role in shaping the EU’s direction on various issues such as climate change, migration, and international relations.
Major Players in the New European Parliament:
MEPs are affiliated with Europe-wide political groups based on commonalities in ideology. Major groups include the European People’s Party (EPP), Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), Renew Europe, Greens/European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA), European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), Identity and Democracy (ID), and the Left Group (GUE/NGL).
The EPP and S&D have traditionally been the two major groups, but the Parliament has become more fragmented over time, leading to issue-based coalitions.
In the latest elections, the EPP emerged as the largest group, but right-wing and far-right parties made significant gains.
Impact on EU’s Position on Hot-Button Issues like Immigration:
The European Parliament reflects broader political trends across Europe, with right-wing parties gaining traction from issues such as increased immigration, national identity, and scepticism towards certain EU policies.
This shift towards the Right has pressured many centre-right parties to adopt harder positions on immigration, likely leading to increased support for tighter border controls and stricter immigration and asylum rules.
Impacts of election result:
The election results may influence the EU’s direction on key issues like climate change, migration, and international relations.
The rise of right-wing and far-right parties could lead to shifts in policy priorities and a more conservative stance on certain issues.
In national politics, the results may impact the stability of governments and the position of leaders like Emmanuel Macron, who called for snap polls in response to his party’s poor performance in the European elections.
Conclusion:
The European Parliament election results signal a rise in right-wing parties, impacting EU policies on immigration and other key issues. National politics may also face repercussions, affecting leadership stability.

Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Quantum Theory and related Researches, National Quantum Mission (NQM)
Why in the News?
United Nations has designated 2025
as the ‘International Year of Quantum Science and Technology’
to increase public awareness
about the significance of quantum science and its applications.
This initiative,
led by Mexico
supported by nearly 60 countries
, aims to promote activities at all levels to highlight the importance of quantum science and technology worldwide.
International Year of Quantum S&T
Growing Relevance:
Quantum science and technologies, especially quantum computing, have gained prominence in public discourse due to their potential transformative impact on various fields.
Anniversary of Heisenberg’s Work:
The proclamation coincides with the upcoming centenary of Werner Heisenberg’s groundbreaking paper on quantum mechanics, published in 1925.
Support from International Bodies:
The proclamation has received endorsements from various international organisations, including the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.
What does one mean by Quantum?
“Quantum” refers to the smallest discrete unit of any physical quantity involved in an interaction according to quantum theory.
In classical physics, many properties, such as energy and momentum, are thought to be continuous and infinitely divisible.
However, in quantum mechanics, certain properties, like energy levels and the behaviour of particles, are quantised, meaning they can only exist in specific discrete amounts or levels.
What is Quantum Theory?
Quantum theory is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.
Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, and angular momentum.
Development in Quantum Theory So Far
Planck’s assumption:
In 1900, Planck made the assumption that energy was made of individual units or quanta.
Albert Einstein’s theory
: In 1905, Albert Einstein theorized that not just the energy, but the radiation itself was quantized in the same manner.
Louis de Broglie theory:
In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that there is no fundamental difference in the makeup and behaviour of energy and matter; on the atomic and subatomic level either may behave as if made of either particles or waves. This theory became known as the principle of wave-particle duality: elementary particles of both energy and matter behave, depending on the conditions, like either particles or waves
wave-particle duality).
Heisenberg proposed:
In 1927, Werner Heisenberg proposed that precise, simultaneous measurement of two complementary values – such as the position and momentum of a subatomic particle – is impossible. Contrary to the principles of classical physics, their simultaneous measurement is inescapably flawed; the more precisely one value is measured, the more flawed will be the measurement of the other value. This theory became known as the
uncertainty principle
, which prompted Albert Einstein’s famous comment, “God does not play dice.”
What is Entanglement?
Entanglement was another of several weird properties exhibited by these tiny particles.
Two particles, having ‘interacted’ with each other at some stage, were found to have got ‘entangled’ in a way that the behaviour of one produced an instantaneous reaction in the othe
even if the two were no longer connected in any way and were separated by very large distances.
The entanglement property opened up new technological possibilities first time that it was possible to ‘teleport’ the quantum states of a particle to another location without the particle moving anywhere and without a medium.
What is Superposition?
It’s a phenomenon where, a particle exists simultaneously at multiple locations, known as superposition.
The chance of finding the particle at any given place was dictated by probabilistic calculations, and once it was found, or observed, at one location, it ceased to exist at all other places.
What is Quantum Computing?
Quantum computing is a new and super powerful way of doing computer stuff.
Instead of using regular computer bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers use special bits called qubits that can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, thanks to a thing called “quantum superposition.”
This allows them to do lots of calculations all at once, making them really fast at solving certain types of problems.

**********Portable Optical Atomic Clock for accurate timekeeping at Sea
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Optical Atomic Clock and Classical Atomic Clock; Difference between them.
Why in the News?
Atomic clocks power GPS systems
, guiding us in navigation, emergencies, and military operations.
Scientists are developing optical atomic clocks to enhance timekeeping accuracy for Navies.
What are Atomic Clocks?
Atomic clocks are accurate timekeeping devices that
use the vibrations of atoms
as a precise measure of time.
They rely on the natural oscillations of atoms, usually
Caesium
Rubidium
atoms, which are extremely stable and predictable.
This stability allows atomic clocks to keep time with extraordinary accuracy,
often losing or gaining less than a second over millions of years
However they are big, need a lot of power, and are expensive, so they’re mostly used in big research places.
Working Principle:
Use of Stable Atoms:
Atomic clocks use stable atoms like Cs-133 to keep time really accurate.
Atom Energy Levels:
Atoms have energy levels like steps on a ladder, and they move between these levels when they’re excited.
Creating Resonance:
Cesium atomic clocks make caesium atoms vibrate by using
microwave radiation
at a certain frequency.
Defining Time:
One second is how long it takes for caesium atoms to vibrate a certain number of times, which sets the standard for time.
Accuracy Control:
Atomic clocks keep themselves accurate by constantly adjusting to make sure they’re vibrating at the right rate.
Portable Optical Atomic Clocks for Maritime Use
New portable optical atomic clocks for ships are more accurate and durable, making them suitable for use at sea.
These clocks are the best at sea, which is a big deal for keeping time on ships.
How Optical Atomic Clocks Are Different?
Use of Laser:
Optical atomic clocks are even more accurate because
they use lasers
instead of microwaves.
Operating Frequency:
They work at
higher frequencies
, which means they can measure smaller time intervals more precisely.
Narrow Linewidths:
Optical atomic clocks are really stable because they have a
narrow range of frequencies
, which helps them stay accurate.
Testing and Applications of Portable Optical Atomic Clocks
Initial Testing:
Scientists tested the new clocks and found they were really stable and accurate, which is a big deal for keeping time.
Comparative Performance:
These new clocks worked better than old ones, showing they could change how we keep time.
Sea Trials:
Tests at sea showed the clocks worked well even on a moving ship, proving they could be used for navigation and other important tasks.
Do you know?
Three rubidium atomic clocks and six hydrogen maser clocks onboard the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) had failed.
The failed satellite, IRNSS-1A, is still being used for messaging activities, and the data from other operational satellites will be used to maintain the system’s functionality.
