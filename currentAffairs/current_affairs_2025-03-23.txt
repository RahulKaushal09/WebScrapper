Astronauts' Recovery Process After Space Missions
Why in news?
Recently, a SpaceX capsule carrying astronauts Sunita Williams, Barry Wilmore, Aleksandr Gorbunov, and Nick Hague safely splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico after their mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS).
Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore completed a nine-month stay on the ISS, having arrived in June last year via Boeing’s Starliner capsule.
NASA, which employs Mr. Hague, Ms. Williams, and Mr. Wilmore, has a structured regimen to help them re-adapt to Earth's gravity, while Mr. Gorbunov follows recovery protocols set by Russia’s Roscosmos.

Effects of Extended Spaceflight on the Human Body
Monitoring of Astronauts in Space
Post-Flight Rehabilitation Process
Importance of Physical Rehabilitation
Microgravity impacts the human body in several ways, including fluid shifts towards the brain, muscle weakening, and reduced bone density.
To counteract these effects, astronauts follow strict exercise and diet routines while aboard the ISS.
Managing Psychological and Physiological Stress
Space agencies, including NASA, implement programs to help astronauts cope with stress caused by workload and confinement in space.
These measures ensure their mental and physical well-being during long missions.
Challenges in Spaceflight Research
Despite increasing space missions, data on the long-term effects of space travel remains limited due to the small number of astronauts, individual biological variations, and differing mission conditions.
There are also indications of gender-based physiological differences in response to spaceflight, though conclusive evidence is still lacking.
In 2024, NASA’s Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer introduced updated medical protocols outlining the tests and checkups astronauts must undergo before, during, and after space missions.
These guidelines also specify post-mission treatments based on mission duration.
Monitoring During Long-Duration Missions
Astronauts on missions longer than 30 days must conduct self-evaluations at regular intervals (two weeks, three months, six months, and nine months after launch) and submit reports to the crew medical officer.
Daily private medical conferences are held for the first week, followed by weekly check-ins and additional assessments before and after spacewalks.
Health Assessments and Medical Tests
Regular Checkups
: Hearing and ocular tests every three months; body mass measured monthly.
Blood and Urine Tests
: Conducted six months after launch or as needed.
Blood Flow & Circulation Monitoring
: Screening for deep-vein thrombosis and anomalies at one and two months after launch, as well as 42 days before return.
Radiation & Strength Monitoring
: Astronauts are assessed for radiation exposure and muscle strength throughout their mission.
After splashing down on March 19, astronauts begin a structured rehabilitation program involving medical tests and physical activities to aid recovery from microgravity effects.
Individualized Recovery Plans
NASA tailors post-flight reconditioning for each astronaut.
While most regain their pre-flight fitness within 45 days, some may require extended rehabilitation based on their recovery pace.
Medical Assessments Upon Return
Immediate Tests (Day of Return):
Physical exam, neurological assessment, ECG (resting and ambulatory), eye tests, skin checks, and blood and urine analysis.
Astronauts are also tested for orthostatic tolerance (symptoms triggered by standing).
Follow-up Examinations:
Additional physical exams are conducted three days, one to two weeks, and two months post-return.
Further tests are performed as clinically required.
Psychological and Long-Term Monitoring
A mission psychologist may conduct psychological evaluations to assess mental well-being, ensuring astronauts adapt smoothly to life on Earth.
Physical therapy helps astronauts readjust to Earth's gravity safely, preventing injuries and aiding muscle and bone recovery after prolonged spaceflight.
Initial Recovery and Assessments
Day of Return:
Crew surgeon, flight surgeon, and physiotherapist evaluate the need for massage therapy.
First Week:
Two-hour daily reconditioning with elliptical, rowing, cycling, gait training, and stretching exercises.
Progressive Rehabilitation
Second Week:
Introduction of jogging and water-based ball games to enhance mobility and coordination.
Daily Monitoring:
Medical and physiotherapeutic teams track progress, adjusting the program as needed.
Key Focus Areas
NASA’s reconditioning program targets aerobic capacity, muscular strength, stamina, bone density, balance, agility, coordination, and neuro-vestibular function.
Completion of Rehabilitation
Once astronauts regain pre-flight fitness, they are cleared to resume normal duties.

**********India’s Push for Global Ban on Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) and the Challenges Ahead
Why in news?
Amid discussions at the Raisina Dialogue, the Indian government reiterated its demand for a ban on the separatist Khalistani group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) in the U.S. and New Zealand.
Meanwhile, SFJ plans to hold a "referendum" in Los Angeles on March 23, 2025, seeking support from the Sikh diaspora for its secessionist agenda.
What’s in today’s article?
India’s Push for SFJ Ban Gains Momentum
Implications of a Ban on SFJ
Reasons Behind Non-Compliance by Other Countries
During talks with New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, PM Modi raised concerns over "illegal activities by anti-India elements," particularly the pro-Khalistan group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ).
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh echoed the demand in a conversation with U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, urging the U.S. to designate SFJ as a terror organization.
SFJ’s Referendums and Their Legitimacy
Since 2021, SFJ has been organizing "referendums" in Western democracies with large Indian diaspora populations, exploiting their strong free speech laws.
The legitimacy of these votes is questionable due to unverifiable voter identities.
Another such referendum is scheduled for March 23, 2025, in Los Angeles.
Challenges in Securing a Ban
Despite India's repeated requests, no country has agreed to ban SFJ.
New Zealand's PM emphasized his country’s commitment to free speech, while the U.S. and Canada remain cautious, especially since their investigations in 2023 implicated Indian agents in plots targeting Khalistan activists.
India’s Strategic Perspective
India believes that banning SFJ would not only curb its influence but also strengthen its position in ongoing diplomatic disputes related to alleged assassination plots.
The government continues to push for international action to counter the group's separatist agenda.
If any country from the “Five Eyes” intelligence network (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) bans SFJ, others are likely to follow due to their shared intelligence framework.
Legal Consequences in Different Countries
United States:
The Secretary of State can designate SFJ as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), leading to asset freezes, travel restrictions, and prosecution of key figures like SFJ founder G.S. Pannun.
United Kingdom:
The Home Secretary can outlaw SFJ under the Terrorism Act.
Canada:
SFJ can be listed under the Anti-Terrorism Act, enforcing strict legal actions.
Potential UNSC and FATF Actions
A successful ban in any of these countries could pave the way for SFJ’s designation under
UN Security Council Resolution 1373
This would further compel member states to take legal action against the group in accordance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regulations.
SFJ’s Activities: Incendiary but Not Illegal
Despite India’s concerns, many Western countries consider SFJ’s actions provocative but within legal bounds.
Strategic partners like the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand allow the group to operate freely, frustrating India.
Perception of G.S. Pannun
Foreign governments often view him as a non-serious figure, despite his incendiary speeches, threats against Indian institutions, and allegations of human rights violations against India.
India’s Security Concerns and Historical Parallels
India warns that ignoring SFJ could lead to serious consequences, citing Canada’s apathy in the 1980s.
This allowed extremists to carry out the 1985 Air India Kanishka bombing, killing 329 people.
SFJ glorifies individuals like Talwinder Singh Parmar, the mastermind behind the Kanishka bombing, and others involved in terrorism.
India’s Legal Actions Against SFJ
Since 2018, India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) and state police have registered 122 cases against SFJ, leading to 105 arrests.
The government renewed SFJ’s ban under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), citing links to violence, sabotage, and alleged ties with Pakistan’s ISI to incite Indian Army soldiers.

**********Challenges in Uploading Voting Data: A Closer Look at Form 17C and Electoral Transparency
Why in the News?
In May 2024, during the Lok Sabha elections, the Supreme Court heard a petition asking the Election Commission of India to publish booth-wise voter turnout data from Form 17C on its website within 48 hours of voting.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
About Form 17C (Content, Opposition’s Demands, ECI’s Stand, Way Forward)
Background:
During the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the
Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)
filed a petition in the Supreme Court demanding that the
Election Commission of India (ECI)
Form 17C (Part 1)
data—containing booth-wise voter turnout—on its website within
48 hours of polling
Despite rising public demand for transparency, the EC refused, stating it is
legally required to share this data only with polling agents
, not the public.
However, following backlash over
discrepancies in voter turnout data
, the new Chief Election Commissioner,
Gyanesh Kumar
, has indicated a willingness to meet with petitioners, suggesting possible policy re-evaluation.
Understanding Form 17C:
Form 17C is a
two-part document
mandated under the
Conduct of Election Rules, 1961
, and must be filled at
every polling station
With over
10.5 lakh polling stations
in 2024, the volume of data involved is immense.
Part 1: Account of Votes Recorded
Filled by the
presiding officer
, this form includes:
Booth’s EVM identification number
Total electors assigned
Total votes cast via EVM
Number of tendered ballots and paper seals used
Discrepancies, if any
Each copy is signed by polling agents and sealed before being sent to the
returning officer
Part 2: Result of Counting
Filled on
counting day
, it lists:
Candidate-wise vote counts
Whether these counts match with votes recorded in Part 1
Signatures from the returning officer, supervisor, and candidate representatives
Demand of Activists and Opposition Parties:
Opposition leaders and election transparency advocates want Form 17C’s Part 1 published promptly online to:
Ensure booth-level transparency
Cross-verify final vote counts with recorded turnout
Prevent post-poll manipulation or errors
Increase public trust in EVM-based elections
ADR’s July 2024 analysis revealed that
only five Lok Sabha constituencies
had matching votes polled and counted. In the other
538 constituencies
362 had 5.5 lakh fewer votes counted than polled
176 had 35,000 more votes counted than polled
Even though these figures represent a small fraction of 64.64 crore votes, ADR argues that “every vote matters”, regardless of the winning margin.
EC’s Stand:
Legal Position
The EC maintains that it is not legally obligated to publish Form 17C online. It is only required to share it with polling agents present at the booth.
Fear of Data Misuse
The EC warns that online publication could lead to morphing of images, misinformation, and public chaos, especially on social media platforms.
Exclusion of Postal Ballots
Form 17C does not include postal ballots, which could add further confusion if published without context.
Logistical Hurdles
Experts highlight practical difficulties:
Around 1 crore polling personnel are involved, many under high pressure and lacking advanced training.
Mistakes during data entry are common due to stressful conditions.
Post-election, data must be verified by election observers using video footage and documentation, leading to delays.
It remains unclear if “corrected” forms are re-validated by polling agents.
Way Forward:
To strengthen voter confidence, electoral transparency advocates suggest:
Digitising and publishing Form 17C
data post-verification
Enabling
public access
with safeguards against manipulation
Clarifying the
legal scope
of the EC’s obligations
Enhancing
training and tech support
for polling personnel
Creating a
centralised, tamper-proof database
for all booth-level data
A digital reform of election documentation like Form 17C can help bridge the gap between
transparency and practicality
in India’s democratic process.

**********Parliamentary Panel Recommends Increased Fertilizer Subsidy and Domestic Production
Why in News?
The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilizers has recommended that the Union Fertilizers Ministry seek additional funds to ensure the smooth implementation of fertilizer subsidy schemes for farmers.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Key Recommendations of the Committee
Government Initiatives in Fertilizer Subsidy and Soil Health Management
Impact of Long-term Chemical Fertilizer Use and Recommendations
Conclusion
Key Recommendations of the Committee:
Need for additional budget allocation:
The Committee urged the Ministry to request additional funds at the revised estimate stage
to prevent adverse impacts on farmers.
The projected outlay for the Department of Fertilizers in 2025-26 was
₹1,84,704.63 crore
, but the Ministry of Finance
reduced it by 7.38%
to ₹1,71,082.44 crore.
The cut has
affected
both the Nutrient-Based Subsidy (
NBS
) Scheme and the
Urea Subsidy Scheme.
Expansion of nano fertilizer production:
The Committee recommended expanding the production capacity of
Nano Urea and Nano DAP
(Diammonium Phosphate).
Timely establishment of production units
was emphasized to ensure availability.
Popularization of these nano fertilizers among farmers was suggested, citing their
role in enhancing crop yield.
For example,
field trials showed that Nano Urea led to a yield increase, with the highest impact on peas (6.14%–14.82%) and the lowest on sugarcane (1.65%–4%).
Self-sufficiency in fertilizer supply:
While India has agreements for importing fertilizers and raw materials, the Committee noted a
lack of efforts to secure mining leases
for domestic exploration and production.
It urged the Centre to
enter into mining lease agreements
for better self-reliance.
Investment from Government, Public, and Private sectors is essential to achieving self-sufficiency.
Addressing underutilisation of funds:
The Committee pointed out underutilisation of funds in
2024-25
across various categories:
20% under indigenous Phosphorus & Potassium (
PK
) fertilizers.
12% under imported PK fertilizers.
14.76% under indigenous Urea.
59.57% under Market Development Assistance (
MDA
It recommended full utilization of allocations for
effective implementation of schemes.
Continuation of the Urea Subsidy Scheme:
Given the
critical role of urea in food grain production
, the panel stressed the need to continue the Urea Subsidy Scheme.
It also highlighted that Nano DAP could reduce the dependence on conventional granular DAP through
seed treatment and foliar application.
Government Initiatives in Fertilizer Subsidy and Soil Health Management:
NBS Scheme:
Implemented on April 1,
2010
, for Phosphatic & Potassic (P&K) fertilizers.
Under NBS,
a fixed subsidy is provided based on nutrient content
, including Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP).
P&K fertilizers are decontrolled
, allowing companies to fix Market Retail Price (MRP) under government monitoring.
Urea is provided at
a statutorily notified MRP of ₹242 per 45 kg bag
(excluding neem coating and taxes). MRP unchanged since March 1, 2018.
The difference
between market price and cost is
covered by the government as a subsidy
Special Package for DAP (2024-25):
Due to geopolitical factors affecting procurement
, the Government approved a one-time special package for DAP.
Additional subsidy
of ₹3,500 per MT was granted for April 1, 2024 – March 31, 2025, beyond NBS rates.
Ensures sustainable DAP availability at affordable prices.
Impact of Long-term Chemical Fertilizer Use and Recommendations:
ICAR study:
No harmful effects
on soil fertility
if used judiciously and in balanced proportions.
Imbalanced use leads to:
Nutrient deficiencies and declining soil health.
Continuous nitrogenous fertilizer (urea) use causing
crop yield decline
NPK fertilization still results in
secondary and micronutrient deficiencies
over time.
Drip irrigation (fertigation)
improves water and nutrient efficiency, reducing fertilizer usage.
Soil health management recommendations (ICAR):
Soil test-based
integrated nutrient management
is advised.
Balanced use of:
Inorganic fertilizers (NPK).
Organic sources (manure, bio-fertilizers).
Training and awareness programs conducted for farmers.
Promotion of organic fertilizers under GOBARdhan initiative:
Market Development Assistance (MDA) of ₹1,500/MT for organic fertilizers.
Covers manure production under GOBARdhan initiative, linked with:
SATAT scheme
(MoPNG) for biogas.
Waste-to-Energy program
(MNRE).
Swachh Bharat Mission (Rural).
₹1,451.84 crore allocated (2023-26), including ₹360 crore for research.
Conclusion:
The Committee’s recommendations aim to ensure
self-sufficiency, subsidy continuity, and better agricultural productivity
through advanced fertilizers like Nano Urea and Nano DAP.
The Government's initiatives
in fertilizer subsidy and soil health management aim to ensure affordable fertilizer availability, reduce dependency on imports, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.
Balanced fertilizer use, organic alternatives, and efficient irrigation methods are key to maintaining soil fertility and food security.
