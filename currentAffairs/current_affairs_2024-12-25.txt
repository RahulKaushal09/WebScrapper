**********How Regenerative Farming Can Safeguard Our Soil
Context
India, with a staggering population of 145 crore, has made significant strides in achieving self-reliance in food and nutrition
over the past seven decades.
These accomplishments have
primarily been driven by the expansion of agricultural lands and the intensification of practices during the Green Revolution.
Current agricultural systems may fall short of meeting this goal
due to their unsustainable practices and mounting ecological costs.
Challenges of Current Agricultural Practices
Soil Degradation
The overuse of chemical fertilisers has caused
significant depletion of soil health.
Over
six decades of reliance on synthetic inputs have reduced the soil organic carbon content from a healthy 2.4% in 1947 to a critically low 0.4% today.
This degradation not only undermines the soil's ability to support crops but also jeopardizes its role in carbon sequestration, further exacerbating climate change.
Soil with organic carbon below the threshold of 1.5% loses its arability,
making it unsuitable for sustainable farming.
Economic Costs
The financial burden of soil degradation is staggering.
Over 70 years, the loss of soil organic carbon alone has cost India ₹47.7 lakh crore ($564 billion),
translating to an annual loss of ₹68,243 crore ($8.06 billion).
Additionally,
the Indian government spends ₹2 lakh crore ($25 billion) annually on subsidies for synthetic fertilisers.
These subsidies
, while intended to support farmers,
inadvertently encourage excessive and inefficient use of chemical inputs
, further degrading the soil.
Declining Fertiliser Efficiency
response ratio of fertilisers has seen a sharp decline
over the decades. In the
1960s, every kilogram of NPK fertiliser produced 12.1 kilograms of grain.
By
2010-2017, this had dropped to just 5.1 kilograms,
signalling diminishing returns on fertiliser use.
decline is a direct consequence of deteriorating soil health,
making it increasingly difficult to achieve high yields.
Environmental Impact
The environmental costs of India’s current agricultural practices are profound.
use of synthetic fertilisers contributes to approximately 25 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually
, costing the country an additional ₹14,813 crore ($1.75 billion).
emissions exacerbate global warming and
threaten the long-term sustainability of agriculture.
Furthermore,
intensive farming practices deplete natural resources
such as groundwater and reduce biodiversity, compounding the ecological crisis.
Food Security Risk
If the current trends persist,
India could face food shortages as early as 2035.
This risk is driven by a combination of factors: the growing population, increased food demand, declining soil productivity,
and the adverse impacts of climate change.
Without immediate intervention to address these issues,
India’s ability to feed its citizens will be severely compromised.
Social and Health Costs
Beyond the economic and environmental impacts,
intensive agriculture poses significant social and health challenges.
widespread use of chemical inputs has led to contamination of water and food supplies,
adversely affecting public health.
the heavy financial reliance on synthetic inputs traps farmers in a cycle of debt, contributing to rural distress and social inequities.
Necessary Steps to Address these Challenges
A Shift Towards Sustainable Agriculture
To address these challenges,
India must transition to a climate-resilient, nature-based agricultural model.
Such a system prioritises ecological intensification over traditional intensification,
reducing dependence on synthetic inputs while enhancing soil health, biodiversity, and overall productivity.
Regenerative farming, rooted in the principles of agroecology, emerges as a promising alternative.
approach reduces input costs, conserves natural resources, and boosts farm productivity
, while also promoting the well-being of farmers and consumers alike.
Mainstreaming Regenerative Practices
Prime Minister’s National Mission on Natural Farming serves as a critical step
toward safeguarding Indian agriculture.
By mainstreaming regenerative practices,
India can ensure food, nutritional, and ecological security.
Studies have demonstrated that community-managed natural farming not only improves agricultural output
but also builds social capital, enhances the health of farming communities, and fosters environmental sustainability.
The Need for Evidence and Policy Reform
For India to fully embrace regenerative farming,
intensive and longitudinal research is necessary across all 15 agro-climatic zones.
Such studies will provide scientific evidence of the benefits of regenerative practices,
helping to create awareness and inform policy frameworks.
Disseminating this evidence will also strengthen political will
, creating the development of large-scale models for adopting sustainable agriculture.
Agroecological principles must guide this transformation
and these include biological pest control, nutrient cycling, soil health enhancement, and biodiversity conservation.
A knowledge-intensive approach, supported by participatory and decentralised pedagogies, will empower farmers
to implement these practices effectively.
Way Forward
A Radical Transformation in Agriculture
India’s vision of achieving net zero status by 2070 aligns with the goals of redesigning its agricultural systems.
By focusing on regenerative farming and ecological intensification, India can mitigate the risks of climate change
, reduce hidden costs of agriculture, and ensure long-term food security.
A radical transformation of the agricultural paradigm
, underpinned by robust evidence and policy support,
is essential to secure the nation's nutritional and ecological future
Building a Scientific and Policy Framework
Redesigning Indian agriculture requires a comprehensive strategy
grounded in scientific evidence and participatory approaches.
Intensive field research across India’s 15 agro-climatic zones is essential
to validate the benefits of regenerative farming and generate localised solutions.
Public dissemination of this evidence can foster awareness, political will, and policy support
for scaling up sustainable practices.
Moreover,
knowledge-intensive systems supported by decentralised pedagogies can empower farmers
with the skills and resources to adopt agroecological principles.
Conclusion
India stands at a crossroads in its agricultural journey and the current model of intensive agriculture is unsustainable and poses significant risks
to food security, ecological balance, and economic stability.
radical shift towards regenerative and ecological farming is the need of the hour
because regenerative farming holds the key to balancing productivity with environmental stewardship.
By embracing this transformation, India can ensure its agricultural system remains resilient, productive, and sustainable, securing a healthier and more prosperous future
for its people and the planet.

**********What is Quantum Computing?
A study by IBM highlights a growing interest in quantum computing in India, driven by active participation from students, developers, and academic institutions.
About Quantum computing:
It is a cutting-edge technology leveraging the principles of
quantum mechanics
to solve problems too complex for traditional computers.
Quantum mechanics is a
branch of physics dealing with the behavior of particles such as
atoms
electrons
photons
at molecular and sub-molecular levels.
introduces phenomena like
superposition
entanglement
, enabling quantum computing's revolutionary capabilities.
Quantum computers can solve problems that are
impossible or time-prohibitive
for classical systems, such as cryptographic algorithms, simulations, and optimization tasks.
Key Features:
Fundamentally Different from Classical Computing:
Quantum computers use
quantum bits (qubits)
, which can exist in states
0, 1, or both
simultaneously (superposition). Classical computers process information in
binary bits
(0 or 1).
Superposition
enables qubits to hold multiple states at once, allowing quantum computers to perform exponentially more calculations compared to classical systems.
Example: Like a spinning coin, a qubit can represent both heads and tails until measured.
Entanglement
is a phenomenon where qubits remain intrinsically linked, regardless of distance.
Changing the state of one qubit instantly affects its entangled counterpart, enhancing computational speed.
Milestones in Quantum Computing:
Origin
: Proposed in
1982
by Richard Feynman to simulate quantum systems, as classical computers struggled with such complexity.
Breakthrough algorithms:
Shor’s Algorithm (1994)
: Revolutionized cryptography by factoring large numbers exponentially faster than classical methods.
Technological advancements
IBM Q System One (2019)
: The first circuit-based commercial quantum computer.
Google Sycamore Processor (2019)
: Demonstrated
quantum supremacy
by solving a task in 200 seconds, which would take classical supercomputers 10,000 years.
Google Willow Quantum Chip (2023)
: Introduced scalable error-corrected qubits, finishing calculations in minutes that would otherwise take billions of years for classical systems.

Recently, the US President-elect Donald Trump has once again expressed interest in buying Greenland.
About
Greenland:
It the world’s largest (non-continent) island, located between the continents of
North America and Europe in the North Atlantic Ocean.
It is geographically considered a part of the North American continent.
It is surrounded by the
Arctic Ocean to the north
; by the Greenland Sea to the east; by the North Atlantic Ocean to the southeast;
Davis Strait

**********What are Archaea?
Study of archaea a domain of ancient organisms has given scientists clues to survival strategies of micro-organisms by adapting to harsh conditions with the help of their toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems.
About
Archaea:
Archaea, which means
"ancient things" in Greek
, are one of the oldest forms of life on Earth and belong to a group called the third domain of life.
Archaea (singular archaeon) are a
primitive group of microorganisms.
They were originally discovered and described in
extreme environments
, such as hydrothermal vents and terrestrial hot springs. They were also found in a diverse range of
highly saline, acidic, and anaerobic environments.
These slow-growing organisms are also
present in the human gut (about 1–2% of the microorganisms in the human gut)
, and have a potential relationship with human health.
They are known for producing antimicrobial molecules, and for anti-oxidant activity with applications in eco-friendly waste-water treatment.
Archaea are extremely difficult to culture due to challenges in providing natural conditions in a laboratory setting.
Key points of the research:
Researchers studied a specific TA system in a heat-loving archaeon called
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius
to understand how it helps these organisms.
acidocaldarius, which lives in hot volcanic pools like
Barren Island in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands
in India and some other volcanic areas in the world, that can get as hot as 90 degrees Celsius, the research highlights its unique challenges and how it survives.
The detailed analysis of the
VapBC4 TA system
that helps
survival in the high temperature environment
, shows its important role during heat stress.
It is revealed that several functions of the VapC4 toxin, such as stopping protein production, helping the organism form resilient cells, and influencing biofilm creation.
When the cell faces heat stress, a stress-activated protease may break down VapB4 protein. Once VapB4 is gone, the VapC4 toxin is released and
can stop protein production.
This block in protein production is part of a survival strategy that helps cells form "persister cells" during stress.
These persister
cells go into resting state,
conserving energy and avoiding making damaged proteins. This dormancy helps them survive tough conditions until the environment improves.

**********India's Push for Self-Reliance in IT Hardware Manufacturing
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction
Import Measures (Policy Measures, WTO Commitments, Challenges, Import Dependency, etc.)
Way Forward
Introduction:
India's heavy reliance on imported IT hardware, such as laptops and PCs, has driven the government to explore strategies to boost domestic manufacturing.
This includes linking import permissions to domestic capacity expansion and introducing a credit system for imports once production meets critical thresholds.
Strategic Policy Measures:
Import Restrictions Tied to Domestic Manufacturing
The government plans to emulate the successful strategy used in the tyre manufacturing sector.
In 2020, restrictions on new pneumatic tyre imports led to global players like Bridgestone, Michelin, and Goodyear investing over ₹1,100 crore in local facilities.
A similar conditional easing of import norms is being considered for laptops and PCs, tied to commitments for domestic production.
Credit System for Imports
A credit system for IT hardware imports may be introduced, with detailed policies expected as domestic production gains momentum.
WTO Commitments and Global Trade Concerns:
WTO Constraints
India cannot impose higher duties on IT products, as they are bound by zero-duty commitments under the WTO’s
Information Technology Agreement
(1997).
Global Pressure
China dominates the global IT hardware market, with an
81% share of PCs and laptops and exports worth $163 billion in 2022
Leading US-based companies like Apple, Dell, and HP, which produce in China, have raised concerns about India’s import monitoring system.
Japan and China have also formally expressed opposition to India’s laptop import licensing measures.
India's Security Goals
While trade partners fear trade restrictions, the Indian government emphasizes that its policies aim to achieve self-reliance for national security, not impose undue barriers.
India’s Import Dependency:
In FY24, India imported electronic components worth $34.4 billion, making it the fifth-largest imported commodity.
Imports from
China ($12 billion)
Hong Kong ($6 billion)
accounted for over 50% of total electronic imports.
Over the last five years, imports from China and Hong Kong have far exceeded those from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and ASEAN nations combined.
Domestic Production Challenges:
Slow Progress in IT Hardware Manufacturing
Despite initiatives like the revamped
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme
(2023), domestic production of laptops and tablets has yet to scale up significantly.
27 companies
, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Foxconn, have been approved under PLI 2.0 but are still in the early stages of production.
Extended Import Authorizations
Import restrictions under the
Import Management System (IMS)
have been extended until December 31, 2025, to prevent shortages and price hikes.
Way Forward:
To reduce import dependency and achieve self-reliance, the government is pursuing a multi-faceted approach:
Strengthening Local Manufacturing
Accelerating PLI incentives and enforcing policies that link imports with domestic capacity expansion.
Diversifying Trade
Exploring alternative supply chains to reduce dependence on China and Hong Kong.
Encouraging Investments
Creating a favourable ecosystem for both domestic and foreign players to invest in manufacturing facilities.
Balancing Global Commitments and Domestic Needs
Aligning policies with WTO obligations while protecting strategic interests.

What is the Case Background?
Supreme Court's Order
Implications for ED Investigations
Broader Concerns
Conclusion
Background:
The origin of the Directorate can be traced back to
1956
, when an ‘Enforcement Unit’ was formed, in the Department of Economic Affairs, for handling Exchange Control Laws violations under Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947.
In 1957,
this Unit was renamed as ‘Enforcement Directorate’ and the administrative control of the Directorate was transferred from Department of Economic Affairs to Department of Revenue in 1960.
About:
ED is
a specialised financial investigation
agency under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, which enforces the following laws:
Foreign Exchange Management Act,1999 (FEMA)
- A Civil Law.
Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA)
- A Criminal Law.
The ED (Headquartered at New Delhi) is governed under the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) Act, 2003.
Composition:
It is composed of officers
from the Indian Revenue Service, the Indian Police Service and the Indian Administrative Service, as well as officers promoted from its own cadre.
It is headed by the
Director of Enforcement
, who is appointed by the Central government and has been provided security of
two-year tenure
in office by the CVC Act, 2003.
The ED's operation:
In November, ED conducted searches at 22 locations across six states based on a complaint by Meghalaya Police.
Allegations were made against Future Gaming and Hotel Services Pvt Ltd for
illegally monopolising the lottery business in Meghalaya.
The raids uncovered ₹12.41 crore in cash.
Future Gaming’s political contributions:
The company was the
largest purchaser of electoral bonds
, totaling ₹1,368 crore between 2019 and 2024.
Donations were made across party lines:
Trinamool Congress: ₹542 crore

**********1924 Belgaum Session
Why in news?
The Congress is organizing a two-day event in Belagavi (previously Belgaum), Karnataka, on December 26-27 to mark the centenary of
Mahatma Gandhi presiding over its historic Belgaum session in 1924
.
The event includes an extended session of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) and a rally.
What’s in today’s article?
1924 session
Backdrop against which 1924 Belgaum Session was held
After his release from prison in February 1924, Mahatma Gandhi was troubled by the lack of Hindu-Muslim unity in the freedom struggle and Congress factionalism.
Mahatma Gandhi was in prison in February 1924 for his involvement in the Non-Cooperation Movement against British rule.
He was arrested in 1922 on charges of sedition for writing three articles in Young India that criticized British policies.
Gandhi was sentenced to six years in prison but was released early in February 1924 after serving about two years due to health concerns.
To address these issues, he undertook a 21-day fast from September 18 to October 8 that year.
Participants in the 1924 Congress session
The session was attended by several senior Congress leaders including Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Sarojini Naidu, and Khilafat movement leaders Muhammad Ali Jauhar and Shaukat Ali, among others.
Significance of 1924 Session
Mahatma Gandhi presided over the 1924 Congress session in the erstwhile Bombay state,
marking the only time he held the position of Congress president
During this session, Gandhi presented his ideas on non-violence, communal harmony, and "swaraj" (self-rule).
He served as the Congress president from December 1924 to April 1925.
Gandhi’s message to the 1924 conclave
Gandhi on Non-Violence and Non-Cooperation Movement
Mahatma Gandhi discussed his philosophy of non-violence.
He explained that although the Non-Cooperation Movement was called off in 1922 after the
Chauri Chaura incident
it had been an effective strategy for India’s path to independence
He highlighted that the boycotts, such as those of government institutions and foreign cloth, were not fully successful but had reduced the prestige of these institutions.
Gandhi emphasized that non-violence, rather than revolutionary violence, was a more effective force for change, as it came from goodwill and gentleness
Hindu-Muslim Unity and Untouchability
Gandhi stressed that the removal of untouchability was as essential for swaraj (self-rule) as Hindu-Muslim unity.
He argued that Hindus could not claim swaraj until they restored the liberty of the suppressed classes,
underscoring the importance of social reform in the freedom struggle
Self-Rule and Reforms
Gandhi suggested reforms to achieve swaraj, including
moving the final court of appeals from London to Delhi and adopting Hindustani as the official language
in provincial governments and courts.
He urged the people to become "perfect satyagrahis," emphasizing that satyagraha (non-violent resistance) was an attainable quality for all, vital for achieving truth and justice.
Khadi and Self-Reliance
Gandhi called on the masses to take up spinning and weaving khadi, asserting that true swaraj could only be achieved when the people embraced self-reliance, symbolized by the use of khadi fabric.
Impact of 1924 session on the freedom movement
Historians believe that the session was a step towards the promotion of peasant consciousness.
This resulted in the spread of khadi with village industries getting traction in Karnataka and other parts of the country.
It also saw increased participation of peasants in the Congress-led initiatives.

**********A beginner’s guide to quantum computing
Context:
Quantum computing, rooted in quantum mechanics, promises to solve complex problems beyond the reach of classical computers. Proposed by Richard Feynman in 1982 to simulate quantum systems, it emerged as a solution to classical computers' limitations.
Since then, progress includes the development of qubits (using superposition and entanglement), improved error correction, and scalable hardware, paving the way for applications in cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery.
What’s in today’s article?
Significant Milestones in Quantum Computing
Present Limitations of Quantum Computing
National Quantum Mission: India’s Commitment (2023)
The Road Ahead
Classical Computing: Bits as Units of Information
Classical computers operate based on principles of classical physics.
The basic unit of information is the bit, which can be either 0 or 1.
All types of information can be represented using combinations of 0s and 1s in the binary system.
Quantum Computing: Qubits as Fundamental Units
Quantum computers rely on quantum bits, or qubits, for computations.
Qubits can represent 0, 1, or a state that is partly 0 and partly 1 simultaneously.
This
ability to exist in multiple states is unique to qubits and enables quantum computations
Key Principles
Superposition: A Key Quantum Principle
Qubits can exist in a state of superposition, holding both 0 and 1 at the same time.
Example: A spinning coin that represents both heads and tails simultaneously until it collapses to one state when observed.
Superposition allows quantum computers to perform multiple computations at once.
Entanglement: Quantum Correlation
Qubits can be entangled, meaning their states are intrinsically linked, even if they are far apart.
Measuring one qubit instantly provides information about the other, regardless of distance.
Example: If a pair of gloves are kept in separate boxes, opening one reveals the other’s state instantly.
Entanglement enables faster information processing through shared states.
Advantages of Quantum Principles
Superposition allows quantum computers to process exponentially more data than classical computers.
Entanglement facilitates simultaneous information sharing, speeding up computations.
These principles, rooted in quantum mechanics, unlock the immense potential of quantum computing, beyond the scope of classical physics.
Quantum Computers vs. Classical Computers
Quantum computers are technologically advanced but may not always outperform classical computers in every task.
Specific tasks have been developed to demonstrate the unique capabilities of quantum computing.
Shor’s Algorithm: Revolutionizing Factorization (1994)
Created by Peter Shor, this algorithm can factorize large numbers in moments, compared to millions of years required by classical computers.
Major implications for data security, as it can quickly solve problems like large-number factorization, which are used to secure encrypted data.
IBM’s Q System One: The First Commercial Quantum Computer (2019)
IBM introduced Q System One, the world’s first circuit-based commercial quantum computer.
Circuit-based designs with quantum gates are versatile and suited for general quantum-computing applications.
Google's Sycamore Processor: Achieving Quantum Supremacy (2019)
Google’s 53-qubit Sycamore processor solved a problem in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer 10,000 years.
This milestone marked quantum supremacy, where quantum computers outperform classical counterparts for specific tasks.
Google’s Willow Quantum Chip: Scaling with Error Correction (2024)
Google unveiled Willow, the first quantum processor with error-corrected qubits that improve as they scale.
Quantum error correction is critical to maintaining quantum states long enough for meaningful calculations.
Willow completed a standard test in 5 minutes, a task that would take the best supercomputers 10 trillion trillion years.
Progress and Potential
These milestones illustrate the rapid advancement of quantum computing, showcasing its potential to solve complex problems far beyond the reach of classical systems.
High Cost and Complexity
Building quantum computers is extremely expensive and technically complex.
Maintaining the stability of qubits is challenging due to high error rates and issues like decoherence caused by environmental noise.
Need for Larger-Scale Quantum Systems
Current quantum computers have limited qubits, but solving major problems (e.g., drug discovery, astronomical research) requires millions of qubits.
Scaling quantum systems to such levels remains a significant hurdle.
Recognizing the potential of quantum computing, India launched the National Quantum Mission.
The government allocated ₹6,000 crore over eight years to advance quantum technology and develop quantum computers.
While the challenges are substantial, the advancements and investments highlight the clear potential and promise of quantum computing.

**********The number of domestic migrants is estimated to have lowered by 12% since 2011: EAC-PM
Indian Society
Why in the News?
A report by the
PM’s Economic Advisory Panel (EAC-PM)
indicates that the number of domestic migrants has decreased by approximately 12%, reaching 40.20 crore since
2011 census.
Internal/Domestic migration refers to the movement of people within a country from one region to another.
Reasons for Push factors:
Lack of job opportunities, natural disaster, lack of quality education and healthcare facilities, etc.
Reasons for Pull factors:
Economic opportunities, higher standard of living, peace and stability, etc.
What is Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Panel (EAC-PM)?
The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) is an
independent advisory body
established to provide economic insights and recommendations to the Government of India, specifically to the Prime Minister.
The term
“independent advisory body”
refers to a group that provides
expert advice and recommendations without being subject to direct control or influence
from the government or any political entity. The
Prime Minister of India
has the authority to appoint the members of the EAC-PM.
What are the key findings of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Panel (EAC-PM) report?
Decline in Domestic Migrants:
The number of domestic migrants in India is estimated to have decreased by approximately 12% from 45.57 crore in 2011 to 40.20 crore in 2023, indicating a shift in migration trends and possibly improved local opportunities.
Migration Rate and Dynamics:
The migration rate has dropped from 37.64% of the total population in 2011 to an estimated 28.88% in 2023, reflecting a significant change in the dynamics of internal migration.
Short-distance migration is predominant
, with distance negatively affecting labor mobility.
Migration originates
primarily from areas around major urban centers
like
Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, and Kolkata.
Major Migration areas:
UP-Delhi, Gujarat-Maharashtra, Telangana-AP, Bihar-Delhi (state level).
Data Sources:
The report utilized high-frequency data from various sources, including the Indian Railway Unreserved Ticketing System, mobile phone roaming data, and district-level banking data, to analyze migration patterns.
Changing Migration Patterns:
The report highlights that states like West Bengal and Rajasthan have emerged as significant destinations for migrants, while states like Andhra Pradesh and Bihar have seen a decline in their rankings as migrant sources.
What are the reasons for the decline in migrant numbers?
Improved Local Opportunities:
The decline in domestic migration is hypothesized to be due to enhanced economic opportunities and services such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and connectivity available in or near major sources of migration. This suggests that individuals may be finding sufficient opportunities locally rather than migrating.
Short-Distance Migration Dominance:
The report indicates that short-distance migrations account for a significant share of overall migration, suggesting that individuals prefer to migrate within closer proximities rather than long distances.
What are the present steps taken for the welfare of Domestic Migrants in India?
Social Security Programs:
The Indian government has established various welfare schemes aimed at providing social security to migrant workers. Notable among these are:
Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-Dhan Yojana (PMSYM):
This scheme offers a minimum assured pension of ₹3,000 per month to unorganized sector workers, including migrants, upon reaching the age of 60.
Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY):
This initiative provides health coverage of up to ₹5 lakh for secondary and tertiary healthcare, benefiting millions, including migrant workers.
Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY):
Extended for five years from January 2024, this scheme ensures food security through free food grains and cash transfers to families below the poverty line, including migrants.
Housing Initiatives:
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY):
This scheme aims to provide affordable housing to low-income groups, including migrants, through various subsidies and housing projects.
Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHC):
Launched under the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan, this initiative seeks to provide rental housing for migrant workers and urban poor.
One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC):
This scheme allows migrant workers to access subsidized food across the country using their existing ration cards, ensuring food security regardless of their location.
What are the existing challenges related to migrant workers in India?
Economic Insecurity
: Migrant workers are often employed in low-wage, unstable jobs, and their dependence on remittances makes them vulnerable to financial hardship during economic downturns.
Poor Living and Working Conditions
: Migrants often live in overcrowded, inadequate housing with limited access to basic services, and face unsafe, exploitative working conditions, especially in foreign countries.
Legal and Social Challenges
: Many migrants lack proper legal recognition and identification, hindering access to social security and leaving them vulnerable to exploitation and social discrimination.
Urban Overload
: Rapid migration strains urban infrastructure, leading to overcrowding, inadequate housing, and pressure on public services in cities, affecting migrants’ living conditions.
Way forward:
Enhance Local Economic Development
: Focus on creating more job opportunities, improving infrastructure, and expanding social services in migration-origin regions to further reduce the need for long-distance migration.
Strengthen Migrant Welfare Programs
: Ensure better implementation and outreach of existing welfare schemes, such as healthcare, housing, and food security, to protect migrant workers’ rights and well-being across all regions.

**********India’s ‘steel frame’ does need a check
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues in Indian Bureaucracy; ARC Reports;
Why in the News?
The recent government initiatives, such as “
Mission Karmayogi
,” aimed at enhancing the capacity of civil servants, underscores the ongoing dialogue about reforming India’s
“steel frame”
of governance.
What is the current state of India’s bureaucratic structure?
India’s bureaucratic structure, particularly the
Indian Administrative Service (IAS)
, often referred to as the
” of Indian governance, has historically been crucial in administration but is now struggling with
several issues:
Politicization:
Frequent transfers and promotions based on political loyalty rather than merit have undermined the professionalism and morale of IAS officers.
This politicization hampers the
development of domain expertise,
as officers are rotated across various departments without sufficient time to specialise in any particular area.
Corruption and Inefficiency:
India ranks moderately on the World Bank’s government effectiveness index, indicating persistent corruption and inefficiencies in policy implementation.
Centralized Governance:
The current governance model under the Prime Minister has led to increased centralization of power in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
What are the previous efforts taken to reform the bureaucracy in India?
Commission recommendation:
First Administrative Reforms Commission (1st ARC, 1966):
Highlighted the need for specialization within the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) to improve efficiency by transitioning it into a functional service focused on specific governance areas.
Second Administrative Reforms Commission (2nd ARC, 2005):
Proposed a transparent lateral entry process for domain experts, mandatory training for civil servants throughout their careers, and the establishment of a National Institute of Public Administration to enhance public administration education and expand the candidate pool for civil services.
Central Government initiative:
Mission Karmayogi (2020):
A capacity-building program designed to create a citizen-centric, future-ready civil service by promoting continuous learning and skill enhancement through a dedicated digital platform.
Lateral Entry Reforms:
Introduced to integrate specialized talent from diverse sectors into senior civil service roles.
Important judgments given by the Supreme Court:
T.S.R. Subramanian v. Union of India (2013):
The Supreme Court barred civil servants from following oral political directives, and mandated the creation of a Civil Services Board (CSB) to oversee transfers and postings for ensuring stability and reducing arbitrariness.
Delhi Government Services Case (2023):
The Supreme Court upheld Delhi’s legislative authority over services, reinforcing federalism and ensuring accountability of officers operating under the Delhi government’s jurisdiction.
How do proposed reforms impact the independence and specialization of civil servants?
The proposed reforms aim to modernize India’s bureaucracy by enhancing independence, accountability, and specialization among civil servants.
Lateral Entry Initiatives:
The government has introduced lateral entry into senior bureaucratic positions to bring in domain experts from outside the traditional IAS framework.
Performance-Based Promotions:
Recommendations from various administrative reform commissions
Second ARC, set up in 2005)
suggest linking promotions to measurable performance rather than seniority.
This shift could enhance accountability but may also meet resistance from entrenched interests within the IAS.
Protection Against Arbitrary Transfers:
Proposals such as the Civil Services Standards, Performance, and Accountability Bill aim to protect bureaucrats from politically motivated transfers.
Implementing such measures could bolster the autonomy of civil servants.
What risks are associated with centralizing decision-making in the bureaucracy?
Reduced Autonomy:
Centralization can diminish the independence of senior bureaucrats, making them more susceptible to political pressures.
This undermines their ability to act as effective policy executors and can lead to a culture of compliance rather than innovation.
Bottlenecks in Implementation:
A centralized approach may create bottlenecks in policy implementation, as decision-making becomes concentrated at the top.
This can slow down responses to emerging challenges and reduce the overall efficiency of governance.
Neglect of Bureaucratic Expertise:
By sidelining bureaucratic insights in favor of top-down directives, there is a risk that valuable expertise within the civil service goes unutilized. This could hinder effective policymaking and lead to poor outcomes in governance.
Way forward:
Empower Decentralized Governance:
Strengthen local and state-level administrative autonomy to reduce over-reliance on centralized decision-making, enabling more responsive and effective governance.
Implement Performance-Based Reforms:
Institutionalize meritocratic measures such as performance-linked promotions, lateral entry, and protection against arbitrary transfers to foster accountability, specialization, and independence among civil servants.
Efficient bureaucracy:
India can draw valuable lessons from the proposed
Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)
initiative to make a more efficient bureaucracy in India.
is a proposed initiative introduced by USA President which aims to streamline federal bureaucracy.

**********In today’s India, can the Constitution protect individual dignity?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Constitution of India; Individual liberty and dignity;
Why in the News?
The SC has emphasized the importance of individual dignity within the context of
Article 21
in several landmark cases.
Discussions around individual dignity have again gained traction, especially when former SC
Justice Kurian Joseph
emphasized that the Constitution prioritizes individual dignity, making it a vital topic for contemporary legal discourse.
How effectively does the Constitution safeguard individual dignity?
The Constitution of India is designed to protect individual dignity through a framework that entitles citizens to fundamental rights.
Entrenchment of Individual Rights:
The Constitution explicitly guarantees individual rights, aiming to protect the freedom and dignity of all citizens.
Fundamental Rights under Part III of the Constitution, such as the
Right to Equality (Article 14)
Right to Freedom (Articles 19-22)
, and
Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21)
, explicitly safeguard individual dignity.
Checks and Balances:
The Constitution establishes institutional checks and balances to prevent the abuse of power.
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)
, the Supreme Court broadened the scope of Article 21, holding that any law depriving personal liberty must meet the standards of fairness, justice, and reasonableness.
Political Equality:
By affirming political equality among citizens, the Constitution enables individuals to participate actively in the democratic process.
Article 326
guarantees universal adult suffrage, enabling all citizens to participate equally in democratic processes, affirming their political dignity and sense of inclusion.
What role do societal attitudes and systemic issues play in protecting dignity?
Societal attitudes and systemic issues significantly influence the protection of individual dignity under the Constitution:
Community Identity vs. Individual Rights:
The emphasis on community identity whether based on caste, religion, or nation can undermine individual dignity. When societal attitudes prioritize group identities over individual rights, it can lead to discrimination and marginalization.
Trust and Cooperation:
A lack of trust among citizens can hinder collective efforts to uphold constitutional values. When individuals measure each other against rigid identities, it subverts the freedom that the Constitution aims to protect.
Oligarchic Power:
Concentration of wealth and power can distort democratic processes, leading to a situation where certain groups’ interests overshadow individual rights. This systemic issue can erode the effectiveness of constitutional protections for dignity.
Can legal frameworks adapt to evolving understandings of dignity?
The legal framework established by the Constitution has the potential to adapt to evolving understandings of dignity:
Basic Structure Doctrine:
The Basic Structure Doctrine, established in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), ensures that core principles like dignity remain inviolable while allowing amendments to address evolving needs.
For example,
103rd Constitutional Amendment (2019)
introduced a 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in education and public employment.
Ongoing Democratic Negotiation:
The Constitution leaves questions regarding economic structure open for ongoing negotiation, allowing for discussions around justice and inclusion that are vital for protecting dignity in a changing society.
The introduction of the
Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019
marked a significant step toward affirming the dignity and rights of transgender individuals.
Judicial Interpretation:
Courts play a critical role in interpreting constitutional provisions related to dignity.
Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)
decriminalized consensual same-sex relationships by reading down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code.
Way forward:
Promoting Constitutional Values:
Enhance public awareness and foster societal attitudes that prioritize individual dignity, equality, and mutual respect over group identities.
Strengthening Institutional Adaptability:
Empower judicial and legislative mechanisms to address systemic inequities, interpret evolving notions of dignity, and implement inclusive policies.
Mains PYQ:
Examine the scope of Fundamental Rights in the light of the latest judgement of the Supreme Court on Right to Privacy.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Mitochondria, mtDNA
Why in the News?
Recent research indicates that
age-related losses
in our cell’s
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
—specifically,
deletion mutations
—could be a major driver of aging. These mutations, once they accumulate, reduce the mitochondrion’s ability to produce energy (ATP), causing cell and tissue dysfunction.
What are Mitochondria?
generate most of the cell’s energy
(hence called the Powerhouse) in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
They
originated from free-living bacteria absorbed by ancient single-celled organisms
, retaining a fraction of their own DNA (mtDNA).
Unlike nuclear DNA, mitochondria
have their own circular DNA
, though limited in size.
Humans
inherit
mitochondria exclusively
from the mother’s egg
; sperm-contributed mitochondria are generally not passed on.
They have a
double membrane
: a relatively permeable outer membrane and a highly folded inner membrane (cristae) that maximizes surface area for energy production.
Their inner compartment, the
mitochondrial matrix
, houses mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), ribosomes, and enzymes for the
Krebs cycle
(citric acid cycle) and fatty acid β-oxidation.
Mitochondria help
regulate
intracellular calcium levels
, which is crucial for various signalling pathways.
They play a
role in apoptosis
programmed cell death
) by releasing factors such as cytochrome c when the cell is under severe stress.
Functions of DNA, mRNA, and the gene:
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
Blueprint of Life
: Houses genetic instructions in the form of a sequence of bases (A, T, G, C).
Chromosomal Structure
: In the nucleus, it is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans, each carrying numerous genes.
Base-Pairing
: Two DNA strands form a double helix via base-pair bonding (A-T, G-C).
Gene
Functional Unit of DNA
: A stretch of DNA containing instructions (a few thousand base-pairs) for making proteins or functional RNA.
Expression
: When active, a gene is ‘read’ and transcribed into mRNA.
mRNA (Messenger RNA)
Intermediate Molecule
: Carries the gene’s instructions from the DNA (in the nucleus) to the cytoplasm.
Protein Synthesis
: Ribosomes read mRNA sequences, translating them into specific proteins.
Functions of the Mitochondrial Genome (mtDNA):
Encodes Key Mitochondrial Proteins
The mtDNA has 13 protein-coding genes crucial for mitochondrial energy production (ATP synthesis).
It also encodes 24 non-coding genes (like rRNAs and tRNAs), essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis.
Energy Production
mtDNA-encoded proteins form part of the electron transport chain, where most ATP is produced.
Distinct Inheritance Pattern
Inherited exclusively from the mother.
Each cell contains multiple mitochondria, each with multiple copies of mtDNA.
Implication in Aging and Disease
Age-related mutations (deletions, chimeric genes) in mtDNA can lead to functional decline in tissues like muscle and brain.
Loss of intact mtDNA reduces ATP generation, contributing to cellular and tissue ageing.
PYQ:
[2021]
In the context of hereditary diseases, consider the following statements:
Passing on mitochondrial diseases from parent to child can be prevented by mitochondria replacement therapy either before or after in vitro fertilization of the egg.
A child inherits mitochondrial diseases entirely from mother and not from father.
