**********X has challenged govt’s use of Section 79
Why in news?
Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) has challenged the Indian government's use of Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act, 2000 for content moderation and removal orders.
The company argues that this provision is being misused to bypass the safeguards provided under Section 69A, which is specifically designed for content regulation.
X contends that the government's approach undermines due process and transparency in content moderation.
What’s in today’s article?
Shreya Singhal Case & Section 69A of the IT Act
Government’s Use of Section 79 of the IT Act
X’s Legal Challenge Against Section 79(3)(b) Orders
SC Strikes Down Section 66A (2015)
In Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015), the Supreme Court struck down Section 66A of the IT Act, which criminalized sending false information causing "annoyance or inconvenience."
The Court held it unconstitutionally vague, giving excessive power to the government to restrict free speech.
Section 69A Becomes the Primary Law
After this decision, Section 69A became the main law governing online content moderation.
It empowers the Centre to block content hosted on
any digital platform if deemed necessary under Article 19(2) of the Constitution
Safeguards & Justification
Unlike Section 66A, Section 69A includes safeguards:
Blocking orders must be
reasonable restrictions
outlined in
(e.g., sovereignty, security, public order, morality, etc.).
The government must
record reasons
for blocking, allowing legal challenges.
Section 79: Safe Harbour for Intermediaries
Section 79 of the IT Act provides
"safe harbour"
protection to intermediaries (such as X), shielding them from liability for third-party content.
However,
Section 79(3)(b) states that intermediaries can be held liable if they fail to remove unlawful content after receiving actual knowledge or a government notification
SC’s Restriction on Section 79(3)(b) (Shreya Singhal Case)
Supreme Court limited
the scope of Section 79(3)(b), ruling that removal obligations apply
only when:
court order
directs removal, or
government issues a notification
, but only if the content violates
Article 19(2) restrictions
(e.g., national security, public order, defamation).
Government’s Expanded Use of Section 79(3)(b)
October 2023
: The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (
MeitY
) issued a directive allowing ministries, state governments, and police to issue
blocking orders under Section 79(3)(b)
October 2024
: MeitY launched "Sahyog", a portal enabling authorities to issue and upload blocking orders, potentially expanding censorship beyond the SC’s prescribed limits.
Allegations of Bypassing Safeguards
X has challenged the MeitY before the Karnataka High Court, arguing that its content removal orders under
The company cites the Shreya Singhal ruling, asserting that content can only be censored through Section 69A procedures or a court order.
X’s Argument on Section 79
Section 79 is only a “safe harbour” provision
that shields intermediaries from liability for third-party content.
It argues that the government is now
misusing
this provision to create an
“unlawful blocking regime”
without the legal protections mandated by law.
The Grok Controversy & Safe Harbour Debate
X’s AI chatbot, Grok 3, has been under scrutiny for using Hindi slang and posting government-critical responses.
While X hasn’t received an official notice, the Centre has reportedly contacted the company.
A key legal question now arises: Does AI-generated content fall under "third-party" content for safe harbour protection under Section 79?
Courts will need to determine whether X is liable for Grok’s responses.

**********The Grok controversy - What it reveals about AI, free speech, and accountability
Why in news?
The Indian government is engaging with Elon Musk’s X over controversial responses generated by its AI chatbot, Grok. The chatbot has produced profane and biased remarks, labelling some conservative users, including Musk, as misinformation spreaders.
Grok’s responses reflect the attitudes prevalent on the platform, raising concerns about accountability. While Grok is merely a computer code processing fed data, its "intelligence" remains debatable.
Instances like using a misogynistic Hindi expletive and making inflammatory statements have prompted users to bombard it with more questions, intensifying the debate over AI responsibility.
What’s in today’s article?
Fixing the Responsibility
Legal Accountability for AI Speech
Broader AI Regulation Challenges
Grok derives its name from the sci-fi novel Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A. Heinlein, meaning “to fully and profoundly understand something,” as explained by Elon Musk.
Musk’s ‘Anti-Woke’ AI Vision
Musk positioned Grok as a
counter to AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini
, claiming they exhibit left-wing bias.
In an interview, he expressed concerns over AI being trained to be politically correct and instead sought to create a
"spicy" and unfiltered AI
Unique Features of Grok
Access to Real-Time X Data:
Unlike other chatbots, Grok
searches and utilizes public posts on X
for up-to-date responses.
Integration with X:
Users can tag Grok in their posts to receive direct responses.
Unhinged Mode:
A feature for premium users that may generate inappropriate or offensive content.
Concerns Over Direct Publishing
Experts highlighted the
risk of unchecked AI-generated content spreading on X
, which could lead to real-world consequences like misinformation-driven violence.
He argues that Grok’s integration with X, rather than its output alone, poses the greatest threat.
Internet platforms like X, Meta, and YouTube are protected under safe harbour laws, meaning they are not liable for content posted by users.
However, whether this protection extends to AI-generated content like Grok’s responses remains a legal grey area.
The Complexity of Holding AI Accountable
Grok is trained on the open internet, including content from X users.
This raises the question: if its output is based on human-generated data, can the creators or the platform be held responsible?
Comparing it to suing the ocean for being wet, legal experts find it difficult to pinpoint accountability.
Free Speech and AI
In India, freedom of expression is a fundamental right with reasonable restrictions—but it applies to humans, not AI.
Grok’s responses are determined by its code and dataset, making the concept of "AI free speech" debatable.
Who is Responsible?
The responsibility may lie with xAI (Grok’s creators) and X for allowing unfiltered responses.
But holding developers accountable is tricky—should blame fall on high-level engineers or low-wage data annotators?
Governments worldwide are struggling with this unanswered regulatory challenge.
The question of who is responsible for AI-generated content remains complex, but legal precedents suggest that deployers of AI systems can be held liable.
Air Canada Case: AI as a Publisher
In a landmark ruling, Air Canada was ordered to honor a false refund policy created by its AI chatbot.
The court rejected the airline’s claim that it was not responsible for the chatbot’s responses.
This ruling suggests that AI chatbots can be treated as publishers under certain circumstances.
Context Matters in AI Accountability
The level of responsibility depends on the context in which an AI system is deployed.
A chatbot providing
medical guidance
would be held to a higher standard than an AI like
Grok on X
, which is used for general conversations.
Safe Harbour for AI Developers
Experts propose a safe harbour framework to protect AI developers from liability if they follow due diligence measures.
This framework could be modeled after end-user license agreements (EULAs) and user conduct policies that some companies already apply to their large language models (LLMs).
The incident highlights critical concerns:
AI-generated misinformation
Accountability for AI outputs
Content moderation difficulties
Need for procedural safeguards
It also revives debates over the central government’s
withdrawn AI advisory
from last year, signaling ongoing tensions between regulation and innovation.

**********India’s Push for GM Food Crops: Progress Amid Legal Scrutiny
Why in the News?
Ahead of a fresh series of hearings in the Supreme Court next month over genetically modified (GM) food crops, the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) said there was “progress” on this front.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context, About GM Mustard, Significance, etc.)
GM Crops (Govt Stand, SC Observation, Activist Groups’ Concerns, Way Ahead, etc.)
Background: The GM Mustard Controversy
India’s efforts to promote
are once again under national spotlight.
The Supreme Court is scheduled to begin hearings over petitions challenging the
Environment Ministry’s 2022 approval
for the
commercial cultivation of GM mustard
The debate reflects a
clash between scientific innovation and environmental activism
, with the government pushing for biotechnology advancement while activist groups question the safety and ecological impact of GM food crops.
GM Mustard and its Importance
GM mustard is India’s
first genetically modified food crop
to receive conditional approval for commercial release by the
Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)
—a scientific panel under the Ministry of Environment.
Developed using public funds, the crop was intended to
boost yields and reduce import dependency
However, due to
legal challenges and safety concerns
, it has not been cultivated commercially.
Government’s Stand on GM Crops:
Speaking at a biotechnology event, govt officials acknowledged that while the matter is sub judice,
“progress” is being made
on GM food crops.
The DBT, under the
Ministry of Science and Technology
, has long funded research into transgenic crops.
Science and Technology Minister emphasized the importance of embracing innovation, stating:
“There is so much dynamism in biotechnology development that we cannot look at tomorrow through the prism of today.”
The DBT has also submitted
technical inputs
to the Environment Ministry, which is tasked with formulating a
national policy on GM crops
, as directed by the Supreme Court in an earlier verdict.
Supreme Court Proceedings and Split Verdict:
In July 2024, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court
delivered a split verdict
on the Environment Ministry’s 2022 approval of GM mustard.
The matter was then referred to a larger bench.
The Court has asked all involved parties to submit their written statements before the proceedings begin.
The case is seen as a
landmark moment
for India’s future biotechnology and agricultural policies.
Concerns Raised by Activist Groups:
Several environmental and farmer groups have strongly opposed GM mustard, citing:
Potential ecological harm
, including threats to pollinators like bees.
Lack of long-term safety data
for human consumption.
Insufficient transparency
in the approval process.
These groups argue that GM food crops could disrupt traditional farming systems and compromise India’s biodiversity and seed sovereignty.
India’s Growing Bio-Economy and Role of GM Crops:
Despite regulatory hurdles, GM crops play a key role in India's
emerging bio-economy
, as highlighted in a report released by the DBT.
Key Highlights from the Bio-Economy Report (2024):
India’s total bio-economy value:
$165.7 billion
Bio-agriculture share:
$13.5 billion
(8.1%)
GM crops like Bt Cotton have significantly contributed to increased agricultural productivity.
Bio-industrial sector (biofuels, bioplastics, enzymes): 47% of the total bio-economy
Biopharma: 35%
Bio-IT and research services: 9%
India had 10,075 biotech startups in 2024, expected to grow to 22,500 by 2030, creating 35 million jobs.
Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana lead in bio-economy contributions.
Way Ahead:
The future of GM food crops in India depends on:
Judicial clarity
on environmental and health concerns.
Policy formulation
to balance innovation with biosafety.
Public awareness and stakeholder engagement
to address misinformation and mistrust.
With the
BioE3 policy
focusing on creating new agricultural products using biotechnology, GM crops like mustard could be part of India’s long-term strategy for
food security, climate resilience, and global competitiveness
—but only if supported by sound legal and ethical frameworks.

**********Freebies vs Welfare - The Dilemma of India’s Economic Democracy
Context:
The debate over welfare measures and freebies has resurfaced with
political parties making populist promises in elections.
While welfare schemes are meant to uplift the poor,
excessive dependence on freebies
raises
concerns about economic sustainability, self-reliance, and governance priorities
Freebies and Political Promises:
In the recent Delhi elections, political parties have
competed to offer
“
” rather than focus on
development strategies
Earlier, a prominent political party’s 2024 manifesto highlights welfare schemes such as:
PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana – free rations to 80 crore people since 2020.
Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) – ₹34 lakh crore credited to citizens.
PM Mudra Yojana – 46 crore loans worth ₹27 lakh crore.
PM SVANidhi Scheme – easy credit to 63 lakh street vendors.
The question arises:
Are these
or mere
electoral inducements
?
The Economic Burden of Freebies:
Several states, including
Maharashtra
(admit funding issues for the Ladki Bahin scheme) and
Gujarat
, struggle with funding social schemes and essential public services like education and healthcare.
The government claims
25 crore citizens have moved out of poverty, and 17 crore jobs were created in 10 years, yet freebies continue.
Critics argue
that such measures can
hinder economic productivity
foster dependency.
Constituent Assembly Debates on Socialism and Welfare:
On November 15, 1948,
a motion to declare India a socialist state
was debated but rejected.
K T Shah supported socialism
, advocating for:
Equal justice and opportunity.
Economic security for all citizens.
B R Ambedkar opposed the motion
, stating:
The Constitution should not dictate economic policies but leave them to governments elected by the people.
Prescribing socialism in the Constitution would undermine democracy.
Economic Democracy and Social Order:
Damodar Swarup Seth
(discussing Article 38, ‘State to secure a social order for the promotion of the welfare of the people’ in 1948) criticized the capitalist structure, arguing that a
socialist democratic order
was essential for
true welfare
Mahboob Ali Baig Sahib Bahadur
emphasized that political parties have distinct ideologies, and voters expect implementation of their agendas.
Ambedkar’s perspective
on economic democracy:
sets an economic ideal but
does not prescribe a specific system
Economic democracy can take
multiple forms
, including individualism and state intervention.
J B Kripalani’s vision of democracy
(1949): Democracy must be both political and economic.
The class divide in India limits economic democracy, despite political equality
India as a Welfare State - Reality Check:
A welfare state protects and promotes
the economic and social wellbeing of its citizens based on the principles of
Equal opportunities,
The equitable distribution of wealth and
Public responsibility
for those citizens who cannot afford the bare necessities of a decent life.
India faces challenges such as:
Poverty
Unemployment
Widening wealth gap
Failing healthcare
The Supreme Court in
S.Subramaniam Balaji v. State of Tamil Nadu
justified freebies, sparking debate over fiscal responsibility.
Conclusion - Need for Introspection:
E M Forster once said: “
Two cheers for democracy
. One because it admits variety and two because it permits criticism.”
In his 1845 novel Sybil (or the Two Nations - the rich and the poor), Benjamin Disraeli writes: “
Power has only one duty
— to secure the social welfare of the people.”
India must evaluate whether
excessive freebies align with sustainable economic growth and true welfare.

**********Charting a Route for IORA under India’s Chairmanship
Context
The
Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) is a crucial regional organisation
that promotes cooperation among Asian, African, and Australian nations connected through the Indian Ocean.
With
India set to assume chairmanship in November 2025
, the country has an opportunity to
strengthen
IORA’s governance and enhance its
relevance
on the global stage.
India’s priorities as chair include increasing financial resources, integrating technology for data management
, and developing maritime-ready academic programs.
Given the region’s economic significance and security challenges,
IORA’s role in developing cooperation and sustainable development is essential.
The Strategic Importance of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR)
IOR is
an integral part of the Indo-Pacific but maintains unique characteristics.
It is home to
two-thirds of the global population
and serves as a critical
hub for international trade, with 75% of global trade and 50% of daily oil consumption
passing through its waters.
region generates over $1 trillion in goods and services annually
, with intra-IORA trade reaching $800 billion in 2023.
IORA, one of the oldest intergovernmental organisations in the region,
aims to facilitate collaboration among its members
through cultural and academic exchanges, disaster risk management, and economic development.
Although
it has dialogue partners like the United States, China, and the European Union
, it primarily relies on middle and smaller powers.
However,
despite its economic importance, the IOR faces significant challenges,
including underdevelopment, political instability, climate change-induced disasters, and security threats such as piracy, terrorism, and human trafficking.
These
transnational issues necessitate regional cooperation
to find sustainable solutions.
Challenges Faced by IORA
Funding Constraints
A major challenge for IORA is its
limited financial resources.
The organisation’s
annual budget is largely dependent on the contributions of its member states
, many of which are developing countries.
This
financial model poses a problem
as the capacity of these member states to contribute substantial amounts is constrained.
Countries such as Singapore, the UAE, and France are exceptions, but the majority of IORA members are smaller
, less economically developed nations that cannot contribute significantly to the budget.
creates a funding shortfall, particularly for critical areas like maritime security,
disaster management, and sustainable economic growth in the region.
Reliance on Member Contributions
Due to the reliance on member contributions for its budget,
IORA’s financial sustainability is inherently precarious.
dependency results in fluctuations in available funding
, limiting IORA’s ability to plan long-term initiatives and execute programs effectively.
While IORA’s member states recognise the importance of the association,
they struggle to sustain continuous, large-scale funding commitments,
as they themselves face economic and political challenges.
Many member nations are engaged in their own developmental priorities
and regional concerns, leading to the prioritisation of immediate domestic issues over regional commitments to IORA.
Limited Capacity for Data Processing and Policy Analysis
Another challenge facing IORA is its
small Secretariat, which is based in Mauritius,
and its limited human resources and technological infrastructure.
Secretariat is responsible for coordinating activities across a large and diverse region
, but it operates with a relatively small staff.
Government institutions, such as IORA’s Secretariat, often suffer from bandwidth limitations
when it comes to processing and analysing large amounts of data, which is critical for timely and informed decision-making.
Given the increasing complexity of issues such as climate change, maritime security, and economic development in the Indian Ocean Region,
there is a growing need for sophisticated data management systems.
Insufficient Involvement of the Private Sector and Industry
Despite the significant role that industries such as shipping, marine tourism, oil and gas, and fisheries play in the Indian Ocean’s blue economy,
IORA has not sufficiently integrated the private sector into its policy-making processes.
Many of these industries are key contributors to the economic activities of the region, but they are
often excluded from IORA’s deliberations
on maritime policy and regional governance.
lack of private sector involvement not only restricts the flow of capital but also limits the expertise and practical solutions
that industry leaders could bring to IORA’s discussions.
India’s Role and Strategic Recommendations
India’s vision for ‘Security and Growth for All in the Region’ (SAGAR) aligns with IORA’s objectives
and offers a framework for strengthening regional cooperation.
As chair,
India can leverage its strong diplomatic ties
with member states to develop practical solutions.
Several member countries, such as Australia, have advanced research in marine science
and technology, while others like France and Singapore excel in marine-related technologies.
UAE and Oman can contribute investments in sectors where IORA needs support.
Additionally,
traditional knowledge from coastal and island nations such as Sri Lanka, Seychelles, and Mauritius should be integrated
into sustainable marine governance strategies.
To promote long-term development,
IORA should encourage collaboration between industrial leaders and academic institutions.
Marine-related employment opportunities are expected to increase, necessitating
specialized training programs.
Introducing interdisciplinary courses
, such as marine accounting,
can help build a skilled workforce for the blue economy.
Conclusion
IORA holds immense potential
for enhancing regional prosperity and security.
India’s upcoming chairmanship presents an opportunity to address existing institutional challenges
and reinforce IORA’s role as a key player in the Indian Ocean Region.
By
focusing on financial sustainability, technological integration
, and capacity-building through education and research,
India can help IORA evolve into a more effective and influential organization.
Through proactive leadership and strategic partnerships,
IORA can become a model for regional cooperation and sustainable development in the Indo-Pacific.

**********India’s Marginalised Parliament in Budgetary Affairs
Context
national budget is far more than a mere financial statement
; it is a reflection of a country's economic vision, governance philosophy, and policy priorities.
In democratic systems,
the principle of parliamentary control over public finance is fundamental
, ensuring fiscal discipline, transparency, and accountability.
However, in India, the role of Parliament in shaping the Budget remains minimal
, with an executive-driven process that sidelines legislators.
To rectify this imbalance
, critical institutional reforms, such as pre-Budget discussions and the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), must be implemented
to enhance legislative oversight and ensure a more democratic financial governance framework.
The Budget as a Pillar of Democracy
Budget serves as the financial blueprint of a nation
, determining the allocation of resources and setting the government's economic and social priorities.
Historically,
legislative control over public finance has been a cornerstone of democratic governance,
preventing executive overreach.
Across the world, different democracies have varying degrees of legislative influence over budget-making,
some parliaments actively draft and modify budget proposals, while others merely approve government proposals with limited scrutiny.
Despite these differences, one principle remains consistent:
greater parliamentary engagement in budgetary matters correlates with improved economic stability
and social outcomes.
An Analysis of Structural Weakness in India’s Budgetary Process
Executive Monopoly Over Budget Formulation
Unlike other legislative proposals,
the Budget is drafted almost entirely within the Finance Ministry, with minimal input from Parliament.
The executive,
particularly the finance minister and senior bureaucrats, play the dominant role in budgetary planning
, while even Cabinet Ministers remain largely uninformed until the final presentation.
This
secrecy stands in contrast to democratic practices in many developed nations
where the legislature is actively engaged in budget formulation. For example:
In the United States, congressional committees engage in extensive pre-Budget discussions
, and the President’s budget proposal is subjected to rigorous debate and scrutiny before approval.
In Germany and Sweden, parliamentary committees assess budget proposals well before they are finalised,
ensuring that lawmakers have a meaningful role in shaping financial policies.
In India, however, the absence of legislative involvement in the early stages of budget-making weakens Parliament’s ability
to shape fiscal policies.
By the time the Budget is presented,
its core framework is already established,
leaving little room for meaningful amendments or deliberations.
Limited Time for Debate and Review
Once the Budget is presented in the Lok Sabha,
it is expected to be debated, scrutinised, and approved within a limited timeframe.
However, parliamentary discussions on budgetary allocations are often
rushed and superficial.
government typically presents the Budget in early February,
and Parliament is expected to pass it before the end of March.
Given the extensive details of financial allocations across various sectors,
this short window leaves little opportunity for rigorous analysis.
Weak Role of Parliamentary Committees
While parliamentary standing committees are intended to provide oversight,
their influence over the Budget remains limited.
The Departmentally Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) do review demands for grants from various ministries, but
their recommendations are not binding.
government is free to disregard their suggestions
, rendering committee scrutiny largely ineffective.
In contrast,
legislative committees in countries such as Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom play a stronger role
in budget analysis.
These nations have dedicated budget offices that provide legislators with independent economic research,
ensuring that parliamentary committees can offer informed recommendations.
The Marginal Role of Rajya Sabha
Another structural weakness in India’s budgetary process is
the limited role of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) in financial matters.
While the Rajya Sabha is a key legislative body responsible for reviewing laws and policies,
it has little authority over budgetary decisions.
According to Article 110 of the Indian Constitution, the Budget is classified as a Money Bill
, meaning it is primarily the domain of the Lok Sabha (Lower House).
Once the Lok Sabha passes the Budget, the Rajya Sabha can only discuss it
cannot amend or reject it.
No Power to Modify the Budget
Perhaps the most significant limitation on Parliament’s role is the
inability to modify or amend the Budget in any meaningful way.
members of Parliament (MPs) can raise objections and suggest changes, they cannot directly alter expenditure
or taxation proposals.
Unlike in countries such
as France and Sweden
where legislators have the authority to propose alternative spending allocations
, Indian MPs lack such power.
Even within the Lok Sabha,
opposition parties often find it difficult to push for budgetary amendments, as the ruling party typically enjoys a majority
and can pass the Budget with minimal resistance.
Required Reforms to Address these Structural Weaknesses
The Need for Pre-Budget Discussions
One crucial reform to enhance parliamentary involvement in budgeting is the
institutionalisation of pre-Budget discussions.
These discussions,
held during the monsoon session,
would allow legislators to assess the nation’s fiscal health,
outline budget priorities, and contribute to economic planning.
dedicated five to seven-day debate period would enable parliamentarians to voice public concerns,
advocate for equitable resource allocation, and provide policy recommendations for the government’s consideration.
Pre-Budget discussions would also encourage better coordination among subject committees,
fostering informed and holistic decision-making.
Establishing a Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO)
Currently,
India lacks an institutional mechanism
that provides parliamentarians with independent and non-partisan budgetary analysis.
A PBO, modelled after institutions such as the U.S. Congressional Budget Office
and similar bodies in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom,
would bridge this gap by offering data-driven insights and expert economic forecasts.
well-structured PBO would play a crucial role in analysing government expenditures
, revenue projections, and fiscal policies.
It
would conduct independent economic assessments,
evaluate medium- and long-term budgetary trends, and provide parliamentarians with research-backed policy briefs
Reclaiming Parliamentary Authority in Budget-Making
The current budgetary process in India
diminishes the role of elected representatives, undermining democratic principles.
By integrating pre-Budget discussions and establishing a PBO,
Parliament can transition from being a passive approver of financial proposals to an active participant
in economic policy-making.
These reforms are not just procedural improvements
but fundamental steps toward strengthening representative democracy.
They would ensure that budgetary decisions reflect collective deliberation rather than executive fiat
, leading to more equitable economic policies and greater public trust in financial governance.
Conclusion
A truly democratic budgetary process requires more than just executive efficiency;
it demands active legislative participation and oversight.
The current system in India, which marginalises Parliament’s role, needs urgent reforms
to restore balance and accountability.
Institutionalising pre-Budget discussions and establishing a PBO would significantly enhance Parliament’s capacity
to shape economic policy, ensuring a more transparent, democratic, and effective governance framework.
By reclaiming its rightful authority
over public finance,
Parliament can reinforce its role as the guardian of India’s economic and democratic integrity.

Editorial Analysis
**********[22nd March 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Charting a route for IORA under India’s chairship
International Relations
PYQ Relevance:
Question:
Do you think that BIMSTEC is a parallel organisation like the SAARC? What are the similarities and dissimilarities between the two? How are Indian foreign policy objectives realized by forming this new organisation?
(2022)
Reason:
This question explores India’s engagement with other regional groupings. India’s experience with BIMSTEC, its objectives, and the lessons learned in fostering regional cooperation can inform its approach and strategy as the chair of IORA. It also touches upon how India uses multilateral platforms to achieve its foreign policy goals, a key aspect of its IORA leadership.
Mentor’s Comment:
The Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) held its Council of Ministers (COM) meeting in Colombo on October 11, 2024, with the theme
“Reinforcing Indian Ocean Identity.”
Foreign ministers and senior officials from its 23 member countries attended the event. In 2024, many other countries, especially
“dialogue partners”
or those wanting to join as dialogue partners, showed great interest in the organization. IORA, founded 26 years ago, is believed to have been an idea originally proposed by former South African President
Nelson Mandela.
Today’s editorial discusses issues related to the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and India’s role in it, which is useful for GS Paper 2 in International Relations.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
New Delhi should create a strong base for effective governance that works at the local level and brings real impact.
What are the key priorities for India as it prepares to chair the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA)?
Enhancing Funding Opportunities:
India can engage private sector players like
shipping companies (Maersk, Adani Ports), oil & gas firms (ONGC, Reliance), and marine tourism operators
to contribute financially to IORA’s initiatives.
Strengthening Maritime Security & Safety:
Expanding India’s
Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR)
in Gurugram to enhance real-time maritime surveillance and counter threats like
piracy, illegal fishing, and trafficking
Integrating Technology for Data Management & Policy Analysis:
Promoting
AI-driven marine data analytics
to track ocean health, predict climate change impacts, and improve fisheries management across IORA nations.
Developing Maritime Education & Skill-Based Training:
Partnering with institutions like
IIT-Madras and NIOT (National Institute of Ocean Technology)
to create specialized courses in
marine economy, deep-sea exploration, and coastal governance
Strengthening Blue Economy & Sustainable Practices:
Collaborating with
Australia for marine research, UAE for investment in sustainable fisheries, and Seychelles for traditional knowledge on marine conservation
to develop eco-friendly economic growth models.
Why is funding a major challenge for IORA?
Dependence on Member Contributions:
IORA’s budget is primarily dependent on contributions from its
23 member states
, most of which are
developing economies
. For example, Only a few countries like
Singapore, UAE, and France
have the financial capability to contribute significantly, while others struggle to meet commitments.
Limited Private Sector Involvement:
lacks strong partnerships with private enterprises
, which could provide alternative funding sources. For example, Industries related to
shipping, oil & gas, fisheries, and marine tourism
are key players in the region but are not formally involved in IORA’s funding model.
Comparatively Small Budget:
IORA’s total
annual budget is just a few million dollars
, making it insufficient for large-scale maritime security, climate resilience, and economic development projects. For example, The
Indian Ocean Commission (IOC)
, despite having only
five
members, has a
$1.3 billion budget (2020-25)
—significantly larger than IORA’s budget.
Expanding Scope of Activities:
IORA is expanding into
maritime safety, disaster management, technology, and blue economy initiatives
, all of which require
resource-intensive investments
. For example, Implementing
maritime surveillance systems
disaster risk management programs
demands consistent funding, which is currently lacking.
Lack of a Dedicated Fundraising Mechanism:
Unlike organizations like the
ASEAN Development Fund
, IORA does not have a structured mechanism to
raise funds through external donors, financial institutions, or international aid agencies
. For example, ASEAN collaborates with
ADB (Asian Development Bank)
World Bank
for project funding, while IORA lacks such institutional financial backing.
How can it be addressed?
Diversifying Funding Sources:
IORA should explore
alternative funding mechanisms
such as
public-private partnerships (PPPs)
, external grants, and contributions from
international financial institutions
Example:
ASEAN collaborates with the
Asian Development Bank (ADB)
for project funding, which IORA can emulate.
Enhancing Private Sector Engagement:
Establish formal partnerships with
shipping, energy, fisheries, and tourism industries
to attract investment in key maritime projects.
Creating an
IORA Business Forum
to facilitate corporate sponsorships and private sector-driven development projects.
Setting Up a Dedicated IORA Development Fund:
Establish a structured
where member states, international donors, and regional banks contribute for long-term sustainability.
ASEAN Development Fund (ADF)
pools resources for regional projects, which IORA can replicate to support blue economy and maritime security initiatives.
Strengthening Bilateral and Multilateral Cooperation:
Strengthen financial partnerships with
G20 economies, UN agencies, and regional economic blocs
to access technical and financial assistance.
IORA can seek support from India’s
Development Partnership Administration (DPA)
or Japan’s
Official Development Assistance (ODA)
for infrastructure and capacity-building programs.
Implementing a Tiered Membership Contribution Model:
Introduce a
differentiated contribution system
where larger economies contribute more while smaller nations have
flexible or in-kind contributions
Organizations like the
International Maritime Organization (IMO)
GDP-based contribution tiers
to ensure fair burden-sharing among members.
India’s Role in IORA – Timeline of Key Initiatives
How does the Indian Ocean Region contribute to global trade and economic activities?
Major Trade and Energy Corridor:
The Indian Ocean facilitates
75% of global maritime trade and 50% of daily oil consumption
, making it a critical route for global commerce.
The Strait of Malacca, Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Strait of Hormuz
are key chokepoints for oil and goods transportation.
Rich Blue Economy and Marine Resources:
The region generates
$1 trillion in goods and services
, including fisheries, aquaculture, and seabed resources.
India, Indonesia, and Thailand
have thriving fishing industries, while
Mozambique and Madagascar
are rich in offshore gas reserves.
Strategic Economic Hubs and Ports:
Major ports like
Singapore, Mumbai, Colombo, and Dubai
serve as global transhipment and logistics hubs, driving regional and global trade.
Gwadar (Pakistan) and Hambantota (Sri Lanka)
are being developed as part of strategic maritime infrastructure projects.
Where can India leverage its strengths and partnerships to enhance IORA’s governance and effectiveness?
Maritime Security and Disaster Resilience:
India can take the lead in
strengthening maritime surveillance, anti-piracy measures, and disaster preparedness
in the Indian Ocean region.
can be expanded to assist IORA members in real-time maritime domain awareness.
Capacity Building and Skill Development:
India can offer
training programs, scholarships, and technical assistance
to IORA members in areas like
blue economy, digital governance, and climate adaptation
Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC)
program can be expanded to provide skill development for professionals from IORA nations.
Sustainable Blue Economy Initiatives:
India can collaborate with IORA countries to promote
marine biotechnology, sustainable fisheries, and ocean-based renewable energy
Deep Ocean Mission
and expertise in
offshore wind energy
can be shared with IORA nations for sustainable development.
Trade and Connectivity Infrastructure:
India can enhance
regional trade and connectivity
through port modernization, maritime logistics, and
blue economy-driven trade facilitation
Sagarmala Project
can be leveraged to assist IORA nations in upgrading
port infrastructure and coastal shipping networks
Multilateral Partnerships and Development Finance:
India can work with
Quad, G20, BRICS, and ASEAN
to secure additional funding and policy coordination for IORA’s initiatives.
India’s leadership in
the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)
can be extended to help IORA nations build
climate-resilient maritime infrastructure
Way forward:
Institutional Strengthening & Financial Sustainability:
IORA should establish a
dedicated development fund
, diversify revenue streams through
, and enhance cooperation with global financial institutions like the
World Bank and ADB
to ensure long-term financial stability.
Strategic & Inclusive Engagement:
India must promote
technology-driven governance
capacity-building initiatives
regional connectivity projects
while fostering multilateral partnerships with
ASEAN, Quad, and BRICS
to enhance IORA’s strategic relevance and effectiveness.
**********India’s marginalised Parliament in budgetary affairs
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to Budget;
Why in the News?
The current budget process reduces the involvement of elected representatives, weakening democratic accountability.
How does the current budget process reduce the role of elected representatives and weaken democratic accountability?
Executive Monopoly Over Budget Formulation:
The Budget is drafted exclusively by the Finance Ministry, with even Cabinet Ministers kept unaware until its presentation in the Lok Sabha.
Example
: Unlike legislative bills, the Union Budget is not subjected to extensive cabinet discussions before being tabled in Parliament.
Lack of Pre-Budget Consultations:
Parliamentarians do not have an institutional mechanism to provide input before the Budget is finalized.
: In contrast to countries like the UK, where parliamentary committees discuss budget priorities in advance, India lacks such structured engagement.
Limited Role of the Rajya Sabha:
The Upper House has no direct power to amend or reject the Budget, reducing its ability to scrutinize financial policies.
: The Finance Minister, even if a Rajya Sabha member, cannot vote on the Budget in the Lok Sabha, where financial matters are decided.
Weak Oversight by Parliamentary Committees:
Parliamentary committees do not have the authority to modify budget proposals or demand policy changes.
: Department-related Standing Committees review Demands for Grants but can only make recommendations, which the government is not bound to accept.
Time Constraints and Superficial Debates:
The Budget session allows limited time for discussion, leading to rushed approvals without in-depth scrutiny.
: In many cases, the
Guillotine Process
is used, where multiple Demands for Grants are passed without discussion due to time limitations.
What is the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO)?
A
is an independent, non-partisan institution that provides objective analysis of government budgets, fiscal policies, and economic forecasts to assist lawmakers in informed decision-making. It enhances legislative oversight, ensures transparency, and improves accountability in public finance management. Examples include the
U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
and Canada’s PBO.
What about the constitutional status of the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO)?
There is no explicit mention of a
Indian Constitution
. However, its establishment can be linked to broader constitutional provisions related to financial oversight and legislative accountability:
Article 112 (Annual Financial Statement)
– The Union Budget is presented before Parliament, which has the power to scrutinize and approve it. A PBO can strengthen this oversight by providing independent budgetary analysis.
Article 266 & 267 (Consolidated and Contingency Funds of India)
– Parliament controls government expenditure, and a PBO can assist in evaluating the fiscal implications of such spending.
Article 148-151 (Comptroller and Auditor General – CAG)
– While CAG audits past expenditures, a PBO would provide forward-looking budgetary insights to Parliament.
Article 105 (Powers and Privileges of Parliament)
– Parliament has the right to seek information on financial matters, and a PBO could serve as a resource for unbiased fiscal analysis.
Why is the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) considered essential for fiscal oversight?
Independent and Data-Driven Budget Analysis:
A PBO would provide legislators with non-partisan, expert analysis of government spending, revenue forecasts, and fiscal policies.
conducts independent evaluations of federal budgets, ensuring transparency and evidence-based policy decisions.
Enhanced Legislative Scrutiny and Accountability:
It would strengthen Parliament’s ability to evaluate the financial implications of policies and hold the executive accountable.
: Countries like
Canada and the UK
have PBOs that assess fiscal policies, preventing governments from making unrealistic budgetary claims.
Support for Informed Decision-Making by Legislators:
Parliamentarians often lack technical expertise in financial matters; a PBO would equip them with research reports and policy briefs.
Australia’s PBO
helps legislators understand the long-term economic impact of proposed policies, ensuring fiscal discipline and responsible budgeting.
How do pre-Budget discussions contribute to a more transparent and democratic Budget-making process?
Greater Legislative Involvement and Accountability:
Pre-Budget discussions allow parliamentarians to voice public concerns, debate fiscal priorities, and influence resource allocation before the Budget is finalised.
Germany
, the Bundestag conducts pre-budget debates, ensuring the government considers legislative recommendations before finalizing financial plans.
Improved Public Participation and Transparency:
Open discussions increase public awareness and trust by making the Budget-making process more inclusive and participatory.
South Africa
holds public consultations before the Budget, allowing citizens to provide inputs, and ensuring financial policies align with public needs.
Better Coordination Among Subject Committees:
Structured discussions help parliamentary committees collaborate effectively, leading to more informed scrutiny of sector-wise allocations.
Sweden
, parliamentary finance committees review preliminary budget proposals, enabling sector-specific recommendations before the final Budget is tabled.
Which global models of legislative Budget scrutiny can India learn from to enhance parliamentary engagement?
Country
Features
United States – Congressional Budget Office (CBO) for Independent Analysis
provides independent, non-partisan economic and budgetary analysis to assist lawmakers in evaluating fiscal policies.
India could establish a
for similar fiscal oversight.
United Kingdom – Strong Parliamentary Committee System:
UK’s House of Commons Treasury Committee
scrutinizes budget proposals, questioning government officials and publishing reports on financial policy.
In 2021, the Treasury Committee analyzed the economic impact of the UK Budget and made recommendations for pandemic recovery, influencing fiscal decisions. India can strengthen its
to enhance budgetary oversight.
Germany – Pre-Budget Consultations for Legislative Input:
Bundestag (German Parliament)
conducts structured pre-Budget discussions, allowing legislators to debate fiscal priorities before finalizing budgetary allocations.
Germany’s
Medium-Term Financial Planning Framework
ensures that multi-year fiscal policies align with economic goals. India could introduce
to improve transparency and parliamentary engagement.
Way forward:
Establish a Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) for Independent Analysis:
should be set up to provide
non-partisan, expert-driven financial analysis
to Parliament, similar to the
. This would enhance
legislative oversight, fiscal transparency, and informed decision-making
by equipping parliamentarians with independent budget assessments.
Institutionalize Pre-Budget Consultations and Strengthen Committee Oversight:
Implement
involving parliamentary committees, policymakers, and stakeholders to ensure
greater transparency and inclusivity
in Budget-making.
Mains question for practice:
Question:
“The growth of cabinet system has practically resulted in the marginalisation of the parliamentary supremacy.” Elucidate.
(UPSC 2024)
Reason:
This question addresses the broader theme of parliamentary supremacy being undermined by the executive. The budget being primarily an executive-driven process, with limited parliamentary influence, is a prime example of this marginalization.
**********Judge’s transfer is not related to ‘rumours’: SC
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to the judiciary;
Why in the News?
On Friday (March 21, 2025), the Supreme Court stated that false information and rumours were being spread about an “incident” at the home of Delhi High Court Judge Justice Yashwant Varma, suggesting that this led to his transfer. The Court clarified that the transfer decision was unrelated to the incident.
What was the Supreme Court’s response to the reports regarding the incident at Justice Yashwant Varma’s residence?
Rejection of Misinformation:
The Supreme Court dismissed media reports about a “huge pile of cash” being recovered during a fire at Justice Varma’s residence.
Example:
It stated that rumours and misinformation were being spread, clarifying that the reports were not verified facts.
Clarification on Transfer Proposal:
The Court confirmed that Justice Varma’s transfer to Allahabad High Court was an independent decision, unrelated to the in-house enquiry into the incident.
It emphasized that the transfer process had been initiated separately and was being reviewed by the Collegium before the enquiry even began.
Confidentiality of the Enquiry Process:
The Supreme Court maintained that the in-house enquiry was confidential and aimed at preserving judicial integrity.
The Court cited the 2015
Additional District and Sessions Judge ‘X’ vs. Registrar General, MP High Court
judgment, which ensures fairness in such proceedings.
What is in-house enquiry?
An
is an internal judicial procedure to investigate allegations against sitting High Court and Supreme Court judges. It ensures fairness, follows principles of natural justice, and maintains confidentiality. The process involves preliminary assessment by the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court, followed by a deeper probe if necessary.
What is the legal precedence of it?
Justice V. Ramaswami Case (1991):
One of the first instances where an impeachment motion was attempted against a sitting Supreme Court judge, highlighting the importance of in-house mechanisms before formal parliamentary action.
Additional District and Sessions Judge ‘X’ vs. Registrar General, High Court of Madhya Pradesh (2015):
This case outlined the two-stage procedure for in-house enquiries, emphasizing exclusion of bias and ensuring due process in judicial investigations.
In re: Justice C.S. Karnan (2017):
The Supreme Court invoked its contempt jurisdiction against a sitting High Court judge, Justice C.S. Karnan, highlighting the limitations of in-house procedures when misconduct disrupts judicial functioning.
Why did the Supreme Court emphasize that the transfer proposal for Justice Yashwant Varma was independent of the in-house enquiry?
To Prevent Misinterpretation of Judicial Transfers:
The Supreme Court clarified that the transfer was part of routine administrative decisions, not a punitive action linked to the enquiry.
Justice Varma’s transfer was to his parent High Court (Allahabad), where he would be ninth in seniority, a common practice for judges.
To Uphold the Collegium’s Credibility:
The Court ensured that the Collegium’s decisions were based on judicial requirements, not external events.
The Collegium followed its standard procedure of consulting judges and the Chief Justices of the concerned High Courts before deciding on the transfer.
To Avoid Pre-Judgment of the Enquiry Outcome:
If the transfer was seen as linked to the enquiry, it could imply guilt before a formal investigation was concluded.
The Court confirmed that the Delhi High Court Chief Justice had initiated the enquiry separately, even before the Collegium met on March 20, 2025.
To Maintain Judicial Independence and Fairness:
Judges must be free from undue influence, and linking transfers to allegations could undermine judicial autonomy.
The Court cited the in-house enquiry framework, which ensures that any probe follows due process before any action is taken.
To Protect the Reputation of the Judiciary:
Associating the transfer with allegations could harm the judge’s integrity and create unnecessary controversy.
The Supreme Court press note stressed that the transfer decision was made on administrative grounds, separate from any enquiry findings.
What is the process of judicial transfers in India?
Initiation by the Chief Justice of India (CJI):
The transfer of High Court judges is initiated by the CJI in consultation with the Collegium, which includes the four senior-most Supreme Court judges. Example: In 2021, Justice Sanjib Banerjee was transferred from the Madras High Court to the Meghalaya High Court, reportedly due to administrative reasons.
Consultation with the Government and Affected Judges:
The Union Law Ministry processes the recommendation and seeks the President’s approval. The judge being transferred is consulted, but their consent is not required. Example: Justice Akil Kureshi’s transfer from Gujarat High Court to Tripura High Court in 2019 sparked debates about judicial independence.
Final Approval by the President of India:
After receiving recommendations from the CJI and the Collegium, the President issues a formal order for the transfer under Article 222 of the Constitution.
Justice Vijaya Kapse-Tahilramani resigned in 2019 after being transferred from the Madras High Court to the Meghalaya High Court.
How does the in-house enquiry procedure against sitting High Court judges ensure fairness and prevent bias?
Two-Stage Investigation Process:
The procedure involves an initial assessment by the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court, followed by a deeper probe if required, ensuring a systematic and impartial review.
In Justice Yashwant Varma’s case, the Delhi High Court Chief Justice first examined the allegations before forwarding a report to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) for further action.
Principles of Natural Justice:
The accused judge is given a fair opportunity to present their defense before any decision is made, preventing arbitrary actions.
If the CJI determines a deeper probe is needed, a three-member committee (two Chief Justices and one High Court judge) is formed, ensuring multiple perspectives in the investigation.
Confidentiality to Protect Integrity:
The enquiry remains confidential to prevent media trials and undue reputational damage before conclusions are drawn.
The Supreme Court’s press note stated that the findings of the Delhi High Court’s in-house enquiry would be examined privately before deciding on further action.
Way forward:
Strengthening Transparency and Communication:
The judiciary should proactively address misinformation by issuing timely clarifications and making non-confidential aspects of administrative decisions more accessible to prevent speculation and misinterpretation.
Enhancing Institutional Safeguards:
The in-house enquiry mechanism should be periodically reviewed to ensure procedural robustness, fairness, and adaptability while maintaining judicial integrity and independence.
Mains PYQ:
Question:
“Constitutionally guaranteed judicial independence is a prerequisite of democracy”. Comment. (2023)
Reason:
The proposed transfer of a High Court judge, especially amidst “rumours” touches upon the independence of the judiciary. While the Supreme Court clarifies the transfer is unrelated to the “incident” and in-house inquiry, questions about maintaining judicial independence in the face of potential external pressures or perceptions remain pertinent.
