Nilgiri tit Butterfly
Recently, Butterfly enthusiasts from the Nilgiris have recorded for the first time in India, the Nilgiri tit Butterfly (Hypolycaena nilgirica) utilising a large terrestrial orchid plant as a host.
About Nilgiri tit Butterfly:
It belongs to the
family Lycaenidae.
It was first described in 1884 from Coonoor in the Nilgiris, it has since been recorded in Sri Lanka.
It was also found in Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary of Idukki district, and Silent Valley National Park of Palakkad district in Kerala.
Appearance
The male is dark
reddish purple-brown
on the upper side. It has two black spots capped in orange near the tails. The female is pale brown.
Habitat:
They inhabit forests and lush home gardens, especially those with orchids.
It was noted to lay its eggs on the inflorescence (complete flower head) of the larval host plant,
Eulophia epidendraea
, a terrestrial orchid species.
This is the first known record of the butterfly using this particular species of plant as a host.
This terrestrial orchid was found on rocky slopes in humid areas.
This endemic butterfly is classified under
Schedule II of the Wildlife Protection Act

**********Caenorhabditis elegans
Recently, while accepting the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this year, molecular biologist Gary Ruvkun spent a few minutes lauding his experimental subject: a tiny worm named Caenorhabditis elegans.
About Caenorhabditis elegans:
It is a
nematode worm
which is a small, relatively simple, and
precisely structured organism.
elegans grows within 3-5 days from a fertilised egg to a millimetre-long adult, and it has informed profound insights into the human body, as well as biology.
It is widely used in research to understand
neuronal and molecular biology.
It was the first multicellular organism to have
its full genome sequenced
and neural wiring mapped.
It has two sexes—a
hermaphrodite and a male.
The hermaphrodite can be viewed most simply as a female that produces a limited number of sperm: she can reproduce
either by self-fertilization
, using
her own sperm
, or by cross-fertilization after transfer of male sperm by mating.
Self-fertilization allows a single heterozygous worm to produce homozygous progeny.
What are Nematodes?
These are any worm of the
phylum Nematoda.
These are among the most abundant animals on Earth.
They occur as parasites in animals and plants or as free-living forms in soil, fresh water, marine environments, and even such unusual places as vinegar, beer malts, and water-filled cracks deep within Earth’s crust.
Features
Nematodes are bilaterally symmetrical,
elongate, and usually tapered at both ends.
Some species
possess a pseudocoel
, a fluid-filled body cavity between the digestive tract and the body wall.

**********Malaria
Recently, Egypt was officially declared ‘malaria-free’ by the World Health Organization (WHO).
About Malaria:
It is an
acute febrile illness
caused by
Plasmodium parasites
, which are spread to people through the bites of
infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
It is a life-threatening disease primarily
found in tropical countries.
Transmission
not contagious
and cannot spread from one person to another; the disease is transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes.
Five species of parasites can cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species –
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
– pose the greatest threat.
Symptoms
The first symptoms of malaria usually begin within 10–15 days after the bite from an infected mosquito.
Fever, headache and chills
are typically experienced, though these symptoms may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria.
In malaria endemic areas, people who have developed partial immunity may become infected but experience no symptoms.
Prevention:
Vector control interventions:
Vector control is the main approach to prevent malaria and reduce transmission.
Treatment:
preventable and curable
Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease and prevents deaths, and also contributes to reducing transmission.

**********India and China arrived at a patrolling agreement along the LAC
Why in news?
In a major diplomatic breakthrough, India and China have agreed to resume patrolling at key friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. This agreement follows years of military standoffs since the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, which had left both nations in a deadlock.
What’s in today’s article?
Galwan attack and situation thereafter
Key highlights of the recent patrolling agreement along the LAC
Significance of this agreement
Galwan Clash
In May 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed at various points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
These points included: Pangong Tso, Galwan Nalah and Demchok in Ladakh and at Naku La (a mountain pass at an altitude of over 5000 metres) in Sikkim.
Later, a violent clash at Galwan Valley started between Indian troops and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on the night of June 15, 2020.
After this incident, both sides deployed a large number of troops in the area along with heavy weaponry.
Corps Commander level talks
Since then, India and China have held multiple rounds of the talks at Corps Commander level on the LAC in Eastern Ladakh area to resolve the standoff.
Friction points
There are seven friction points in eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese troops have had confrontations since May 2020.
These include PP 14 (Galwan), PP 15 (Hot Springs), PP 17A (Gogra), north and south banks of Pangong Tso, Depsang Plains (the Chinese had cut off Indian access to the PPs there) and Charding Nullah.
Restoration of Patrolling Rights in Depsang Plains and Demchok
India and China have agreed to restore patrolling rights in the Depsang Plains and Demchok regions of eastern Ladakh, addressing long-standing "legacy issues" that predate the 2020 Chinese incursions.
Indian troops will now be able to patrol up to Patrolling Points (PP) 10 to 13 in Depsang and Charding Nullah in Demchok.
Agreement on Patrolling Protocols
Both sides will patrol up to the old points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with Indian patrols occurring twice a month.
The strength of each patrol will consist of 14-15 troops to avoid clashes.
Patrol programmes will be coordinated, with any clashing dates being mutually modified to prevent misunderstandings.
Eastern Theatre and Other Friction Points
While agreements have been reached on Depsang and Demchok, friction points like Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso remain unchanged.
Discussions regarding the eastern sectors, particularly sensitive areas in Arunachal Pradesh, are still ongoing.
Confidence-Building Measures
The pact aims to restore trust between the two countries through monthly commander-level meetings and case-specific talks.
Both sides aim to reduce the overall deployment of troops along the LAC, a process already planned for winter.
Rekindling hope
The pact has rekindled hopes of early restoration of diplomatic and bilateral political ties.
This agreement assumes significance since the Chinese side, until a year ago, showed reluctance to even discuss them while it agreed on disengagement at other friction points.
Depsang Plains is significant
The Depsang Plains is 30 km southeast of the strategically important Daulat Beg Oldie post near the Karakoram Pass in the north.
Also, in the midst of mountainous terrain, it offers a flat surface which can be used by either of the two countries to launch a military offensive, similar to the Spanggur Gap in the Chushul sub-sector.
Bottleneck, a rocky outcrop about 7 km east of Burtse (an Indian Army base), connects key areas in the Depsang Plains.
Located on the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road, Bottleneck is also known as the Y-Junction due to its forked track.

**********Bioluminescence
Recently, Chennai recently experienced a captivating natural spectacle as bioluminescent waves illuminated its coastline, drawing the attention of both residents and tourists.
About Bioluminescence:
It is a natural phenomenon produced by certain
marine organisms
, primarily microscopic
plankton called dinoflagellates.
These planktons emit light on the ocean surface at night.
Bioluminescence is widespread among deep sea animals in general.
Many marine creatures like sponges, jellyfish, worms, species of fish, arthropods, echinoderms and unicellular alga exhibit bioluminescence to either evade predators, attract prey or during mating.
This occurs when the
luciferase enzyme reacts with luciferin
compound in the presence of oxygen to produce a cold light.
This is widespread in lagoons and sometimes breakwaters and is particularly visible
during warm weather conditions.
The dinoflagellates follow a circadian cycle (24-hour cycle) and as a result this phenomenon occurs during the night which is visible in low light conditions.
This unique phenomenon has been visible in some other beaches in India including Havelock Island in the Andamans, Thiruvanmiyur beach in Chennai, Mattu beach in Karnataka and Bangaram Island in Lakshadweep.

**********What is the Nature Restoration Law (NRL)?
The Nature Restoration Law (NRL), which was enacted by the European Union (EU), is an inspiring model from which India can draw points to tackle its growing environmental crises.
About Nature Restoration Law (NRL):
It is a
law to tackle the triple crises of
climate change
biodiversity loss,
and
environmental degradation
It is the
first continent-wide, comprehensive law of its kind.
It is a key element of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, which
sets binding targets
to restore degraded ecosystems
, in particular those with the most potential to capture and store carbon and to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters.
Under the NRL,
Member States
will
have to restore at least 20% of the EU’s land and sea by 2030,
including terrestrial, coastal, and freshwater, forest, agricultural, and urban areas.
By 2050
, the
measures should extend to all ecosystems "requiring restoration".
The EU NRL also targets an
obligation to improve urban green spaces
, contribute to
free-flowing rivers by removing artificial barriers
increase pollinator populations,
and contribute to the target of
3 billion additional trees
throughout the EU.
States must adopt "restoration plans"
detailing how they intend to achieve these targets and ensure that the restored areas do not significantly deteriorate.
While drafting these Nature Restoration Plans, Member States also
need to consider socio-economic impacts and benefits
and estimate the financial needs for its implementation.

**********How South India Deals with its Aging Population?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
India’s Aging Population (Statistics, Concerns, Way Forward, etc.)
Background:
In an unexpected move,
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu
announced that his government is working on a law to incentivize families to have more children.
His concerns arise from the state's
declining young population
, with fertility rates below the
replacement level
According to the CM, having fewer than two children is leading to a rapid decline in the younger population, and this could have long-term implications for the state.
Context & Concerns of Southern States:
CM’s remarks are part of a broader discussion regarding population trends in
Southern India
Southern states, like
Tamil Nadu
Kerala
, have successfully brought down their
over the years.
This success has contributed to an
aging population
, creating concerns about the future representation of these states in the
Indian Parliament
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister
M.K. Stalin
even raised concerns about the potential reduction of South India's share in parliamentary seats due to low population growth.
India's Aging Population and Fertility Trends:
With the
2021 Census
delayed, the most recent data on population projections come from a
2020 report
by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
The report highlights several key findings:
Across India, the percentage of people aged
60+
is expected to increase significantly.
However, this trend is more pronounced in Southern states, which achieved
low fertility rates
earlier than their Northern counterparts.
For example,
Uttar Pradesh
is projected to reach the replacement level of fertility (2.1 children per woman) only by 2025, more than two decades after Andhra Pradesh.
Population Growth
Between
2011 and 2036
, India's population is expected to grow by
31
1 crore
people.
Half of this growth will come from just five states:
Bihar
Maharashtra
West Bengal
Madhya Pradesh
On the other hand, the five Southern states (
AP
Karnataka
Telangana
) will contribute only
2.9 crore
to the total population increase during the same period.
Older Population Doubling
The number of elderly persons (aged 60+) is expected to more than double, from
10 crore in 2011
23 crore in 2036
, for example, nearly
1 in 4 people
will be over 60 by 2036. In contrast,
is projected to have a younger population, with only
12%
of its people in the 60+ bracket by 2036.
Why is an Aging Population a Concern?
An aging population and smaller overall population are two distinct issues.
An aging population raises concerns about the
dependency ratio
—the percentage of the population that is not working (those below 15 and above 60).
A high dependency ratio means that a larger portion of the population relies on the working-age group for economic support.
As a result, the state may have to invest more in
healthcare
social security
for the elderly.
On the other hand, a
smaller population
compared to other states could impact political representation in the
Lok Sabha
(House of the People).
Southern states, which achieved demographic transitions earlier, fear they could be penalized during
electoral delimitation
, losing seats in Parliament to Northern states like
, where population growth continues to be higher.
Do Pro-Natalist Policies Work?
CM cited examples from countries like
Japan
China
Europe
, where governments have attempted to boost fertility rates to counter aging populations.
experts
argue that
pro-natalist policies
—policies encouraging families to have more children—have had limited success.
According to these experts, these policies generally fail, particularly in societies that have achieved a certain level of prosperity and education.
While
Scandinavian countries
have managed to stabilize fertility rates to some extent through
family support systems
childcare services
gender equality measures
, countries like
have not seen significant success.
Even offering financial incentives is not enough to encourage families to have more children, as shown in the case of countries like
France
South Korea
Why CM Naidu’s Comments Matter?
CM’s remarks mark a
significant shift
in the political discourse surrounding population. Several decades ago, India faced concerns about
overpopulation
, with high fertility rates leading to rapid population growth.
Back then, politicians and policymakers were focused on controlling population growth to avoid potential crises.
, played a crucial role in achieving
Replacement Level of Fertility
Andhra Pradesh, for instance, reached the fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman in 2004.
In fact, Andhra Pradesh once had a law that barred individuals with more than two children from contesting local elections—a law that the CM repealed.
However, with declining fertility rates and India now being the
world's most populous country
, the political conversation is evolving.
The challenge now is
balancing population control
with ensuring there are enough young people to support economic growth.
What is the Way Forward?
have proven largely ineffective, experts suggest that
migration
could help address demographic imbalances.
Internal migration
from Northern to Southern states could alleviate the issue of a shrinking workforce in the South
Southern states can benefit from this by absorbing migrants who are already of working age, thus bypassing the costs associated with raising and educating a young population.
This is similar to the model employed by the
United States
, where immigration has helped sustain the country's
economic dominance
by providing a steady flow of working-age individuals.
Economists also argue that India's focus should be on
improving the productivity
of its labor force, rather than simply increasing the population.
By ensuring that India capitalizes on its ongoing
demographic dividend
—a large share of the population being of working age—the country can maximize economic growth.
Conclusion:
considers incentivizing larger families, the broader debate around
comes to the fore.
While the state faces real challenges related to its declining young population, global evidence suggests that
may not be the answer.
Instead, a combination of
labor productivity improvements
, and a focus on the
could help balance India's population and economic needs.

**********Dealing with Fake Bomb Threats in Aviation
Why in News?
Over the past week, nearly 100 fake bomb threats, mostly from anonymous social media accounts, have raised significant concerns about aviation safety in India.  Although all the threats turned out to be hoaxes, they caused widespread disruptions for airlines, passengers, and crew members.
In this context, there is the need to analyse security protocols when a flight gets a bomb threat and the government and Ministry of Civil Aviation’s (MoCA) efforts to deal with/ avoid similar situations in the future.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Bomb Threat Response Protocol
Response to Recent Spate of Fake Bomb Threats Targeting Indian Airlines
Legislative Action to Curb Fake Bomb Threats in the Aviation Sector
Conclusion
Bomb Threat Response Protocol:
Mid-air bomb threat:
Upon receiving a bomb threat during a flight, the Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) convenes to evaluate the credibility of the threat.
Pilots coordinate with Air Traffic Control (ATC) to determine whether to return to the departure airport, continue to the destination, or divert to the nearest airport.
Pre-departure bomb threat:
If the threat occurs before take-off, the aircraft is moved to a secluded bay for thorough checks in coordination with the BTAC.
International flights:
In cases where bomb threats target international flights outside Indian airspace, Indian agencies work with international ATC and security agencies to divert the flight to the nearest airport.
Response to Recent Spate of Fake Bomb Threats Targeting Indian Airlines:
Swift response from airlines:
Airlines immediately activated anti-terror protocols and contacted the MoCA for assistance. Despite strict security measures, each threat was treated with caution.
Inter-Ministerial coordination:
The MoCA, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and agencies such as the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) are coordinating closely to address the spate of threats.
Enhanced security:
In response to the threats, security has been tightened at airports with an increase in security checks by 10%.
CCTV coverage has also been expanded to ensure that no suspicious items are carried on board.
MoCA is working towards enhancing security protocols.
Deterrence and investigation efforts:
The BCAS and airport-specific Bomb Threat Assessment Committees (BTACs) are adopting a dynamic approach to evaluate each threat based on recent cases.
While ensuring passenger safety, the committees aim to minimise disruptions by refining the assessment process.
Tracking culprits
The government is actively working to trace those responsible for the fake threats,
but the use of VPNs and anonymous social media accounts has made tracking difficult
Efforts are underway to collaborate with social media platforms and VPN providers to identify the perpetrators.
Legislative changes:
The Indian government is planning legislative changes to deal with fake bomb threats targeting airlines, aiming to impose harsher punishments and strengthen deterrence.
Legislative Action to Curb Fake Bomb Threats:
Current arrangement:
Currently, such hoax bomb threats are dealt with in accordance with the country’s criminal laws, as there are no legal provisions dealing specifically with bomb threats to aircraft.
Amendments to Aircraft Security Rules:
The government plans to modify the Aircraft Security Rules (governed by the Aircraft Act 1934) to include culprits of hoax bomb threats in the no-fly list, effectively banning them from boarding flights.
This is currently limited to unruly passengers on board but would be expanded to those sending threats via social media or other external means.
Changes to SUASCA Act, 1982:
Amendments to the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Civil Aviation (SUASCA) Act are proposed.
Currently, the Act applies to in-flight incidents, but the government seeks to broaden its scope to cover bomb threats even when the aircraft is grounded, making such offences cognizable under the law.
This would also include heavy fines and possible jail time.
Conclusion:
The surge in hoax bomb threats is causing serious disruptions to Indian airlines and placing significant pressure on aviation security.
The government is taking steps to tighten regulations,
but the challenges of responding to and mitigating such threats continue to strain the system

**********Z-Morh project in Kashmir
Why in news?
On October 20, suspected militants attacked workers of APCO Infratech, an infrastructure company constructing the Z-Morh tunnel on the Srinagar-Sonamarg highway in Jammu and Kashmir.
Seven workers were killed in this attack, marking the first militant assault on a key infrastructure project in the region. Previously, militants had not targeted such projects in Jammu and Kashmir.
What’s in today’s article?
Revival of Terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir - analysis
About
The Z-Morh tunnel is a 6.4-kilometer tunnel connecting the Sonamarg health resort with Kangan town in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district.
It is located near Gagangir village, just ahead of Sonamarg, and
will ensure all-weather connectivity to the popular tourist destination
on the Srinagar-Leh highway.
The tunnel gets its name from the Z-shaped road stretch at the construction site.
Commencement of the project
The Z-Morh tunnel project, originally conceived by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in 2012, was initially awarded to Tunnelway Ltd.
Later, the National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) took over the project.
Although expected to be completed by August 2023, the project faced delays.
A soft opening took place in February 2024, but the official inauguration was postponed due to the Model Code of Conduct in place for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections.
Need for the tunnel
The stretch where the tunnel is under construction is situated at an altitude of over 8,500 feet, and is prone to snow avalanches in the winter.
The road to Sonamarg as such remains closed for most part of the winter.
Strategic importance of the Z-Morh tunnel
The Z-Morh tunnel, part of the larger Zojila tunnel project, aims to ensure year-round connectivity from Srinagar to Ladakh.
Zojila tunnel, connecting Sonamarg to Drass in Ladakh
, is under construction and expected to be completed by December 2026.
While the Z-Morh tunnel will provide all-weather access to the Sonamarg health resort, it is crucial for
maintaining quick military access to Ladakh
The Z-Morh tunnel is key to enabling all-weather road connectivity between Srinagar, Drass, Kargil, and Leh, reducing dependence on air maintenance for forward military positions.
This will improve troop and supply transport, lower costs, and extend the life of aircraft used by the Indian Air Force.
The project is vital for Indian defense forces deployed in Siachen and Eastern Ladakh, where tensions with Pakistan and China persist.
Recent terror attack on infra project in J&K and the exposing of vulnerabilities
The terror attack on workers of APCO Infratech, constructing the Z-Morh tunnel, marks a significant event in Jammu & Kashmir.
It reflects the revival of terrorism and points towards a broader strategy aimed at exposing vulnerabilities in the region.
The incident suggests a deliberate effort by
Pakistan’s deep state to derail peace and stability
, especially after the peaceful elections and installation of a democratic government in Srinagar.
Deep state is an alleged secret network of especially nonelected government officials and sometimes private entities (as in the financial services and defense industries) operating extralegally to influence and enact government policy
Pakistan’s Deep State and its Role
The Pakistani deep state appears determined to re-establish its relevance in J&K by instigating violent events.
Their goal is to obstruct India's process of stabilizing J&K, particularly after the abrogation of Article 370.
A strategic terror event like this attack is seen as a way to prevent peace dividends from taking root and ensure continued instability.
Targeting Peripheral Areas and Infrastructure Projects
While traditional urban areas like Srinagar, Anantnag, and Baramulla remain heavily secured, the attackers have shifted focus to peripheral regions with low security.
The Z-Morh tunnel, a flagship infrastructure project, requires a large workforce and specialized expertise.
The attack may indicate a larger threat to infrastructure projects in J&K’s peripheral regions, such as the Kishanganga project and railway projects in Banihal and Qazigund.
Possible Chinese angle
The People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF), a Pakistani terror group, issued a statement praising The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba, for the recent attack in Jammu and Kashmir that killed seven civilians.
PAFF described the attack as "strategic" and claimed it was meant to disrupt Indian military deployments toward the eastern border, also citing "Chinese friends" as part of their justification.
While China and Pakistan have known strategic ties, there is no evidence of Beijing’s involvement so far.
Broader Pattern of Unusual Activities
The attack could be part of a wider scheme targeting India’s emerging strategic confidence
Recent events such as bomb hoaxes, strange blasts, and diplomatic pressure over transnational issues appear connected, signaling a broader attempt to put India on the defensive.
Conclusion
The proxy war in J&K is far from over. While the frequency of violence has decreased, complacency must be avoided, and efforts should focus on combating terror networks, financing, and drug mafias to sustain stability in the region.
