NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS UP 40 % IN 40 YEARS
Syllabus
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
Context:
Emissions of planet-warming nitrous oxide gas rose by 40 per cent between 1980 and 2020, a study by the Global Carbon Project revealed recently.
Background:-
China (16.7 per cent), India (10.9 per cent), US (5.7 per cent), Brazil (5.3 per cent) and Russia (4.6 per cent) were the top five emitters of the gas more potent than carbon dioxide and methane.
About NITROUS OXIDE
Nitrous oxide commonly known as laughing gas is a chemical compound, an oxide of nitrogen with the formula N2O.
At room temperature, it is a colourless non-flammable gas, and has a slightly sweet scent and taste.
At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidiser similar to molecular oxygen.
Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anaesthetic and pain-reducing effects.
Its colloquial name, “laughing gas” is due to the euphoric effects upon inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anaesthetic.It is on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines.
Most recreational users are unaware of its neurotoxic effects when abused. When used chronically, nitrous oxide has the potential to cause neurological damage through inactivation of vitamin B12.
It is also used as an oxidiser in rocket propellants, and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines.
It is a major scavenger of stratospheric ozone, with an impact comparable to that of CFCs.
Being the third most important greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide substantially contributes to global warming. Reduction of emissions is a popular topic in the politics of climate change.
Key Takeaways from the study
Agricultural production and livestock rearing were the two key human-driven sources of nitrous oxide.
In the last decade agricultural production, chiefly owing to the use of nitrogen fertilisers and animal manure, contributed to 74 per cent of the total anthropogenic nitrous oxide emissions, according to the study.
The world’s farmers used 60 million metric tonnes of commercial nitrogen fertilisers in 1980. By 2020, the sector used 107 million metric tonnes.
Nitrous oxide is also emitted from natural sources such as oceans, inland water bodies and soil. These sources contributed to 11.8 per cent of the global emissions of the gas between 2010 and 2019.
Agriculture activities and related waste generation, biomass burning, fossil fuels and industries together contributed to around six per cent of the global nitrous oxide emissions in 2010-2019, the study noted.
The study involved examination of global data for all major economic activities that lead to nitrous oxide emissions and 18 anthropogenic and natural sources and three absorbent “sinks” of global nitrous oxide.
The High levels of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere can deplete the ozone layer and compound effects of climate change, the study said. On the earth, excess nitrogen contributes to soil, water and air pollution.
Among the 18 regions considered in this study, only Europe, Russia, Australasia, and Japan and Korea had decreasing nitrous oxide emissions.
Europe had the largest rate of decrease between 1980 and 2020, resulting from reduced fossil fuel and industry emissions.
China and South Asia, on the other hand, had the largest increases in nitrous oxide emissions from 1980 to 2020 at 92 per cent.
Nitrous oxide emissions from human activities must decline in order to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius as established by the Paris Agreement.Reducing nitrous oxide emissions is the only solution since at this point no technologies exist that can remove nitrous oxide from the atmosphere.

RAM PRASAD BISMIL
Prelims & Mains – HISTORY
11th June marked the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Ram Prasad Bismil.
His ideals of freedom struggle stood in contrast to that of Mahatma Gandhi and he would reportedly say “independence would not be achieved by means of non-violence”.
About RAM PRASAD BISMIL
Ram Prasad Bismil (11 June 1897 – 19 December 1927) was an Indian poet, writer, and revolutionary who fought againstBritish Raj.
He composed poetry in both Urdu and Hindi, using pen names like Ram, Agyat, and Bismil.
Early Life:
Bismil was born on June 11, 1897, in Shahjahanpur district (present-day Uttar Pradesh, India).
He came from a Brahmin family and showed early talent for writing patriotic poetry.
Bismil learned Hindi from his father and Urdu from a moulvi.
Despite his father’s disapproval, he attended an English-language school and joined the Arya Samaj.
Revolutionary Activities:
At 18, Bismil read about the death sentence passed on Bhai Parmanand, a scholar and companion of Har Dayal.
Angered by this, he composed a Hindi poem titled “Mera Janm” (My Birth), expressing his commitment to removing British control over India.
Bismil was associated with the Arya Samaj and became a founding member of the revolutionary organization Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).
Conspiracies :
Bismil participated in the Mainpuri Conspiracy of 1918 and the Kakori Conspiracy of 1925.
Bismil got his name etched as a prominent freedom fighter with his participation in the Mainpuri conspiracy of 1918.
Bismil along with Genda Lal Dixit, a school teacher from Auraiya, organised youth from Etahwah, Mainpuri, Agra and Shahjahanpur districts to strengthen their organisations, ‘Matrivedi’ and ‘Shivaji Samiti’.
He published a pamphlet titled ‘Deshwasiyon ke Naam’ and distributed it along with his poem ‘Mainpuri ki Pratigya’ on January 28, 1918. To collect funds for the parties, they looted government coffers.
The Kakori train robbery, masterminded by Bismil, aimed to fund revolutionary activities.
On August 9, 1925, Ram Prasad Bismil along with companions Ashfaqulla Khan and others executed the plan of looting the train at Kakori near Lucknow.
After the revolutionaries stopped the 8-Down Saharanpur Lucknow passenger train at Kakori, Ashfaqullah Khan, Sachindra Bakshi, Rajendra Lahiri and Ram Prasad Bismil subdued the guard and looted cash meant for the treasury.
Within a month of the attack, the angered colonial authorities arrested more than a dozen HRA members.After the trial in the so-called Kakori conspiracy, these four revolutionaries were sentenced to be hanged.

GENERAL ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULE (GAAR)
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
The Telangana High Court has made a significant ruling regarding the General Anti-avoidance Rule (GAAR).
The court ruled against a taxpayer, Ayodhya Rami Reddy Alla, in a case where the revenue department had invoked GAAR. This decision is notable as it marks the first judgment on GAAR since its implementation in April 2017.
About General Anti-Avoidance Rule
General Anti-Avoidance Rule is an anti-tax avoidance law in India, aimed at curbing tax evasion and preventing tax leaks.
Implemented on April 1, 2017, under the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Objective of GAAR:
To check aggressive tax planning strategies that lack commercial substance.
To ensure that transactions are not structured solely to avoid taxes.
Key Features of GAAR:
GAAR can be invoked for transactions that are legal but are entered into primarily to avoid tax.
It distinguishes between acceptable tax mitigation and unacceptable tax avoidance or evasion
Tax mitigation is allowed under the Act, even after GAAR’s implementation.
Tax evasion, which is illegal, is not covered by GAAR as existing laws address it.
Tax avoidance, though not illegal, is considered undesirable if it undermines effective tax collection.
GAAR vs BEPS:
GAAR is often discussed in relation to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).
BEPS refers to tax avoidance strategies by Multinational Corporations (MNCs) to shift profits to tax havens, thus eroding the tax base.

ETHICS AND CRIMINALIZATION OF POLITICS
Mains – GS 4
: As the largest democracy in the world, India has been grappling with a recurring and complex problem: the widespread menace of Criminalization of Politics.
This complex issue not only undermines democratic principles but also harms the difficult process of developing and enacting public policy. A long shadow has been cast over the course of the country’s progress due to the predominance of individuals with criminal backgrounds dominating politics.
Criminalization of Politics:
It refers to the involvement of individuals with a criminal record in the political arena. It can include criminals running for and being elected to positions in parliament and state legislatures.
It often occurs due to the close relationship between politicians and criminal elements.
Ethical challenges related to the Criminalization of Politics:
Few members from the legislative wing who are facing serious criminal charges reveal a pattern of defending individuals accused of serious offenses relating to women, indicating the separation from ethical norms across party lines. This separation often originates from intense partisanship and prioritization of power over ethical conduct.
Many times, there are failures to address misconduct within the political class, which undermines accountability and ethical standards.
The recent case of Prajwal Revanna which faced severe public outrage catalyzed action within political parties. However, the reactive nature of political responses to scandals highlights a broader issue of accountability within democratic systems.
Even when the members are at fault through their misconduct, parties often remain inactive until forced to address the public outcry, emphasizing the need for more robust mechanisms of accountability beyond public pressure.
A culture of impunity diffuses through the political sphere, where norms and rules are inconsistently enforced, placing the burden of accountability on individual women.
Despite widespread agendas on women’s empowerment, substantive progress on women’s issues such as respect, equality, and security
remain unaddressed. While women are mobilized as voters and beneficiaries of welfare schemes, their collective concerns often remain on the periphery of political agendas.
Only an equitable representation for women won’t suffice to politically empower women. The disconnect between representation and empowerment is evident in the limited impact of bodies like the National Women’s Commission.

**********Why Centre Should Not Junk Arbitration to Settle Disputes
Context
On June 3,
the Finance Ministry of India unveiled a policy decision
that marks a significant
departure from decades of promoting the country as an arbitration hub.
The
government has now decided to exclude arbitration clauses from future contracts
involving government or government-controlled entities, with some exceptions.
It is important to analyse this policy shift
because it raises several concerns and appears fundamentally flawed for several reasons.
The Government’s New Policy on Arbitration
The new policy is
set out in the form of an Office Memorandum
and provides that the
government departments/ entities/ agencies should amicably settle as many disputes
as possible.
These
entities will solve disputes in overall long-term public interest, keeping legal and practical realities in view, without shirking or avoiding responsibility
or denying genuine claims of the other party.
To facilitate amicable settlement, the government agencies will constitute high-level committees
composed of former judges/retired senior officials to vet or approve such settlements.
If settlement efforts do not work out,
the dispute
will be left to the courts for adjudication.
Major Reason Behind the Policy Shift: Government’s Distrust in Arbitrators
core rationale behind this policy change is the government's perception that arbitrators often lack integrity
and collude with private parties, leading to unfavourable awards that are difficult to challenge legally.
However,
this distrust overlooks the foundational principles of arbitration
where arbitrators are expected to be independent and impartial,
resolving disputes based on merits rather than government preferences.
assumption that adverse decisions indicate compromised tribunals fails to acknowledge
the possibility
that governmental agencies might simply be failing to meet their legal obligations.
Why the Government’s Policy Change Argument is Fundamentally Flawed
Lack of Accountability and Transparency in the New Policy
If the government does not trust arbitrators
as such (though it usually nominates former Supreme Court or High Court judges as arbitrators),
why would it repose greater trust in its officials in negotiating a settlement?
It matters little that the settlement is approved by a high-level committee (comprising inter alia of former judges) as it is and
will remain a voluntary, administrative decision.
A mediator (if involved) cannot advocate any particular position
and they can only facilitate (and not recommend) any settlement.
In terms of transparency and accountability,
a settlement can never rest on an equal footing with an award which is issued following a judicial process
and by a process known to law.
Underestimation of Complexities Involving a Dispute Settlement
policy's reliance on amicable settlements underestimates the complexities
involved in negotiating substantial disputes.
Government officials are bound by stringent rules
and answerable to multiple authorities, including courts and investigative agencies.
The fear of potential scrutiny or allegations of arbitrariness and discrimination may deter officials from agreeing to significant liabilities
, thereby hindering effective settlement of disputes.
The 2023 Vivad se Vishwas – II scheme exemplifies this issue
, where the government proposed a substantial discount on awarded sums rather than honouring arbitral decisions, indicating a lack of commitment to fair and equitable settlements.
Courts' Inadequacy for Commercial Disputes
According to the new policy if settlement negotiations fail,
the policy leaves disputes to the courts.
Indian courts are notoriously overburdened and ill-equipped
to handle complex commercial disputes efficiently.
2015 Amendment to the Arbitration Act aimed to expedite award challenges within a year,
yet in practice,
these challenges can linger for about five years.
Original suits involving substantial stakes
, extensive documentation, intricate facts, and expert testimony would exacerbate this problem,
leading to prolonged litigation and further burdening the judicial system.
Implications of India's Shift from Arbitration to Court Adjudication
Diminished Investor Confidence
Investors,
both domestic and international,
seek predictable and reliable legal frameworks
to safeguard their investments.
Arbitration, with its structured yet flexible procedures, provides a relatively quick and efficient means
to resolve disputes.
By moving away
from arbitration,
India risks eroding investor confidence
as the legal process becomes more uncertain and protracted.
The potential for lengthy and unpredictable court battles may deter investors
, who might perceive the legal environment as increasingly hostile or unreliable.
Slowdown in Infrastructure Development
India has ambitious plans for infrastructure development
to support its growing economy and meet the needs of its population.
Major infrastructure projects often involve complex contracts and significant financial stakes
, making disputes almost inevitable.
Arbitration has been a preferred method for resolving such disputes
due to its efficiency and the expertise of arbitrators familiar with commercial and technical aspects.
The shift to court adjudication could delay the resolution of disputes
, leading to stalled projects, increased costs, and missed deadlines.
Increased Costs and Resource Allocation
The judicial system in India is already burdened with a backlog of cases.
Introducing a large volume of commercial disputes into this system will exacerbate the problem,
leading to longer resolution times and increased costs for all parties involved.
Companies may need to allocate more resources to legal battles, diverting funds that could have been used for expansion
, innovation, or other productive activities.
increased litigation costs can also make India a less attractive destination
for businesses, further hampering economic growth.
Impact on Contractual Relationships
Contracts are the foundation of commercial relationships.
The predictability and enforceability of contractual terms are crucial for businesses.
Arbitration clauses in contracts provide a clear and reliable mechanism for dispute resolution.
By removing arbitration clauses, the government introduces uncertainty
into contractual relationships.
Businesses may become more cautious in their dealings with government entities, potentially leading to less collaboration and innovation.
The trust deficit can result in higher risk premiums
, making projects more expensive and less viable.
Potential for Increased Corruption
The reliance on court adjudication
and settlement negotiations conducted by government officials
may inadvertently increase the potential for corruption
Settlement processes lack the transparency and structured oversight inherent in arbitration.
Decisions made behind closed doors without the rigor of judicial or arbitral scrutiny can lead to perceptions,
or even instances, of bias and unfair practices.
This can
further damage the business environment
, making it less attractive to honest investors and entrepreneurs.
Stifling Innovation and Entrepreneurship
A slow and unpredictable dispute resolution system can stifle innovation and entrepreneurship.
Startups and innovative enterprises often operate with limited resources
and cannot afford prolonged legal battles.
efficiency of arbitration can be crucial for these entities
, allowing them to resolve disputes swiftly and focus on growth and development.
By removing arbitration, the government risks creating a hostile environment for startups, potentially stifling the innovation
that is essential for economic dynamism and competitiveness.
Conclusion
The government's decision
to abandon arbitration
in favour of amicable settlements and court adjudication is misguided and counterproductive.
This policy not only fails to address the root concerns but also introduces new challenges
that will hinder India's economic and infrastructural development.
A swift reversal of this short-sighted policy is imperative to ensure a robust and reliable dispute resolution framework
that supports the country's growth ambitions.

Editorial Analysis
**********China's Grey-Zone Warfare Tactics Against Taiwan
Why in news?
China has adopted sophisticated grey-zone warfare tactics against Taiwan following the inauguration of new Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, who has made pro-independence and secessionist statements.
What’s in today’s article?
Grey zone warfare
About
Grey zone warfare generally means a
middle, unclear space that exists between direct conflict and peace in international relations.
Multitude of activities fall into this zone — from nefarious economic activities, influence operations, and cyberattacks to mercenary operations, assassinations, and disinformation campaigns.
Other experts include economic actions too, such as debt traps and economic sanctions.
Features
Activities in the grey zone have always been a feature of great-power competition.
Proxy wars, destabilizing insurgencies, legal warfare (lawfare), and information warfare—by adversaries and allies alike—have been a feature of this conflict.
Experts claim that such methods are often employed by parties who have not had access to massive resources or power, traditionally. Therefore, such tactics can help gain an advantage over a more technically well-equipped adversary that is more used to conventional warfare.
Origin
Experts believe the Cold War era, which began after the end of the Second World War in 1945, led to conditions that favoured grey zone warfare.
Amid the US-USSR rivalry for ideological and economic dominance, the knowledge that both parties were armed with nuclear weapons meant direct conflicts had to be restrained.
In today's nuclear age, the price of traditional wars has become too high, and the danger of things getting worse is very serious.
Because of this, countries are trying to achieve their goals by being aggressive in secret or by hiding.
Examples of grey zone warfare
Experts from the US and Europe have characterised certain Russian and Chinese actions of late as examples of grey zone warfare.
It includes the Chinese military’s presence in the South China Sea.
The Philippines is one of the countries which has challenged China’s claims, extending over around 80 per cent of the region.
In December 2023, it termed the presence of more than 135 Chinese maritime militia vessels near a disputed reef as illegal.
It accused China of firing water cannons at its boats and ramming into others, while the Chinese coast guard blamed the Philippines for hitting Chinese boats.
A recent Reuters report mentioned that Taiwan has been expressing concerns for the past four years about increased military actions by China.
This includes Chinese fighter jets flying over the strait regularly.
It is part of China's strategy to pressure Taiwan with activities that fall just short of starting a full-scale conflict.
Analysts claim that the US has also engaged in similar tactics.
These include its economic sanctions against China and imposition of duties on Chinese imports to the US, along with maritime reconnaissance.
Grey zone warfare - a separate category of action
The challenges that grey zone warfare poses differ from those of an open conflict.
Here, action is often covert or indirect, meaning a country’s response needs to be appropriate in terms of its scale.
These actions could be designed to bait the other party into escalation.
If this happens, the use of force would then be legitimised as a form of self-defence or response in kind to what the other party does.
Other reasons for engaging in such tactics include the projection of strength, and to normalise disputed territorial claims by repeatedly marking a presence in those regions.
Judging by its appearance, grey zone conflict seems mild when compared to traditional strategic competition.
However, the limited intensity does not make grey zone conflict less vicious.
Rather than escalate in one-dimension, grey zone conflict tends to escalate in multiple dimensions and leads to unintended over-escalation, creating a nightmare for crisis management.
New Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's tenure is marked by pro-independence and secessionist statements. As a result, China has shifted to sophisticated grey-zone warfare tactics targeting Lai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
Tactics employed by China
These tactics include psychological operations, simulated invasion scenarios, and economic measures aimed at weakening Taiwan without direct military engagement.
The PLA Eastern Theater Command conducts training drills to demonstrate combat readiness, while 3D animations and videos depict potential missile strikes.
China also employs
cognitive tactics
, such as disseminating propaganda videos and fliers within Taiwanese territories to influence public opinion and create ideological divisions.
Economically, China has
suspended preferential tax rates
for Taiwanese chemical imports to leverage economic interdependence for political concessions.
These measures continuously pressure and destabilize Taiwan, challenging President Lai’s administration to navigate and counter these grey-zone tactics effectively.

**********NEET-UG Results Controversy
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article, Government’s Stand)
About NEET & NTA
About NEET-UG Controversy (NTA’s Response)
Conclusion
Background:
On June 13
, the Supreme Court was reviewing petitions challenging the award of grace marks to 1,563 candidates from six NEET centres who experienced technical issues and weren't given the full 3.2 hours to complete the exam.
These grace marks were awarded based on a court order and a recommendation from a committee formed by the National Testing Agency (NTA).
Petitioners argued that the grant of grace marks was arbitrary and lacked transparency.
Union Government’s Stand:
The Union government informed the Supreme Court that the scorecards of 1,563 candidates who received grace marks in the NEET-UG 2024 exam on May 5 will be cancelled.
These candidates will have the opportunity to retake the exam on June 23, with results expected by June 30 and counselling starting on July 6.
The affected candidates will be notified of their actual scores without the grace marks and can choose to either take the re-test or accept their revised scores as final.
About National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET):
The NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is an entrance examination for students who wish to pursue undergraduate medical courses (MBBS/BDS) and postgraduate courses (MD/MS) in government or private medical colleges.
Objective
: To standardize the admission process for medical and dental courses across India, ensuring a uniform evaluation of candidates' eligibility.
(NTA) conducts NEET on behalf of the Ministry of Education.
About National Testing Agency (NTA):
The NTA is an autonomous organization in India responsible for conducting entrance examinations for higher educational institutions.
The NTA was established in November 2017 by the Ministry of Education to standardize and streamline the conduct of entrance exams across the country.
: To improve the quality and transparency of entrance examinations, ensuring fairness and efficiency in the assessment process.
Functions
Conducting Exams
: The NTA conducts various national-level entrance examinations for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate programs.
Developing Question Papers
: The NTA is responsible for developing high-quality question papers.
Result Processing
: The NTA processes examination results efficiently, ensuring timely release of scores and ranks.
Headquarters
: New Delhi
Overall, the National Testing Agency plays a crucial role in India's education system by providing a reliable, transparent, and efficient framework for conducting entrance examinations.
About the NEET-UG Results Controversy:
On June 4, the National Testing Agency (NTA) released the results for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test, Undergraduate (NEET UG) 2024 examination.
Approximately 2.4 million candidates participated
in the NEET UG test held on May 5 across 571 cities, including 14 centers outside India.
The exam sought to fill the
1,08,940 available MBBS seats
distributed among more than 700 medical institutions nationwide.
Allegations
Post evaluation, there have been complaints about the unusually high number of students (67) who hit the
perfect score of 720/720
Also, there are complaints about students who scored
“statistically impossible” marks
, while some cases of
cheating by proxy
were also reported.
Other cases pertaining to the
question paper leak
are still to be heard by the Supreme Court.
These charges led to nationwide protests from students and political parties.
Both groups are demanding a fair investigation and a fresh NEET exam, citing concerns about a question paper leak that may have given some students an unfair advantage.
Experts and students argue that the integrity of NEET, designed to regulate medical admissions and ensure quality, was compromised by these reported violations.
NTA’s Response:
NTA officials attributed the unusually high number of full scores to an "
easy paper
".
However, it has formed a four-member committee to investigate the allegations.
The committee found that awarding compensatory marks to 1,563 students created a "skewed situation."
They noted that grace marks should have been limited to attempted questions and recommended canceling the test for these students.
Conclusion:
Students and education experts are dissatisfied with canceling the NEET exam for only 1,500 students, arguing that this acknowledges an error and the entire May 5 exam should be re-conducted for all candidates.
They claim this
partial cancellation indicates a failure of the system and has led to a loss of faith, as expressed on social media
Critics argue that instead of ensuring fair competition, the current conduct of NEET has created additional layers of privilege.
Given the exam's large scale, with over 23 lakh students across 4,500 centers in multiple languages, minor issues are expected.
However, after nearly a decade, it's reasonable to expect that the exam's initial problems should be resolved.
They believe that preventing fraud and ensuring fair administration should be possible for government agencies.

**********Mercy Petition and Powers of President
Why in News?
President Droupadi Murmu has rejected a mercy petition filed by Pakistani national Mohammed Arif who was sentenced to death for the December 22, 2000 terrorist attack at the Red Fort in which three people including two Army jawans were killed.
The President’s decision came after Arif failed to obtain relief from the Delhi High Court and Supreme Court in his appeals against a trial court order of 2005. He can challenge the President’s decision and prolong the proceedings further.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is a Mercy Petition and Powers of President?
What is the New Provision under the BNSS?
What are the Existing Legal Precedents on Death Sentences?
Recommendations of the Law Commission of India
Under Article 72 of the Indian Constitution
, the President shall have the power -
To grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or
To suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of a death sentence.
Similarly,
Article 161
confers pardoning powers on the governor, but these do not extend to death sentences.
In Maru Ram vs. Union of India (1981)
, the SC held that while deciding mercy petitions under Article 72,
the President must act on the advice of the council of ministers
This means, the President is
bound by the Cabinet’s advice
and can only return the plea for reconsideration once under
Article 74 (1)
If the Council of Ministers decides against the changes suggested by the President, she has no option but to accept them.
Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) 2023
(not yet implemented), the proposed replacement for the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), contains a new provision on mercy petitions in death sentence cases
What is the New Provision on Mercy Petitions under the BNSS?
Section 473(1) of the BNSS
allows a convict (under the sentence of death) to file a mercy petition before the President of India under Article 72 or before the Governor of the State under Article 161 of the Constitution.
Following this, the mercy petition may be
presented to the Centre
or the state government’s Home Department, as the case may be.
On receiving the mercy petitions,
will consider the petition along with the case records, and then
make recommendations to the President on this behalf.
After this,
the President may decide
and dispose of the plea and
no appeal shall lie in any Court
against the order of the President made under Article 72 of the Constitution.
In a nutshell, this provision
aims to do away with appeals against the President’s decision on mercy petitions
, thereby making it final.
It also means that the
courts will no longer be able to go into the grounds
on which the President pardons or commutes death sentences.
In Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980)
, the SC upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty, but established that the death penalty should be awarded in the
rarest of rare cases
In October 2006,
In Epuru Sudhakar vs Andhra Pradesh (2006)
, the SC held that the powers of the President or Governor under Articles 72 and 161 are
subject to judicial review
In Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India (2014)
, the SC observed that every prisoner enjoys his/her rights under
Article 21
till his last breath.
If there is
undue, unexplained and inordinate delay
in execution due to pendency of mercy petitions, this Court is well within its powers under Article 32 to commute the death sentence into life imprisonment.
Recommendations of the Law Commission of India:
The Commission in its 262nd Report (2015) recommended the
absolute abolition of the death penalty
for all crimes
other than terrorism related offences
and waging war.
Article 72 of the Constitution provides additional protection against possible miscarriage of justice and therefore
cases found unfit for mercy should be punished with the death penalty.

**********G7 Summit in Italy - Leaders agree to lend Ukraine
Why in news?
The Group of Seven (G7) countries are meeting for the Leaders’ Summit in Italy’s Apulia region between June 13 and 15. Italy had assumed the group’s presidency earlier this year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also attending the summit as India has been invited as an Outreach Country. This visit will mark his first foreign trip in his third term as Prime Minister.
During the first day, the participating leaders have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival.
What’s in today’s article?
Agenda at the 2024 G7 summit
$50 billion loan to Ukraine
Origin
The origin of G7 lies in the
oil shocks of 1973 and the corresponding financial crisis
In order to address the situation after oil shock, the heads of the
world's six leading industrial nations decided to hold a meeting in 1975
These six nations were -
US, UK, France, Germany (West), Japan and Italy
These countries were
joined by Canada in 1976
Current Members:
US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan
It can be said that the members of this group are the
most developed and the advanced economies of the world
European Union is also represented
within the G7.
Purpose of G7
To determine the course of multilateral discourse
To shape political responses to global challenges.
It provides a platform to discuss and coordinate solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.
Power of G7
The G7 is
not based on a treaty
and has
no permanent secretariat or office
. The agenda of G7 is set by the presiding nation.
cannot pass any laws
because it is made up of separate nations with their own democratic processes. However, decisions taken by G7 have global effects as the member countries are political and economic heavyweights.
G7 & G8
In 1998, Russia was formally inducted in the group, which transformed
G7 into G8
However, Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. As a result, it was suspended from the grouping. Hence, the
group became G7 again in 2014
Significance of G7
Economic Significance
G7 nations account for
~
60% of global net wealth
~ 30% of global gross domestic product
~ 10% of the world's population.
Political Significance
In 1999, it created the Financial Stability Forum in order to manage the international monetary system
47
summit in June 2021 had focused on the recovery from ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It promised to
distribute 1 billion vaccines
to poorer countries.
Its theme was
Global Action to Build Back Better
Developmental Significance
G-7 provided $300 million in 1997 to help build the containment of the reactor meltdown at Chernobyl.
G7 played crucial role in setting up a global fund to fight malaria and Aids in 2002.
In October 2020, G7 finance ministers backed an extension of a
G20 bilateral debt relief initiative for the world's poorest countries
Criticism of G7
Declining economic might
The relevance of G7 has been questioned in recent years as the combined share of its members in global GDP has fallen.
The economic growth of China, India and other emerging economies has led to calls for a more representative global governance structure.
In comparison, the G20, which was established in response to the 2008 financial crisis, is seen as a more inclusive forum.
G7’s ability to achieve cooperation within the group
Then US President Donald Trump was often at odds with other G7 leaders and at the 2019 summit, he skipped a meeting on climate issues.
Proposal to reconfigure the group
Leaders had proposed a reconfigured G7+, which would include a common euro-zone representative and make space for China, India, and Brazil.
The summit aims to coordinate economic policies to stabilise the global economy amidst concerns over inflation and trade tensions.
It will focus on addressing climate change by discussing strategies to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable energy sources.
With climate records tumbling recently, collective action is key to addressing such problems.
In light of the lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic, the G7 will prioritise global health initiatives, including pandemic preparedness and vaccine distribution.
Additionally, the summit will address geopolitical tensions, including relations with China and Russia, and ongoing conflicts with global implications.
During the ongoing G7 summit in Italy, the participating leaders agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival.
Interest earned on profits from Russia’s frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral
The US and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.
That basically was money being held in banks outside Russia.
Most of the money would be in the form of a loan mostly guaranteed by the US government, backed by profits being earned on roughly $260 billion in immobilised Russian assets.
The vast majority of that money is held in European Union nations.

**********China’s ‘grey-zone’ warfare tactics against Taiwan | Explained
International Relations
Why in the news?
Since President Lai Ching-te took office in Taiwan, China has reacted strongly to his pro-independence remarks by using sophisticated tactics against his Democratic Progressive Party.
Background of the China-Taiwan issue
The conflict has its roots in the
Chinese Civil War (1927-1950)
between the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) and the Communist Party of China. After the Communist victory in 1949, the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan, establishing the Republic of China (ROC) there, while the Communist Party proclaimed the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland.
China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province that must eventually be reunified with the mainland, while Taiwan sees itself as a distinct, democratic entity. This
dispute over Taiwan’s political status is at the heart of the ongoing tensions
between China and Taiwan.
The strategic importance of Taiwan lies in its location in the “first island chain” in the western Pacific, as well as its dominance in the global semiconductor industry. Control over Taiwan would enhance China’s ability to project power in the region and potentially threaten US interests, while Taiwan’s independence is seen as crucial by the US and its allies
What Are the Coercive Measures China Has Imposed on Taiwan?
Military Pressure:
China’s People’s Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command (PLA ETC) conducts regular training drills and simulated invasion scenarios to demonstrate its military capability. These include 3D animation videos depicting missile attacks on Taiwan, aiming to intimidate and exert psychological pressure.
Grey-Zone Warfare:
Continuous sorties by PLA fighter jets, UAVs, and strategic fighters over and around Taiwan. These operations are designed to wear down Taiwan’s defence forces through sustained pressure and intelligence gathering.
Economic Coercion
: China suspended preferential tax rates for 134 chemical imports from Taiwan, which were previously granted under the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA). This move was a retaliation against pro-independence statements by Taiwan’s new president, Lai Ching-te, and Taipei’s restrictions on over 2,000 Chinese imports.
China’s Ideology and Political Tactics
Cognitive Warfare:
Deployment of ideological narratives within Taiwan to influence public opinion. For instance, Chinese citizens dropped fliers via drones on Kinmen Island, promoting messages against Taiwan’s independence and framing it as a dead end.
Propaganda
: These cognitive warfare tactics aim to initiate public discussions and garner attention for the Chinese cause, leveraging social media to propagate Beijing’s ideological stance.
Carrots and Sticks Approach(Political Tactics)
Carrots:
Favorable treatment towards Taiwan’s opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), which holds relatively pro-mainland views. The KMT engages with Communist Party of China (CPC) officials, maintaining communication and collaboration that the DPP lacks. The KMT’s interactions with CPC officials have sometimes led to investigations under Taiwan’s ‘anti-infiltration law’.
Sticks:
Coercive economic measures targeting Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to seek political concessions. The suspension of preferential tax rates for Taiwanese chemical imports is one such tactic.
Conclusion:
Taiwan must navigate China’s multifaceted ‘grey-zone’ tactics through resilience in defense, strategic alliances, and international advocacy to safeguard its sovereignty and democratic identity amid escalating pressures.

**********How will the EU elections impact Southeast Asia?
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Pivot to South Asia
Why in the news?
A weak performance by green and left-wing parties, coupled with gains by the far-right, could lead the EU to adopt a more protectionist stance and a less environmentally focused foreign policy.
What happens in the EU parliament?
Legislative Role and Trade Agreements:
The European Parliament must approve all EU free trade agreements. For instance, it is currently involved in negotiations with Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. This approval process ensures that any trade agreement aligns with EU standards and regulations.
Policy Shifts Due to Election Results:
The recent gains by far-right factions in the European Parliament could shift legislative priorities. For example, a more nationalist Parliament may prioritize protectionist policies over liberal trade agreements, potentially imposing tariffs or restrictions on imports from Southeast Asia, as seen with past tariffs on Cambodian and Myanmar rice.
Influence on Environmental and Human Rights Policies:
With the Greens and Liberals losing seats, the European Parliament may place less emphasis on environmental sustainability and human rights. This shift could affect initiatives like the Just Energy Transition schemes with countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, which rely on EU support for their green agendas. Reduced focus on these areas could hinder such cooperative efforts.
Changes in the Commission
Commission Presidency and Coalition Dynamics:
Ursula von der Leyen, the incumbent European Commission President from the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), faces a challenging re-election. She needs to secure 361 votes from Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).
Shift in Policy Focus:
The composition of the new Commission will significantly influence EU policy directions. If von der Leyen allies with the Greens, there could be an intensification of green policies and environmental initiatives, such as the European Green Deal.
Leadership and Foreign Policy Changes:
The departure of EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell opens the field for new candidates vying to lead the European External Action Service (EEAS). The new leadership could reshape the EU’s foreign policy approach, with potential changes in emphasis on development cooperation and international relations, including those with Southeast Asia. This could affect ongoing initiatives like the Just Energy Transition partnerships with countries like Vietnam and Indonesia.
Strategic Partnership and Economic Interests:
Southeast Asia is an increasingly important economic partner for the EU. The region’s growing markets and economic dynamism offer significant trade opportunities. For instance, the EU is negotiating free trade agreements with countries like Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, which could enhance trade flows and economic cooperation. Strengthening ties with Southeast Asia helps the EU diversify its trade partners and reduce reliance on traditional markets.
Environmental and Green Transition Initiatives:
Southeast Asia is a crucial region for the EU’s global environmental goals. The EU has invested in green transition initiatives, such as the Just Energy Transition schemes in Vietnam and Indonesia, providing over €20 billion in concessional loans and investments. These initiatives support Southeast Asian countries in adopting sustainable energy practices and combating climate change.
Geopolitical and Security Considerations:
Southeast Asia’s strategic location and geopolitical significance make it a vital region for the EU’s foreign policy. By engaging more deeply with Southeast Asia, the EU can strengthen its influence in a region where other major powers, such as China and the United States, are also vying for influence.
Conclusion:
The EU’s evolving policies and leadership will shape its economic, environmental, and geopolitical engagement with Southeast Asia, highlighting the region’s strategic importance and potential for cooperation.

Investing in preventive healthcare can alleviate the burden on healthcare systems by reducing the prevalence and severity of diseases. By preventing illnesses before they occur or progress, fewer resources are needed for acute care, hospitalizations, and long-term management of chronic conditions.
Accessing ‘Vulnerable Period’
Postpartum Period:
The postpartum period, typically defined as the first six weeks after childbirth, is a critical vulnerable period for women. During this time, the body undergoes significant physiological changes, including hormonal fluctuations and potential immune system alterations. These changes can increase susceptibility to infections and other health complications, necessitating close monitoring and appropriate medical interventions.
Menopausal Transition:
Menopause marks a significant transition in a woman’s life when reproductive hormone levels decline, leading to various physical and psychological changes. This period can be accompanied by symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, and changes in bone density. Due to these changes, women may be more vulnerable to conditions like osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.
Chronic Illness Management:
Women with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or autoimmune disorders may experience periods of vulnerability related to their specific health challenges. Fluctuations in hormone levels, stress, and lifestyle factors can exacerbate these conditions or increase the risk of complications. Healthcare strategies during these vulnerable periods often include personalized treatment plans, regular monitoring, and patient education to optimize disease management and promote overall well-being.
Conclusion:
FOGSI’s launch of a women’s immunization schedule underscores their commitment to advancing women’s health through proactive care, addressing vulnerable periods like postpartum and menopause, and promoting disease prevention and management strategies.
Mains PYQ:
In order to enhance the prospects of social development, sound and adequate health care policies are needed particularly in the fields of geriatric and maternal health care. Discuss.

Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
NEET, NTA
Mains level:
The National Testing Agency responds to the various charges against the conduct of the exams.
Why in the news?
On June 13, the Union government informed the Supreme Court that the scorecards of 1,563 candidates who received compensatory marks in the NEET-UG 2024 exam, held on May 5, will be cancelled.
About National Testing Agency:
National Testing Agency (NTA) has been established as
a premier, specialist, autonomous and self-sustained testing organization
to conduct entrance examinations for admission/fellowship in higher educational institutions.
The NTA was established in
2017
by the
Ministry of Education.
NTA is responsible for conducting the
Joint Entrance Examination – Main (JEE Main)
National Eligibility cum Entrance Test-Undergraduate (NEET-UG)
National Eligibility Test (NET)
Common Management Admission Test (CMAT)
Graduate Pharmacy Aptitude Test (GPAT).
The NTA is chaired by an eminent educationist who will be appointed by the Ministry of Education.
Why has the Union government told the Supreme Court that it will cancel the scorecards of candidates who have been awarded grace marks?
Technical Issues During Exam:
The cancellation stems from petitions challenging the award of grace marks to 1,563 candidates from six NEET centers due to technical issues that did not allow them the full 3.2 hours to complete the exam.
Compensatory Marks Controversy:
Grace marks were awarded based on a court order and the recommendation of a committee constituted by the National Testing Agency (NTA). This move was challenged as arbitrary and lacking transparency.
Skewed Results:
The committee found that the compensatory marks led to a skewed situation, thus recommending the cancellation of the scorecards for these candidates and conducting a re-test on June 23.
How did the National Testing Agency respond to the various charges against the conduct of the exams?
Formation of Committee:
In response to the allegations, the NTA constituted a four-member committee to investigate the truth behind the claims, including the award of grace marks and other issues related to the conduct of NEET 2024.
Admission of Irregularities:
The NTA admitted that the grace marks caused confusion and contributed to skewed results. They acknowledged technical issues and the improper awarding of grace marks.
Panel Recommendations:
The panel recommended limiting grace marks to the attempted questions and concluded that it would be best to cancel the test for the affected 1,563 students.
Explanations for High Scores:
NTA officials attributed the unusually high number of perfect scores (67 students scoring 720/720) to an ‘easy paper’, but still took steps to address the fairness and validity of the results by planning a re-test.
Addressing Other Allegations:
The NTA’s response included acknowledging various logistical issues such as slow distribution of question papers, wrong OMR sheets, and technical delays, and they aimed to ensure better planning and execution in future exams.
Way forward:
Calls for a Re-test for All Candidates:
Students and education experts argue that if the exam can be cancelled for 1,563 candidates, it should be cancelled for all 23 lakh candidates to maintain fairness. They believe that the logical step is to conduct a re-test for everyone who took the May 5 exam.
Restoring Faith in the System:
The dissatisfaction expressed on social media highlights a loss of faith in the examination system. To restore confidence, students demand comprehensive measures to address the flaws and ensure a fair and transparent testing process for all candidates.
Improving Examination Conduct:
For an exam of NEET’s scale and history, it is expected that organizational issues should be resolved. The NTA and government agencies need to enhance measures to prevent fraud, ensure the timely distribution of materials, and apply proper judgment to address any technical issues during the exam, aiming for a smooth and reliable process in future examinations.
Mains PYQ:
National Education Policy 2020 is in conformity with the Sustainable Development Goal-4 (2030). It intends to restructure and reorient the education system in India. Critically examine the statement.

**********Longitude Prize on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Longitude Prize, AMR
Why in the News?
Sysmex Astrego, a Sweden-based diagnostic company, won the £10 million Longitude Prize for developing a
high-tech UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) test
called the
PA-100 AST System.
What is Antimicrobial Resistance?
Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) occurs when
bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites
change so that
medicines no longer work
against them.
This makes infections harder to treat and can lead to
more severe illness
and even death.
AMR can
occur naturally through genetic changes
or when one type of microorganism picks up resistance from another.
It can also occur randomly due to mutations or when
resistant genes spread
between different organisms.
The main reasons for AMR are antibiotics
incorrectly or too often, not having access to clean water and good hygiene, not doing enough to prevent infections, and people not knowing how to use antibiotics properly.
Global Impact of AMR
Global Threat:
Antibiotic-resistant infections caused nearly 1.3 million deaths in 2019, with projections to exceed cancer-related deaths by 2050.
Economic Impact:
The global economy faces potential losses of up to 4 trillion by 2030 and 100 trillion by 2050 due to the AMR crisis.
About the Longitude Prize
The Longitude Prize, valued at
£8 million (₹85 crore)
, was recently awarded for its profound implications in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
The prize
launched in 2014
, aims to revolutionize infection management globally.
Historical Context:
Origins:
Established in 1714 to solve the maritime longitude problem, demonstrating the critical need for accurate navigation.
Modern Application:
The 21st-century Longitude Prize addresses pressing global challenges like AMR, incentivizing innovative solutions.
Goal of the Prize:
Aims to replace current lab-based diagnostic methods with rapid tests that guide targeted antibiotic therapies, combating AMR effectively.
About PA-100 AST System
Technology Breakthrough:
Developed by Sysmex Astrego, this system uses a phenotypic test that identifies UTI bacteria and performs antibiotic susceptibility testing in under 45 minutes.
Operation:
A single-use cartridge processes less than half a milliliter of urine, using microfluidic traps and phase-contrast imaging in a shoe box-sized reader instrument.
Clinical Impact:
Provides rapid “sensitive” or “resistant” results for antibiotics, aiding doctors in immediate, accurate treatment decisions at the point of care.
Current Challenges in UTI Diagnosis
Limited Accuracy:
Current options include urine dipstick tests for quick results but limited accuracy (50-60%) and lab cultures with 2-3 day turnaround times.
Impact on Treatment:
Delayed diagnosis often leads to empirical antibiotic use, contributing to antibiotic resistance worldwide.
Significance for India
Healthcare Burden:
In India, millions seek treatment for UTIs annually, impacting lives and healthcare systems significantly.
Potential:
Rapid, accurate point-of-care tests could revolutionize UTI management globally, saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.
