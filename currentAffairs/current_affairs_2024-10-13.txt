What is Aurora Borealis?
The night sky was illuminated recently by the northern lights, or aurora borealis, visible in parts of the world including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and even Hanle village in Ladakh.
What are Auroras?
An aurora is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic).
Auroras are caused by the interaction of energetic particles (electrons and protons) of the solar wind with atoms of the upper atmosphere.
Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.
They are also commonly known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis).
What is the Aurora Borealis?
Often called the Northern Lights, it occurs in the northern hemisphere, predominantly in regions near the Arctic Circle.
This includes countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada, and Alaska.
The northern lights result from charged particles from the sun, mainly electrons and protons, colliding with the Earth’s magnetosphere and interacting with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere.
These collisions produce colourful displays of light, primarily in green, red and purple hues.
The bright colors of the northern lights are dictated by the chemical composition of Earth's atmosphere.

**********What is United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)?
Israeli forces launched an attack on the headquarters of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) in southern Lebanon recently.
About United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL):
UNIFIL is a peacekeeping force in Lebanon, originally set up by the UN Security Council in March 1978 after Israel first invaded Lebanon in what became known as the South Lebanon Conflict.
UNIFIL was established to oversee the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and to restore peace and security in the area.
After a 34-day war in Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, in which 1,100 Lebanese people were killed, UNIFIL’s mandate was expanded to monitor the cessation of hostilities and support Lebanese armed forces deployed throughout southern Lebanon.
It has around 10,500 peacekeepers coming from 48 troop-contributing countries.
The largest number of UNIFIL peacekeepers come from Indonesia. Italy, India, Nepal and China also contribute a large number of soldiers to the peacekeeping force.
Funding: UNIFIL is funded through a separate account approved on an annual basis by the General Assembly.
It is a part of the UN Peacekeeping force.
UNIFIL’s rules of engagement allow the use of force only if necessary for self-defense or to carry out its duties.

**********Key Facts about Godavari River
The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has planned to outsource 60 sanitary workers through a private agency to clean the Godavari River and its tributaries.
About Godavari River:
It is India's second-longest river after the Ganga and the third-largest in India drains about 10% of India's total geographical area.
It is also called `Dakshina Ganga`, which translates into the South Ganges River.
Course:
The origin of the Godavari River is in Brahmagiri Mountain at Trimbakeshwar in the Nashik district of Maharashtra.
It runs for a length of about 1,465 kilometers.
It finally empties itself into the Bay of Bengal at Narasapuram in West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh.
The river mainstem travels through three states: Maharashtra, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh, while its basin includes Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, parts of Chhattisgarh and Odisha.
It has a drainage basin of some 121,000 square miles (313,000 square km).
The basin is bounded by the Satmala hills, the Ajanta range, and the Mahadeo hills on the north, by the Eastern Ghats on the south and the east, and by the Western Ghats on the west.
The Godavari basin receives its maximum rainfall during the Southwest monsoon.
Tributaries: The principal tributaries of the river are the Pravara, the Purna, the Manjra, the Penganga, the Wardha, the Wainganga, the Pranhita (combined flow of Wainganga, Penganga, Wardha), the Indravati, the Maner, and the Sabri.

**********Shale Gas
A recent study by scientists from Birbal Sahni Institution of Palaeosciences, Lucknow (BSIP) indicated significant shale gas generation potential in the eastern South Karanpura coalfield in the Ramgarh district of Jharkhand.
About Shale Gas:
Shale gas is natural gas found in shale deposits, where it is trapped in microscopic or submicroscopic pores.
This natural gas is a mixture of naturally occurring hydrocarbon gases produced from the decomposition of organic matter (plant and animal remains).
Typically, shale gas consists of 70 to 90 per cent methane (CH4), the main hydrocarbon target for exploration companies.
How is it extracted?
It is extracted by a commonly known method called Hydraulic fracturing.
In this method deep holes are drilled down into the shale rock, followed by horizontal drilling to access more of the gas, as shale reserves are typically distributed horizontally rather than vertically.
Fracking fluids containing sand, water and chemicals are then pumped at high pressure into the drilled holes to open up fractures in the rock, enabling the trapped gas to flow into collection wells. From there it is piped away for commercial use.
India holds promising reserves of Shale Gas & Oil resources and the following sedimentary basins are considered prospective from a Shale oil and gas point of view:
Cambay Basin, Gondwana Basin, KG Basin, Cauvery Basin, Indo-Gangetic Basin and Assam & Assam-Arakan Basin
Applications: This is the gas used for generating electricity and for domestic heating and cooking.

About Water Chestnut:
It is known as goer in Kashmir, an aquatic vegetable growing in the Wular Lake in Kashmir.
It is popularly known as Singhara ka atta in India, it grows underwater.
The plants have extremely sharp spines with barbs that can cause serious injuries if stepped upon.
It is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa and is also known as water caltrops.
It is dense with potassium and fiber. It barely contains any sodium or fat, but is high in carbohydrates.
How it is used?
The edible kernel, concealed beneath a thick outer layer, is peeled off, dried, and pounded into flour.
People also use the sturdy dried outer shells as fuel in the traditional fire pots known as kangri during winter.
Water chestnut is eaten in dishes during during Navaratri. It is also easily digestible and provide energy, which is crucial when fasting.
When peeled, the chestnut reveals white flesh with a crunchy, juicy texture and a sweet taste.
Over the years, dry weather and increasing marshy land around the lake caused a decline in production of water chestnuts and have adversely affected livelihoods.

**********Synthetic Medical Images
The rise of AI-generated synthetic medical images can provide an ethical, scalable, and cost-effective solution to the medical field.
About Synthetic Medical Image:
It is generated by AI or computer algorithms without being captured by traditional imaging devices such as MRI, CT scans, or X-rays.
These images are entirely constructed using mathematical models or AI techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and autoencoders.
In the medical field, synthetic medical images are created in a similar way, where the AI generates entirely new medical scans or radiological images that mimic real ones but are not derived from any actual patient data.
How are these images created?
A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) takes an image, compresses it into a simpler form called the latent space, and then tries to recreate the original image from that compressed version.
The process continuously improves the image by minimising the difference between the real image and the recreated version.
GANs involve a generator that creates synthetic images from random data and a discriminator that determines whether the image is real or synthetic.
Both improve through competition—the generator tries to make its images more realistic, while the discriminator gets better at spotting fakes.
Diffusion models begin with a bunch of random noise and gradually transform it into a realistic image, using a step-by-step process that slowly shapes the noise into something that resembles the images it was trained on.
These methods generate synthetic images in various fields, including healthcare and research.
Advantages
Ability to facilitate intra- and inter-modality translation.
Intramodality translation: It refers to generating synthetic images within the same type of imaging modality, such as improving or reconstructing MRI scans based on other MRI data.
Inter-modality translation: It involves generating synthetic images by translating between different types of imaging modalities, such as creating CT scans from MRI data.
Privacy protection: These images are generated without patient data, they circumvent privacy concerns, making it easier for researchers and healthcare providers to share and collaborate on AI development without the risk of violating patient confidentiality.
Cost effective: Synthetic medical images also address the time and cost of collecting real medical data.

**********Call for Review of the India-ASEAN Trade Deal
Why in news?
A review of the India-ASEAN trade deal by 2025 is included in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 10-point plan at the 21st ASEAN-India Summit. This review stems from concerns over the growing trade imbalance favoring ASEAN and increased Chinese investments in the region.
What’s in today’s article?
Demand to review the trade deal
Current Status of the Trade Deal Review
India-ASEAN free trade deal(AIFTA)
About
AIFTA is a free trade agreement between India and the ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
It aimed to enhance economic cooperation by offering tariff concessions on goods traded between India and ASEAN countries.
It eliminates tariffs on 75% of goods traded between the two regions, and commits parties to reduce tariffs on an additional 10% of product lines to below 5%.
The AIFTA promotes economic cooperation in sectors such as:
Agriculture, fisheries, and forestry; Services; Mining and energy; Science and technology; Transport and infrastructure; Manufacturing.
Agreements
The AIFTA includes:
The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods (AITIG) Agreement, signed in 2009 and entered into force in 2010
The ASEAN-India Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation, signed in 2003
The India-ASEAN Agreement on Services and Investment, signed in 2014 and implemented in 2015
Performance
ASEAN remains a crucial trading partner for India, accounting for 11% of its global trade, with bilateral trade reaching US$ 122.67 billion during 2023-24.
India’s trade with ASEAN experienced astounding growth after signing the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA).
However, the trade disproportionately benefits the ASEAN region.
Between FY 2009 and FY 2023, imports from ASEAN to India grew by 234.4% while exports from India rose only by 130.4%.
As a result, India’s trade deficit expanded from US$ 7.5 billion annually when the agreement was enacted in 2011 to approximately US$ 44 billion in 2023.
Why is India asking for a review of the India-ASEAN trade deal?
Current agreement is not balanced
India wants to review the AIFTA because it believes the current agreement is not balanced.
This deal is leading to a trade deficit due to issues like:
non-reciprocal concessions,
non-tariff barriers, and
concerns about rules of origin exploitation, which allows other countries, particularly China, to
route exports to India through ASEAN nations
, undermining domestic manufacturing in India.
India as a global manufacturing hub
The potential adjustment of tariffs is influenced by the need to protect burgeoning sectors within India's economy, aligning with the government's “Make in India” initiative to transform India into a global manufacturing hub.
For instance, raising tariffs on mobile phone parts and automobile components could incentivize domestic production and reduce import dependency.
Asymmetry in negotiation power
In the goods trade category, India eliminated import duties on approximately 74 percent of tariff lines and reduced duties on an additional 14 percent of tariff lines—highlighting one consolidated offer to ASEAN.
At the same time, each ASEAN member made separate offers to India.
This asymmetry in negotiation power also hinders India’s flexibility in protecting vulnerable domestic industries from competitive ASEAN imports.
The tariff preferences enjoyed by ASEAN countries in the Indian market under the AITIGA have been much greater than those Indian companies receive in ASEAN markets.
Rerouting concerns
The rising influx of Chinese investments and goods into ASEAN has sparked concerns over the rerouting of Chinese products into India through the region.
In response, India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry launched an anti-dumping investigation into steel imports from Vietnam.
The Economic Survey highlighted that
Chinese firms are increasingly rerouting supply chains through countries like Mexico and Vietnam
Need for modernization
The AIFTA is considered outdated and needs to be updated to reflect current market dynamics.
The two sides agreed to initiate a review during the 16th ASEAN-India Economic Ministers Meeting (AIEMM) in September 2019.
However, it took three years to barely agree on the scope of the review at the 19th AIEMM in September 2022.

**********India has eliminated Trachoma as a public health problem
Why in news?
World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared that the Government of India has eliminated Trachoma as a public health problem. With this, India has become the third country in the South-East Asia Region to achieve this milestone.
What’s in today’s article?
Why was trachoma such a challenge in India?
How did Indian govt address the issue of Trachoma?
What does WHO declaring India trachoma-free mean?
About
is the leading infectious cause of blindness globally.
It caused by
Chlamydia trachomatis
, and is spread by direct or indirect contact with eye or nose discharges, especially in young children.
In endemic areas, up to 90% of preschool-aged children can be affected, with infection declining with age.
Symptoms
Repeated infections over time can lead to scarring inside the eyelid, causing the eyelashes to rub against the eye (trachomatous trichiasis), which leads to pain, corneal scarring, and ultimately blindness.
Women are at higher risk due to frequent contact with infected children.
Transmission factors and prevalence
Transmission factors include inadequate hygiene, crowded living conditions, and limited access to clean water and sanitation.
WHO has termed Trachoma as a
neglected tropical disease
WHO estimates suggest that 150 million people worldwide are affected by Trachoma and 6 million of them are blind or at risk of visually disabling complications.
It remains prevalent in rural areas of Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and the Middle East, with Africa being the worst affected.
Efforts to eliminate trachoma
Global efforts to eliminate trachoma are driven by WHO’s SAFE strategy, which includes:
Surgery for trichiasis,
Antibiotics like azithromycin for mass treatment,
Facial cleanliness, and
Environmental improvements, such as better water and sanitation access.
WHO adopted the SAFE strategy in 1993 and launched the WHO Alliance for Global Elimination of Trachoma in 1996
The World Health Assembly has
set 2030 as the new target date for eliminating trachoma as a public health issue globally
By October 2024, 20 countries had eliminated trachoma as a public health problem.
Economic losses from blindness and visual impairment due to trachoma are estimated at $2.9–5.3 billion annually.
High Prevalence in Specific States
Trachoma posed a significant challenge in India as it frequently resurfaced in new communities.
It was a leading cause of blindness in hyper-endemic regions like Punjab, Rajasthan, Western Uttar Pradesh, and Garhwal (Uttarakhand) between 1971 and 1974, where the prevalence exceeded 50%.
These areas were heavily impacted by the disease, making control efforts difficult.
Reduction in Trachoma Prevalence
By 2005, trachoma accounted for only 4% of blindness cases in India.
A survey conducted in 2006-2007 indicated a significant decline in prevalence, prompting the Indian government to conduct a rapid assessment in hyper-endemic states.
Trachoma was amongst the leading cause of blindness in the country during 1950-60.
The Government of India launched the
National Trachoma Control Program in 1963
and later on Trachoma control efforts were integrated into India’s
National Program for Control of Blindness (NPCB)
In 1971, blindness due to Trachoma was 5% and today, owing to the various interventions under the
National Programme for Control of Blindness & Visual Impairment (NPCBVI)
, it has come down to less than 1%.
WHO SAFE strategy
was implemented throughout the country wherein SAFE stands for adoption of surgery, antibiotics, facial hygiene, environmental cleanliness etc.
As a result, in 2017, India was declared free from infective Trachoma
However, surveillance continued for trachoma cases in all the districts of India from 2019 onwards till 2024.
Programs like
Swachh Bharat Mission and Jal Jeevan Mission
played a vital role in eradicating the disease and ensuring a trachoma-free future.
Validation and Elimination
The National Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT only) Survey was conducted from 2021 to 2024 across 200 endemic districts as part of the NPCBVI, following WHO's guidelines for trachoma elimination.
The NPCBVI team compiled all findings into a dossier, which was submitted to the WHO for final review.
After years of dedicated efforts, WHO officially declared that India had successfully eliminated trachoma as a public health problem.
WHO declaring India trachoma-free signifies a
major public health achievement, marking an improvement in the country's water, sanitation, and hygiene standards
According to experts, trachoma is often linked to poor sanitation, a common issue in developing countries.
With its elimination, India has reached "gold-tier" public health status, demonstrating significant progress in addressing these challenges and enhancing overall health conditions.

**********How Technology is Reshaping Protein Studies
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction
About Protein (Importance, Protein-Folding Pattern, AlphaFold, Significance, etc.)
Background:
The
2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
was jointly awarded to
David Baker
Demis Hassabis
, and
John Jumper
for their ground-breaking contributions to
protein studies
Their work has significantly advanced our understanding of
protein structure prediction
protein design
Importance of Proteins in Life:
Proteins are fundamental to all known forms of life. They are made up of
amino acids
, with only
20 amino acids
forming all the proteins found in the human body and most life forms.
Proteins have several critical functions, such as:
Structural support
in tissues
Acting as
catalysts
in biochemical reactions
Transporting molecules
across biological membranes
Controlling muscle contraction
, which helps in movement and heartbeat
Cell communication
, enabling cells to perform tasks in harmony
The Protein-Folding Pattern:
Proteins take on different roles based on their
3D structure
, which is determined by the arrangement of their amino acids.
protein-folding problem
refers to the mystery of how proteins know exactly how to fold into their required shape quickly. This problem has puzzled scientists for decades.
1962
, researchers
John Kendrew
Max Perutz
won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for elucidating the first 3D structures of proteins like
hemoglobin
using
X-ray crystallography
1969
, scientists discovered that proteins somehow "know" their correct shape and fold rapidly into that shape, highlighting the complexity of the protein-folding process.
By the late 2010s, scientists had identified the structures of about
170,000 proteins
out of an estimated
200 million
found in nature.
AlphaFold - Revolutionizing Protein Structure Prediction:
One of the most remarkable breakthroughs came from
, co-founder of
DeepMind
, and his colleague
Their innovation,
, is a
deep-learning model
that predicts the 3D structure of proteins with impressive accuracy. Key milestones include:
AlphaFold 1 (2018)
: Capable of predicting protein structures, a significant improvement in protein research.
AlphaFold 2 (2020)
: Achieved accuracy comparable to
, a method traditionally used to determine protein structures.
AlphaFold 3
: Led by Jumper, this iteration can predict not only protein structures but also how proteins interact with other proteins or molecules.
These tools allow scientists to predict the structure of most proteins in hours, drastically accelerating the pace of research.
However, while AlphaFold can predict how a protein will fold, it doesn’t yet explain why a protein prefers a particular structure, leaving interpretation of the data to human scientists.
Real World Applications of Protein Design:
The ability to design proteins has broad implications for various fields, including
medicine
chemistry
Antiviral Nasal Spray for COVID-19 (2022)
: Baker’s team developed proteins using computational methods to target the
spike protein
of the virus, leading to the creation of an antiviral nasal spray for treating COVID-19.
Enzyme Design for Organic Chemistry
: Teams involving Baker have designed new enzymes for important chemical reactions, such as those used to produce
atorvastatin
(a cholesterol-lowering drug) and
vitamin B6
Biosensors
: Recently, scientists have explored protein designs for use as
biosensors
to monitor health metrics, such as
blood glucose levels
in people with diabetes.
Conclusion:
The work of
has brought transformative changes to the study of proteins.
and other computational tools have revolutionized how scientists predict and design protein structures, opening up new possibilities for developing innovative treatments, drugs, and diagnostic tools.
Their contributions to protein science offer a glimpse into the future, where
artificial intelligence
continue to reshape biology and medicine.

**********National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)
Why in News?
The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has raised serious concerns about the state of functioning in madrassas and called for stopping state funding to them unless they comply with the Right to Education Act.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the NCPCR?
Functions and Responsibilities of NCPCR
NCPCR's Recommendations on Madrasas
The NCPCR is an Indian
statutory
body established in
2007
under the Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act 2005. It works under the aegis of the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development (
WCD
).
Its mandate
is to ensure that
all laws, policies, programs
and administrative systems conform to the vision of the rights of the child (age 0 - 18 years) as enunciated in the
Indian Constitution
as well as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
India has acceded to the CRC in
1992
which is an international treaty that makes it incumbent upon the signatory States to take all necessary steps to protect children's rights enumerated in the Convention.
The Commission envisages a
rights-based perspective
, which flows into national-state-local policies and programmes, ensuring -
Well-being of children,
Strong institution-building processes,
Respect for local bodies and decentralisation at the community level and greater social concern in this direction.
Functions and Responsibilities of NCPCR:
Functions:
Examine and review
existing safeguards for the protection of child rights and recommend measures for their effective implementation.
Report annually
and at other intervals to the central government on the effectiveness of these safeguards.
Investigate violations
of child rights and recommend legal proceedings in appropriate cases.
Promote research
in the field of child rights.
Raise awareness
of child rights and available safeguards through various means, such as publications, media, and seminars.
Inspect institutions
where children are detained or reside, including juvenile homes, and recommend remedial action if necessary.
Investigate complaints
and take suo motu notice of issues related to the deprivation and violation of child rights and the non-implementation of laws protecting and developing children.
Responsibilities:
It has been mandated under the
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act 2009
To examine and review the safeguards of the rights provided under the Act and
To recommend measures for its effective implementation.
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act 2012
To monitor the designation of Special Courts by State Governments, and
To monitor the formulation of the guidelines described in the Act.
It has been charged with the monitoring of
Child Care Institutions (CCIs)
under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015.
It was instructed to carry out a
social audit
of the same by the Supreme Court.
NCPCR's Recommendations on Madrasas:
Allegations against madrasas:
While Articles 29 and 30
of the Constitution protects minority rights, children in these (madrasas) schools were deprived of equal access to quality education under the RTE Act.
There are also allegations of the presence of
objectionable content in religious texts and a lack of qualified educators.
Madrasas reportedly
deprive students of essential facilities
and entitlements provided in regular schools, such as uniforms and midday meals.
Key recommendations by NCPCR:
Its recommendations follow a HC ruling deeming the UP Board of Madrasa Education Act unconstitutional,
citing violations of secularism and fundamental rights under Article 14 of the Constitution
The NCPCR has written to the chief secretaries of all States and UTs recommending the –
Closure of madrasa boards
as they lack accountability and transparency in their functioning.
Withdrawal of state funding
to madrasas unless they comply with the RTE
NCPCR has (in its report titled 'Guardians of Faith or Oppressors of Rights?') recommended –
Removing non-Muslim children from madrassas
As their inclusion violates
Article 28 of the Constitution
, which prohibits the imposition of religious instruction without parental consent.
Political reaction to the NCPCR’s recommendations:
Some opposition parties argue that the recommendations appear politically motivated and risk fostering societal division.
Way Ahead:
The NCPCR's recommendations and the subsequent political discourse underscore a critical intersection of education, minority rights, and governance in India.
As the debate unfolds, stakeholders emphasise the need for
a balanced approach to ensure quality education for all children while respecting diverse cultural contexts.
To ensure this, the NCPCR called for the
coexistence of both the religious and formal education but not within the same institution
