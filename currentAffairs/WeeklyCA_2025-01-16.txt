Bhashini Revolutionises Mahakumbh Experience
January 15, 2025
The
festival in Prayagraj, scheduled from 13 January to 26 February 2025, marks spiritual gathering. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has introduced the Bhashini platform to enhance communication for millions of attendees. This initiative offers real-time translation and voice-enabled assistance in 11 languages, ensuring that all visitors can engage meaningfully.
Multilingual Accessibility
Bhashini provides multilingual support, allowing visitors to communicate in their native languages. Attendees can register lost or found items through kiosks or mobile applications. This feature aims to streamline the experience for everyone, particularly those who may not be fluent in Hindi or English.
Digital Lost & Found Solution
A key highlight of the Bhashini platform is the Digital Lost & Found Solution. This feature enables users to report lost items or register found belongings using voice-based registration. The system supports real-time text and voice translation, facilitating effective communication among attendees and staff.
Kumbh Sah’AI’yak Chatbot
The Kumbh Sah’AI’yak chatbot, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, employs advanced AI technologies, including Llama LLM. This voice-enabled chatbot assists attendees with navigation and information in multiple languages. By catering to diverse linguistic needs, it enhances the overall experience for pilgrims.
Emergency Helpline Integration
The UP 112 emergency helpline has integrated the Bhashini platform to address language barriers. The ‘CONVERSE’ feature allows seamless communication between devotees and police officers. This ensures that grievances are understood and resolved efficiently, promoting safety and support during the event.
Technological Commitment
MeitY’s incorporation of Bhashini at Mahakumbh 2025 demonstrates a commitment to technological innovation. The platform aims to enhance inclusivity and accessibility for both domestic and international visitors. By breaking down language barriers, Bhashini enriches the spiritual journey for all attendees.
Future of Digital Inclusion
Bhashini’s implementation aligns with the vision of
Digital India
. The platform aims to empower citizens by connecting them to digital initiatives in their own languages. This initiative encourages participation from startups and promotes a digital government ecosystem, encouraging collaboration among various stakeholders.
