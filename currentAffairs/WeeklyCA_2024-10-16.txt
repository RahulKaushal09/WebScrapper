About Sati:
Sati refers to the practice of a

memorial stone
and often a
shrine
was erected for her and she was worshipped as a
Goddess.
The first
epigraphical evidence
of Sati has been found from the
Eran Pillar Inscription of
Bhanugupta
Madhya Pradesh in
Eran in 510 AD.
Steps Taken to Abolish Sati:
Mughal Empire:

, emperor
Akbar
ordered his officials throughout the empire to
stop the immolation
of a woman if they saw that she was being forced.

pension, gift and rehabilitation

condemned
the practice in the 15th–16th centuries.

Sati in their colonies in India.

illegal and punishable
by criminal courts under the
Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829.
Other Legal Initiatives to Ameliorate Women’s Position:
Female Infanticide:
Bengal regulations of 1795 and 1804

required parents to register
all births and mandated verification of female infants
for several years in areas where infanticide was secretly practised.

Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act, 1856

and recognised children from such marriages as legitimate.

Age of Consent Act, 1891
forbade the marriage of girls below the age of 12.
Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 (Sarda Act, 1929)

, respectively.

15 to 18 years and for boys from 18 to 21.
Education of Women: Calcutta Female Juvenile Society 1819

Bethune School 1849
became a pivotal institution for women’s education.
What are the Other Reforms Undertaken by William Bentinck (1828-1835)?
Administrative Reforms:
Indianisation of Administration
: Bentinck reversed Cornwallis's policy of excluding Indians from administrative roles by
appointing educated Indians as Deputy Magistrates and Deputy Collectors
, marking a significant move towards Indianising the government service.
Land Revenue Settlement
Lord William Bentinck
reviewed and updated
Mahalwari system
of land revenue in
1833
. It involved detailed surveys and
negotiations with large landholders and village communities,
leading to increased revenue for the state.
Administrative Divisions
: Bentinck reorganised the
Presidency of Bengal
into twenty divisions
, each overseen by a commissioner which enhanced administrative efficiency.
Judicial Reforms:
Abolition of Provincial Courts:
Bentinck abolished
provincial courts
and established a new hierarchy of courts to expedite judicial processes, including the establishment of a
Supreme Court
in Agra
for civil and criminal appeals.
Judicial Empowerment
: He created separate
Sadar Diwani Adalat and Sadr Nizamat Adalat at Allahabad
, improving judicial accessibility for the public.
Reduction of Punishments
: Bentinck reduced the severity of punishments and
abolished inhumane practices
, such as flogging.
Language of the Courts
: Bentinck ordered the use of
vernacular languages
in local courts.
In higher courts, Persian was replaced by
English
, and qualified Indians were appointed as
Munsiffs and Sadar Amins.
Financial Reforms:
Cost-Cutting Measures
: Bentinck formed two committees,
military and civil,
to examine rising expenditures. Following their recommendations, he significantly
reduced the salaries and allowances
of officials and cut travel expenses, leading to substantial annual savings.
Revenue Recovery
: He investigated land grants in Bengal, where many rent-free landholders were found to possess forged title deeds and enhanced the company's revenue.
Educational Reforms:
Influenced by
Macaulay
, Bentinck supported
English as the medium of instruction.
language was
replaced by English
as the official language for the government of India in
English Education Act, 1835.
Social Reforms:
Suppression of Thuggee:
He took decisive action against the
Thuggee system
, a criminal organisation that engaged in robbery and murder.
By the end of
1834
, Bentinck had successfully suppressed this practice, alleviating the fears of the populace.
Support from Reformers
: His reforms were supported by notable figures like
Raja Rammohan Roy
who actively campaigned for the abolition of Sati and advocated for social reform in India.
Conclusion
To further advance social reform in India, it is crucial to continue
raising awareness
about women's rights and education,
enforce existing laws against practices like Sati
, and foster community engagement. Collaborating with grassroots organisations can enhance advocacy efforts, ensuring lasting change and empowerment for marginalised groups in society.
Drishti Mains Question:
Discuss the role of Raja Rammohan Roy in the abolition of Sati. How did various rulers and colonial powers respond to this practice?
