Who is a D-Voter?
The Assam Chief Minister recently announced that nearly 1.2 lakh people in the state have been identified as 'D' (Dubious or Doubtful) voters, with 41,583 declared as foreigners.
About D-Voter:
The concept of
D-Voter is unique to Assam,
where migration and citizenship are among the biggest political fault lines.
It was
introduced in Assam in 1997 by the Election Commission
, targeting those who could not prove their Indian nationality.
Those
persons whose citizenship was doubtful
or was under dispute were categorized as ‘D- Voters’ during the preparation of the National Register of Citizens in Assam.
‘Doubtful voter’ or ‘doubtful citizenship’ have
not been defined in the Citizenship Act, 1955, or the Citizenship Rules of 2003.
The Citizenship Rules, 2003, was framed under the provisions of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003.
The rules framed in 2003
list out the steps to be followed
for the preparation of the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC).
Under subsection 4 of section 4 that deals with the preparation of NRIC, it has been only mentioned that details of individuals whose citizenship is doubtful will be
entered by the Local Registrar
with ‘appropriate remark
in the population register for further enquiry’.
A family or individual is notified in a specific pro forma as soon as the verification process concludes whether they have been classified as a dubious citizen (D-Category).
Before deciding whether or not to add their name to the register, they are also
given the opportunity to be heard by the Taluk
, or Sub-district Registrar of Citizenship. The Registrar has ninety days to complete and justify his findings.
Because their Indian citizenship has not been verified, doubtful voters are
not allowed to vote in elections.
They are also
not permitted to run for office
in the nation's elections.
The marking as doubtful voter is a
temporary measure and cannot be prolonged
. A decision in a definite period of time must be taken.
According to the documentation provided, if it is determined that the individual is a foreign national or an illegal immigrant, they
may be deported or placed
n a detention centre.
D- Voters also have the
option to apply and get their names included in NRC
They will be
included only after they get clearance from the Foreigners
Tribunals and their names are removed from electoral rolls under the ‘D’ category.

**********What is SHe-Box (Sexual Harassment e-box) Portal?
Union Ministry of Women and Child Development recently launched the new SHe-Box portal.
About SHe-Box Portal:
It is a centralized platform for
registering and monitoring complaints of sexual harassment of women in the workplace
It serves as a centralized
repository of information related to Internal Committees (ICs)
and Local Committees (LCs)
formed across the country, encompassing both the government and private sectors.
It offers a common platform to
file complaints
track their status,
ensure time-bound processing
of complaints by ICs.
It provides
assured redressal of complaints
and a streamlined process for all stakeholders.
The portal will also enable
real-time monitoring of complaints
through a designated nodal officer.
The portal will ensure that complaints can be safely r
egistered without personal information being publicly accessible.
The SHe-Box portal can be accessed at
https://shebox.wcd.gov.in/

**********What is Bonus Issue?
Reliance Industries Chairman recently announced a bonus issue for the company’s shareholders in a 1:1 criterion.
About Bonus Issue:
A bonus issue, also known as a
scrip issue
or a
capitalization issue,
occurs when a
listed on a stock exchange decides to offer
free additional shares to
the existing shareholders
The
company decides
the number of bonus shares to be allotted to every individual investor for
holding
a certain number of shares
over a set period of time and
accordingly rewards them
For example, a company may give one bonus share for every five shares held.
This bonus issue aims to
attract further investment
and reward its existing shareholders as it improves the entity's market image.
A bonus issue of shares will
increase a company's share capital but not its market capitalisation.
Market capitalisation is calculated by multiplying the company's current stock price and the total number of outstanding shares. Share capital is the amount that the company raises by issuing shares.
By issuing bonus shares, the number of outstanding shares increases with a proportional decrease in the value of each share, ensuring no change in the market capitalization. However, the
face value of the shares remains unchanged.
They
do not dilute shareholders’ equity
because they are issued in a constant ratio that keeps the relative equity of each shareholder the same as before the issue.
A bonus share issue is
funded by the company's healthy profits
reflected in its annual or quarterly results or from its share reserves.
The issuance of bonus shares is
not taxable
; however, shareholders must still
pay capital gains tax
if they sell them
for a net gain.
What is a Stock Split?
A stock split is an action taken in which a
divides its existing shares into multiple shares
to boost the liquidity of shares.
A split is usually undertaken
when the stock price is high
, making it pricey for investors to acquire.
It
brings down the share price
as the number of shares increases.
The market cap of the firm
and the value of each shareholder’s investment stay unchanged
after a stock split.
Stock Split v/s Bonus Issue:
Most people mistake stock splits for bonus concerns. This is due to the fact that, similar to stock splits, bonus issues can
result in a rise in
company's share count.
In contrast to a stock split, where the face value of each share is decreased, a bonus issue offers existing owners
more shares at no cost
in proportion to the shares they
now possess in the company.
Therefore, bonus shares
raise the company's share capital
while a stock split keeps it constant.
However, in both scenarios, the
number of shares rises
and the share price falls accordingly.

**********India's 2nd nuclear missile submarine
Why in news?
India has got its second nuclear submarine with the commissioning of INS Arighaat into the Navy. INS Arighaat will join its predecessor
INS Arihant
strengthening the country’s nuclear triad — the ability to fire nuclear missiles from platforms in the air, land and sea.
What’s in today’s article?
2nd nuclear missile submarine INS Arighaat
About
INS Arihant, a 6,000-tonne submarine is the lead ship of India's Arihant class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines built under the Advanced Technology Vessel (ATV) project.
Under the Rs 90,000 crore top secret ATV project, India is currently building three more SSBNs to follow INS Arihant.
The second such submarine, INS Arighat commissioned recently.
The vessel will be followed by two 7,000-tonne SSBNs under the ATV project.
There is also plan to build 13,500-tonne SSBNs with more powerful 190MW reactors.
It is India's first indigenous nuclear submarine that has been inducted in the Indian Navy
Launched in 2009, INS Arihant was commissioned in 2016.
Features
Power source
It is propelled by an 83 MW pressurised light-water reactor at its core with enriched uranium fuel.
Builder
Shipbuilding Centre (SBC), Visakhapatnam. It’s India’s first indigenously built nuclear submarine.
Its design is based on the Russian Akula-1 class submarines and its 83mw pressurised water reactor has been built with significant Russian assistance.
It is a ‘Ship Submersible Ballistic Nuclear Submarine’ (SSBN).
SSBN's are that class of submarines which can go deep beneath the ocean making them virtually undetectable for months, they also carry nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
Armament
It is capable of carrying ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads.
It is armed with the K-15 Sagarika missiles with a range of 750 km.
Later, it will also be armed with K-4 missiles, being developed by the DRDO, which are capable of striking targets at a distance of up to 3,500 km.
These 'K' series of missiles are named after former President APJ Abdul Kalam.
Significance
Nuclear triad
With INS Arihant, India completed its ‘nuclear triad’.
i.e., India can launch nuclear missile from all three key defence bastions — land, air and sea.
Triad is important because in an enemy strike, even if the other wings are destroyed, the third can launch a retaliatory strike thus providing a guaranteed ‘second strike’ capability to the country.
Stealth capability
Due to satellites, other legs of our nuclear triad (missile sites and air-bases) remain exposed to enemy attack.
However, being a SSBN, it can stay deep inside the ocean making them virtually undetectable for months.
Part of Elite club
INS Arihant places India in the league of select group of five Countries — US, Russia, France, UK and China — which can design, construct and operate Strategic Strike Nuclear Submarines.
Credible minimum deterrence
:
While India remains committed to the doctrine of Credible Minimum Deterrence and No First Use,” the success of INS Arihant gives a fitting response to those who indulge in Nuclear Blackmail.
Maritime security
INS Arihant will strengthen India’s position in the Indian Ocean region where it has to face challenges from Chinese submarines.
Boost to defence manufacturing
The Arihant is a live manifestation of Government’s Make in India vision.
About the news
India got its second nuclear submarine with the commissioning of INS Arighaat into the Navy, a move that will significantly boost the country’s deterrence capability.
The discreet commissioning ceremony of the Arihant-class vessel in Visakhapatnam was attended by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
The 6,000-tonne nuclear-propelled submarine will be armed with indigenously made K-15 missiles which have a range of over 700 km.
Like INS Arihant, it is powered by 83 MW pressurised light-water reactors which allows it to remain submerged for longer periods when compared to conventional submarines.
The presence of both INS Arihant and INS Arighaat will enhance India’s capability to deter potential adversaries and safeguard its national interests.

**********Piezoelectric Polymer
Researchers from Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences (CeNS), an autonomous institute of Department of Science and Technology, in collaboration with scientists from National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL), Pune have developed a security alert system based on piezoelectric polymer nanocomposite.
About Piezoelectric Polymers:
These are polymers that can
generate electric charges
on the surface under pressure/strain thus converting
mechanical energy
into
electrical energy
Characteristics
These polymers have much
higher piezoelectric stress constants
indicating that they are much better sensors than ceramics.
They have
low dielectric constant
low elastic stiffness
, and low density, which result in a high voltage sensitivity and low acoustic and mechanical impedance (crucial for medical and underwater applications).
Piezoelectric polymeric sensors and actuators offer the advantage of processing flexibility because they are
lightweight, tough, readily manufactured
into large areas, and can be cut and formed into complex shapes.
Polymers also typically possess a high dielectric breakdown and high operating field strength, which means that they can withstand much
higher driving fields than ceramics.

**********Unified Payments Interface (UPI) block mechanism
Recently, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) proposed mandatory Unified Payments Interface (UPI) block mechanism facility for secondary market trading using the UPI-based block mechanism to their clients.
About Unified Payments Interface (UPI) block mechanism:
It is similar to the
Application Supported by Blocked Amount
(ASBA) facility that allows trading with blocked amounts.
In the primary market, the facility ensures that money from an investor gets moved only when the allotment is completed.
In the UPI block mechanism, clients can trade in the
secondary market based
on blocked funds in
their bank accounts
, instead of transferring the funds upfront to the trading member.
The facility is
currently optional for investors
, and not mandatory for Trading Members (TMs) to offer as a service to clients.
Significance:
It provides
enhanced protection
to the client's funds and securities.
Key facts about Application Supported by Blocked Amount
It was first introduced by
SEBI in 2008.
It is a process for making
Initial Public Offerings
(IPOs) or rights issue subscriptions.
It is a facility provided by banks that allows investors to apply for an IPO or rights issue by
blocking the application amount in their bank account
instead of transferring the money to the issuer.
Under ASBA, the investor's application money remains in their bank account, and only a
block is created on the funds
for the IPO application amount.
This blocked amount remains in the investor's bank account
until the allotment process is completed
Once the shares are allotted to the investor, the block is released, and
only the amount for the allotted shares is deducted
from the investor's account.
In public issues and rights issues, all investors have to mandatorily apply through ASBA.

**********Controversy Over Lateral Entry into the Civil Services
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context, Merit vs Spoils System)
Lateral Entry (Purpose, Process, Pros, Cons, Way Forward, etc.)
Larger Issues in Indian Bureaucracy
Background:
Recently, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) withdrew an advertisement for lateral recruitment to 45 government posts.
This decision followed objections raised by political parties and the intervention of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), highlighting concerns about the need for reservation in such recruitments.
Understanding Merit vs. Spoils System:
Merit System:
Introduced in 1858, this system ensures appointments to government posts through a rigorous selection process.
In India, the UPSC conducts exams to select officers for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), and other central services.
The aim is to create a neutral bureaucracy that can provide independent advice to the government.
Originating in the U.S., this system allows the ruling party to appoint its supporters to various government positions.
While this system was largely replaced by the merit system in 1883, it still exists in a limited form, with a
small percentage of senior government posts directly appointed by the President
About Lateral Entry in Civil Services:
Lateral entry in administration is the
appointment of specialists from the private sector in government organisations
It was recommended by the NITI Aayog in its Three-year Action Agenda and also the Group of Secretaries (GoS) on Governance had in its report recommended the induction of personnel in the middle and senior management level in the government.
Objective
Lateral entry was introduced to serve the twin purpose of:
Bringing in
domain expertise
in the civil services,
Addressing the problem of
shortage of IAS officers
at the Centre.
With lateral entry, the government aims to recruit outstanding individuals, with expertise in revenue, financial services, economic affairs, agriculture, cooperation and farmers’ welfare, road transport and highway, civil aviation, commerce among many other sectors to serve for the benefit of the country.
Process of Lateral Entry Recruitment:
The selection process for lateral entry into administration is conducted by the
The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT
asks the UPSC to conduct the selection process for lateral entry to various positions in government departments and ministries.
Subsequently, the UPSC invites online applications for lateral recruitment for these positions.
Once the candidates have submitted their application, the UPSC conducts interviews of the shortlisted candidates and recommends the list of selected candidates to the DoPT.
The recommended candidates are then appointed by the Government,
generally for a period of 3 to 5 years
Need for Lateral Entry:
Shortage of officers:
There is a shortage of 22.48% or 1,510 officers for the IAS cadre, according to the DoPT.
The IAS and the Indian Police Service (IPS) have a combined shortage of 2,418 officers.
Domain Expertise:
Through lateral entry, domain experts can be recruited from the private sector to the central administration.
This can be helpful in improving efficiency and create a competitive environment in governance delivery.
Pros of Lateral Entry in Civil Services:
Expertise and Specialization:
Lateral entry allows professionals with specialized knowledge and experience from the private sector to contribute to policymaking and implementation, enhancing the quality of governance.
Innovation and Fresh Perspectives:
Individuals from diverse backgrounds bring new ideas, innovative approaches, and fresh perspectives, potentially improving efficiency and effectiveness in public administration.
Merit-Based Selection:
Lateral entry emphasizes merit, skills, and experience over traditional seniority, promoting a performance-oriented culture within the civil services.
Shortening Learning Curve:
Experienced professionals can quickly adapt and contribute without requiring extensive training, which is often needed for career bureaucrats.
Cons of Lateral Entry in Civil Services:
Cultural and Bureaucratic Resistance:
The traditional civil services may resist the inclusion of lateral entrants, potentially leading to friction, lack of cooperation, and integration challenges.
Lack of Public Sector Experience:
Lateral entrants may lack understanding of government procedures, protocols, and the complexities of public administration, affecting their effectiveness.
Potential for Bias:
The selection process for lateral entry could be perceived as biased or politically influenced, raising concerns about transparency and fairness.
Short-Term Focus:
Professionals entering laterally may focus on short-term goals rather than long-term public service commitments, potentially affecting the continuity and sustainability of policies.
Way Forward:
To address the concerns associated with lateral entry, certain measures can be taken:
Higher Scrutiny:
Appointments at the secretary level should be carefully monitored to ensure they influence policy decisions positively.
Integration with Public Policy:
Even at operational levels like Joint Secretary, Director, and Deputy Secretary, lateral entrants should be in line with public policy objectives.
Balancing Merit with Social Justice:
Appointments should combine technical competence with considerations for reservation and social justice, as emphasized by political philosopher Michael Sandel.
Larger Issues in Indian Bureaucracy:
Challenges for Career Bureaucrats:
Despite criticisms of
red-tapism
inefficiency
, career bureaucrats operate in a complex environment bound by numerous rules and political interference.
Preserving Autonomy:
The effectiveness of bureaucrats depends on their autonomy, particularly regarding postings, tenures, and transfers.
Strengthening Civil Service Boards at the Centre and State levels
, as recommended by the Supreme Court in the T.S.R. Subramanian case (2013), is crucial.
Conclusion:
While lateral entry brings certain benefits, it should not overshadow the need to address deeper issues within the Indian bureaucracy.
A balanced approach that includes both career bureaucrats and lateral entrants, with a focus on merit, social justice, and autonomy, is essential for effective governance.

**********Incentivising Semiconductor Manufacturing in India
Why in News?
The Indian government, having nearly exhausted the $10 billion subsidy under its ambitious semiconductor manufacturing incentive policy, is planning a second phase with a $15 billion outlay.
This expansion aims to provide capital support for raw materials and gases used in chip manufacturing, while reducing subsidies for assembly and testing plants.
What’s in Today’s Article?
India’s Semiconductor Ambitions
India's Major Leap into Semiconductor Manufacturing
The Semiconductor Manufacturing Incentive Policy
India’s Semiconductor Ambitions:
Background:
In today’s world, semiconductors constitute the
backbone of modern electronics
, indispensably situated at the junction of a wide range of industries.
Given their broad applicability, countries across the globe are strategising to mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a single supply source of semiconductor chips.
This also serves to fortify national security and economic well-being, considering recent geopolitical conflicts.
Advantages to India:
India has 20% of the world’s semiconductor design
workforce
, a rapidly evolving
technology
landscape and a thriving domestic
market
, all of which are conducive in building an indigenous semiconductor ecosystem.
How to sustain the growing momentum?
Pacing up of initiatives:
In the last few decades (prior to the current push), India made multiple attempts to join the global semiconductor industry but fell short primarily due to the lack of proactiveness in policy implementation.
Drawing lessons from the past, the government can ensure swift execution of policies under its freshly formulated strategy.
Inching up the value chain:
To establish an end-to-end semiconductor ecosystem, India can consider strategically moving across the industry value chain.
Leveraging the talent edge:
Estimates say that India will require 1.2 million skilled people in the semiconductor sector by 2032. The clock is ticking, and India must develop its talent ecosystem fast.
India's Major Leap into Semiconductor Manufacturing:
The government is aiming for India to be among the top five global destinations (on the lines of the United States, Taiwan and South Korea) for semiconductor manufacturing by
2030
Government initiatives
, such as the National Electronics Policy or the USD10 billion production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for semiconductor manufacturing, are also boosting India’s chipmaking aspirations.
India has been luring foreign companies to set up operations in the country.
For example
The country has approved a fabrication plant worth $11 billion being set up by Tata Electronics in partnership with Taiwan’s Powerchip.
3 different chip assembly plants are being set up by the Tatas, US-based Micron Technology, and Murugappa Group’s CG Power in partnership with Japan’s Renesas.
Hence, with the right blend of proactive actions, tech skills, infrastructural acceleration and fiscal investments, India has the potential to achieve this target.
The Semiconductor Manufacturing Incentive Policy:
In the first iteration
of the incentive policy released in 2021,
The Centre had offered a 30% capex subsidy for chip packaging and testing plants.
However, the Centre had increased the subsidy for such plants to 50% in 2022.
The Semiconductor Manufacturing Incentive Policy 2.0:
Focus on chip fabrication:
India wants to go up (beyond assembly and packaging facilities) the complexity ladder in the semiconductor ecosystem, where nations like Malaysia already have a stronghold.
Therefore, the new scheme could see an
increased focus on fabrication plants, and more advanced display technologies.
Technology transfer costs:
Under the new incentive scheme, the government
does not want to support
technology transfer costs.
This implies that companies that collaborate with others to use their technology for chip fabrication may have to pay for it themselves.
Capital equipment and ecosystem support:
Under the new scheme, the government could also offer capital equipment and ecosystem support such as gases, chemicals, and raw materials needed at assembly and testing plants.
It could also look at incentivising fabrication of micro-LED displays.

**********The Gender Budget of 2024-25
Why in news?
In the 2024-25 Budget, the Finance Minister emphasized women-led development, highlighting a strong commitment to women's empowerment.
This dedication is evident in the Gender Budget Statement (GBS), which reported that
the Gender Budget has reached 1% of GDP estimates for the first time
. The overall budget allocations for pro-women programs now exceed ₹3 lakh crore, reflecting a significant investment in initiatives aimed at advancing gender equality.
What’s in today’s article?
Gender Budget in India
About
Gender budgeting is a policy strategy that integrates a gender perspective into the budgetary process.
It aims to assess how government spending and resource allocation impact men and women differently.
The goal is to promote gender equality by ensuring that public resources are distributed in a way that benefits all genders equitably.
Basically, Gender Budgeting is a tool for gender mainstreaming, applying a gender lens to the entire policy process.
It involves gender-sensitive formulation, resource allocation, and continuous monitoring to address vulnerabilities faced by women throughout their life cycle.
Need for Gender Budgeting
Despite India's progress in various sectors, significant gender disparities persist in areas such as education, health, employment, and political participation.
Gender budgeting is necessary to address these disparities and to ensure that women's specific needs are considered in policy formulation and implementation.
It also promotes accountability in achieving gender equality goals.
Introduction of Gender Budgeting in India
India introduced gender budgeting in 2005-06.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development spearheaded this initiative, which was supported by the Ministry of Finance.
The Indian government began by identifying and classifying budgetary allocations into three categories:
Part A
: Schemes where 100% of the budget is allocated for women.
Part B
: Schemes where at least 30% of the budget is allocated for women.
Part C:
Schemes that allocate up to 30% of their funds to women
Implementation of Gender Budgeting
Nodal authorities, including the Ministry of Women and Child Development at the central level, spearhead gender budgeting implementation.
Departments of Women and Child Development/ Social Welfare, Finance or Planning Department are also responsible for gender budget implementation in states and Union territories.
The Gender Budget (GB) of 2024-25
The GB reached 1% of GDP estimates in 2024-25 for the first time, and overall allocations currently stand at more than ₹3 lakh crore for pro-women programmes.
Since its introduction in 2005-06, the Gender Budget Statement (GBS) has consistently accounted for an average of 5% of total budgetary allocations, with minor fluctuations.
However,
in 2024-25, the share of allocations to pro-women schemes has risen to approximately 6.8% of the total budget expenditure
Increase driven by two main factors
First, the
introduction of Part ‘C’ in the GBS
, which includes schemes with less than 30% allocation for women.
E.g., the PM Kisan scheme in the agriculture sector, which now reports ₹15,000 crore, or 25% of its total outlay, under this category.
Second, the rise in Part A allocations, which cover schemes with 100% allocation for women.
Previously, Part A constituted 15-17% of GBS allocations, but this has surged to nearly 40% since 2023-24.
This change is largely due to the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) — both rural and urban — being reclassified from Part B to Part A.
Issues of both over-reporting and under-reporting
The GBS for 2024-25 highlights issues of both over-reporting and under-reporting in gender-related allocations.
Over-reporting is evident in schemes like the PM Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), where 40% of the total ₹920 crore allocation was reported without explanation.
Conversely, under-reporting deflates the actual spending on women’s needs.
For instance, the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) is now correctly reflected in Part A of the GBS with 100% allocation for women, which was underreported in previous years.
Additionally, while increased allocations for the Ministry of Electronics & IT have been correctly reported, pro-women allocations in schemes like PM Vishwakarma, SVANidhi, and Stand-Up India were omitted.
In another example, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), despite women constituting 59.3% of all person-days under the scheme,
only has 33.6% of its budget reflected in Part B of the GBS
This discrepancy suggests that the actual benefits to women under MGNREGA are not fully captured in the GBS.
Way forward
To minimize anomalies in the GBS, it is essential to include explanations for budgetary entries.
Providing these rationales would enhance accounting accuracy, facilitate gender audits, and lead to better gender outcomes in government programs.
The recent inclusion of a third part in the GBS reflects years of advocacy by experts for improved reporting.
However, the persistent anomalies indicate that the GBS still lacks a scientific and systematic approach.
While efforts to reduce misreporting and improve the GBS quality are evident, more progress is needed.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
BioE3 Policy;
Mains level:
Significance of BioE3 Policy;
Why in the News?
The Union Cabinet has approved the ‘
BioE3 (Biotechnology for Economy, Environment, and Employment) Policy’
proposed by the
Department of Biotechnology to promote advanced biomanufacturing.
What is the BioE3 Policy?
The BioE3 (Biotechnology for Economy, Environment and Employment) Policy is a strategic initiative approved by the Indian Cabinet to
foster high-performance biomanufacturing.
Aims and Objectives of the Policy:
Innovation Support:
The policy promotes
research and development (R&D)
and entrepreneurship in various thematic sectors, facilitating
technological advancement and commercialization.
Biomanufacturing Hubs:
It proposes the establishment of
Biomanufacturing & Bio-AI hubs and Biofoundries
to enhance India’s bioeconomy.
Focus Areas:
The policy targets several strategic sectors, including high-value bio-based
chemicals, biopolymers, smart proteins, precision biotherapeutics, climate-resilient agriculture, carbon capture,
marine and space research.
Significance of the Policy
Economic Growth:
It is expected to catalyze a “bio revolution” similar to the IT revolution, generating
substantial job opportunities in biotechnology and biosciences.
Sustainability Goals:
The policy aligns with government initiatives for achieving a
‘Net Zero’ carbon economy
promotes sustainable lifestyles
, thereby steering India towards accelerated green growth and a circular bio-economy.
Job Creation:
By expanding the
skilled workforce in biotechnology,
the policy aims to create various kinds of employment opportunities, addressing critical societal issues such as climate
change, food security, and human health.
Present Status of Indian Bio-economy
Growing Potential:
The biotechnology sector is seen as a key player in addressing challenges in
health, agriculture, environment, and energy.
India has a
large pool of young, skilled workers, with 47% of its population
under the age of 25.
Investment in R&D:
Despite its potential, India
spends less than 1% of its GDP on research
, compared to countries like Israel and South Korea, which invest over 4%.
Existing Infrastructure:
The government has established
9 biotech parks and 60 bio-incubators,
which support the growth of the biotechnology sector.
Challenges Ahead
Educational Gaps:
The current educational
curriculum does not adequately prepare students
for industry demands, creating a skills mismatch.
Funding Issues:
There is a
lack of venture capital funding due to information asymmetry regarding the biotech industry,
which hampers innovation and growth.
Clinical Trials:
India conducts a
low percentage of clinical trials compared to global standards,
which is a concern for the development of biopharmaceuticals.
Research Investment:
The government currently covers over
60% of total R&D spending,
which is very different from countries where the
private sector contributes a large portion.
Way forward:
Enhance Industry-Academia Collaboration:
Encourage partnerships between
educational institutions and biotech companies
to align curricula with
industry needs
, thereby reducing the skills mismatch and preparing students for emerging job markets.
Increase Private Sector Investment:
Implement policies and incentives to
attract more private sector investment in R&D,
tax benefits, public-private partnerships, and improved access to venture capital,
to stimulate innovation and reduce reliance on government funding.
**********Moving the spotlight to grassroots democracy  
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
73rd and 74th amendments;
Mains level:
Issue of Disempowerment of State Election Commissions (SECs);
Why in the News?
The Election Commission of India (ECI) has established itself as one of India’s most credible institutions, known for consistently conducting free, fair, and timely elections to Parliament and State legislatures. However, the
34 State Election Commissions (SECs) still require significant attention and strengthening.
The Constitution
(73rd and 74th amendments)
vested SECs with the responsibility of conducting elections to panchayats and urban local governments, but in reality,
SECs are increasingly disempowered by state governments.
Legal and Administrative Challenges:
SECs sometimes find themselves in
litigation with state governments.
For instance, the
Karnataka SEC has had to file contempt petitions against the state government
for failing to fulfill commitments related to the conduct of elections, highlighting a
lack of cooperation from state authorities
Inadequate Empowerment:
Many SECs
do not have the power to conduct delimitation of wards or manage the electoral rolls independently.
This results in
reliance on the Election Commission of India (ECI) and state governments,
which can lead to arbitrary decisions that delay elections.
Only
11 out of 34 states and UTs have empowered SECs to conduct ward delimitation,
accounting for just 35% of India’s population.
Lack of Resources:
SECs are legally entitled to request funds and assistance from state governments, but they often do not receive adequate resources, which hampers their ability to conduct elections effectively.
Public Trust Erosion:
The delays and challenges faced by
SECs undermine public confidence in local governance and electoral processes,
leading to a perception that local elections are not as credible as those conducted by the ECI for national and state elections
Election not on time:
Performance audits by the CAG found that
70% of urban local governments in 18 states did not have elected councils at the time
of the audit due to delays caused by disempowered SECs.
Electoral Reforms Needed to Strengthen the Third Tier
Parity with the Election Commission of India
: SECs should be made as
transparent and independent as the Election Commission of India.
This could be achieved by appointing a
three-member SEC through a committee comprising the Chief Minister, Leader of Opposition, and Chief Justice of the High Court,
rather than by the State government alone.
Fixed Intervals for Delimitation
: The delimitation of ward boundaries and reservations should be conducted at fixed intervals,
such as every 10 years,
prevent arbitrary actions by State governments
Transfer of Powers to SECs
powers of delimitation and reservation of seats
local governments should be vested in the SECs.
SECs should also handle reservations for positions like mayors and presidents to avoid delays caused by State governments.
Conclusion:
Strengthening SECs through these reforms is essential to ensure timely, transparent, and credible local elections, thereby reinforcing grassroots democracy and public trust in local governance.
**********What does Australia’s new cap on a number of international students mean?  
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Indian students in developed countries;
Why in the News?
Australia’s Education Minister announced a plan to establish a
National Planning Level (NPL)
that will cap the number of new international students at 2.7 lakh for the 2025 calendar year, subject to parliamentary approval.
What does the 2025 Cap entail?
Australia plans to introduce a cap on new international students at 2.7 lakh for the calendar year 2025.
Distribution of Seats:
Publicly funded universities:
1.45 lakh students (maintaining 2023 levels).
Vocational education and training (VET) sector:
95,000 new students.
Other universities and non-university providers:
30,000 students.
Certain categories, such as school students, research degree pursuers, students in standalone English language courses, government-sponsored scholars, and students from specific regions (e.g., Asia Pacific), are exempt from the cap.
Trends in Indian Student Enrollment in Australia:
In 2023,
Australia admitted
5.61 lakh international students, in 2022, it saw 3.88 lakhs, in 2021, it had 2.82 lakhs, in 2020, it had 3.96 lakhs, and in 2019, it saw 5.19 lakh students.
2024 Projections:
Between
January and May 2024, the total student commencements reached 2.89 lakh,
with additional intakes expected later in the year, possibly surpassing 2023 levels.
Five-Year Trend:
The 2025 cap will result in the lowest intake in the past five years, considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on previous years’ admissions.
Possible Impacts on Indians Since Last Year:
Enrollment Numbers:
The number of Indian students in Australia saw a decline from
126,487 in 2023 to 118,109 in 2024.
This comes on the back of moves by the Australian government to
curb migration over the past six months, including higher IELTS band score requirements and the Genuine Student Test
for applicants.
Universities, especially the
Group of Eight (Go8) research-intensive universities
, have criticized the capping as a “bad policy” that will adversely impact them.
Rising Costs:
The Australian government increased the visa processing fee from
AUD 710 to AUD 1,600 (approximately Rs 40,524 to Rs 91,321) as of July 1, 2024.
This could
deter prospective applicants
due to financial constraints.
Way Forward:
Increase Scholarships and Financial Aid:
The Australian government and universities should offer more scholarships and financial aid packages to offset the higher costs and attract international students, particularly from India.
Strengthen Bilateral Education Ties:
Enhance collaboration between Australian and Indian educational institutions to create joint programs and exchange opportunities, ensuring a steady flow of students despite the cap.
**********Analyzing the Gender Budget of 2024-25   
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Gender Budget;
Mains level:
Issues related to Gender Budget;
Why in the News?
Women-led development is
central in this year’s Budget
, with
allocations
reaching 1% of GDP
and over
₹3 lakh crore for pro-women programs.
About Gender Budgeting in India:
The
Gender Budget Statement (GBS)
was introduced in the
2005-06 budget.
GBS has consistently represented an average of
5% of total budgetary allocations
since its introduction, with minor fluctuations.
In the 2024-25 budget, the share of allocations to
pro-women schemes
increased to approximately 6.8% of the total budget expenditure.
Different Components of the Gender Budget Statement
The Gender Budget Statement (GBS) is structured into three main parts:
Part A:
This section includes schemes and programs that have
100% allocation specifically for women.
Part B:
This part covers schemes with
more than 30% but less than 100% of their allocations directed towards women.
Part C:
Introduced recently, this section reports
pro-women schemes that have less than 30% provisioning for women.
Instances of Missing Allocations Reported by Experts:
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY):
Initially, only a portion of
PMAY’s budget was reported under Part B
, which led to an
underrepresentation
of its impact on women. The entire allocation of ₹80,670 crore for 2024-25 was later moved to Part A, raising concerns about the accuracy of reporting since
not all beneficiaries are women.
PM Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP):
The GBS reported an allocation of ₹920 crore, which was claimed to be 40% of the total allocation to PMEGP, without a clear rationale for this percentage.
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS):
Although women
constituted 59.3% of all person-days under MGNREGS, only 33.6% of its total outlay was reflected in the GBS,
indicating a significant
underreporting of women’s engagement
and benefits from the scheme.
How should these anomalies be rectified by the Government (Way forward):
Incorporate Explanations:
Providing
clear explanations for the allocations
reported in the GBS would
enhance transparency and accountability.
Audit of Budgetary Allocation:
The government should involve
regular audits and assessments
of how budgetary allocations impact gender equality.
Engage Stakeholders:
Involving
experts and stakeholders in the process of developing the GBS
can provide insights into the specific needs of women and help ensure that the budget effectively addresses those needs.
Mains PYQ:
Women empowerment in India needs gender budgeting. What are requirements and status of gender budgeting in the Indian context?

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Magnetic Anomalies of Mars
Why in the News?
A study conducted by the
Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG)
revealed significant variations in the strength of Mars’ crustal magnetic field between day and night.
Notable facts about Mars:
Mars is the
fourth planet
from the Sun and the
second-smallest
in the Solar System,
larger only than Mercury.
Named after the
Roman god of war
, Mars is often called the “
Red Planet
” due to its reddish appearance from
iron oxide
on its surface.
It is a
terrestrial planet
with a
thin atmosphere
, featuring surface characteristics like impact craters, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps.
Mars shares
similar days and seasons to Earth
because of its comparable rotational period and axial tilt.
It hosts
Olympus Mons
largest volcano and highest mountain
on any planet, and
Valles Marineris
, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System.
NASA recently found water frost over the Olympus Mons
Key Findings on Mars’s Magnetic
is significantly
stronger
during the daytime
and nearly non-existent at night-time.
This suggests a
diurnal variation
in the magnetic field strength on the Martian surface.
The
of Mars is primarily
located in the southern hemisphere
, specifically poleward of 30°S latitude.
The magnetic fields are
scattered within a region between 120° E and 240° E
, indicating uneven distribution across the Martian surface.
daytime crustal magnetic field
plays a crucial role in
controlling the ionosphere in Mars’ southern hemisphere.
This influence impacts communication and navigation systems of future missions.
Data Utilization from MAVEN Satellite
The study utilized data from the
MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) Satellite
, which has been orbiting Mars since 2014.
MAVEN’s data on electron density and magnetic field were critical in investigating how Mars’ crustal magnetic field affects its plasma environment and ionosphere.
Significance of the Study
Understanding Mars’ crustal magnetic field is essential for future robotic and manned missions, as it provides natural magnetic shielding against space radiation.
The insights from the study can help in developing strategies to mitigate the effects of space weather on spacecraft and astronauts.

**********Land-Based Deep Depression causing extreme floods in Gujarat
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Gujarat and parts of Rajasthan are facing
severe flooding caused by a land-based deep depression.
The unusual formation of this deep depression over land was intensified by
moisture influx from soils or the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
What is Land-Based Deep Depression?
A land-based deep depression is a type of
cyclonic system
characterized by a significant
drop in atmospheric pressure leading to sustained wind and significant weather impact.
They
form and intensify over land
, which is relatively
rare
due to the limited availability of moisture.
Characteristics:
It
forms over land
water.
Wind Speed
ranges from 51 to 62 km/h, just below the threshold for a tropical cyclone (62-88 km/h).
Relies on moisture from soil
surrounding
environments rather than oceanic sources.
It often has an
unpredictable path
and can cause significant rainfall and localized flooding.
Implications of Land-Based Deep Depressions
These systems can bring
prolonged and intense rainfall
, leading to widespread flooding, especially in regions unaccustomed to high levels of precipitation.
Heavy rainfall can lead to significant
soil erosion
, affecting agricultural productivity and altering landscapes.
Prolonged flooding can cause
waterlogging
in agricultural fields, leading to soil salinization and reduced fertility.
