How did the Haber-Bosch Process Change the World?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
About Haber-Bosch Process (Concept, Nitrogen & Its Role, Environmental Impact, etc.)
Background:
The
Haber-Bosch process
, developed in the early 20th century, revolutionized global agriculture and food production by enabling the industrial synthesis of
ammonia (NH3)
from atmospheric nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2).
This innovation, which allowed for the mass production of nitrogen-based fertilizers, has had a profound impact on feeding the world’s growing population and supporting modern agriculture.
Understanding Nitrogen and Its Role in Nature:
Nitrogen (N2)
is a critical element for life, as it is a key component of
proteins, enzymes
, and
amino acids
in both plants and animals.
Although nitrogen is abundant in the atmosphere, making up about
78% of the air
, it is mostly present in an inert form (N2) that cannot be directly utilized by plants.
Plants require
reactive nitrogen
, such as
nitrates (NO3-)
, to grow and thrive.
In nature, reactive nitrogen is produced through two primary methods:
Lightning
: The immense energy from lightning breaks nitrogen molecules, allowing them to combine with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides, which later become
in the soil.
Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria
: Certain bacteria, such as
Rhizobia
, form symbiotic relationships with plants like
legumes
, helping convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by plants.
However, these natural processes provide limited amounts of nitrogen, insufficient to support the world’s growing demand for food.
The Haber-Bosch Process:
, developed by
Fritz Haber
and later industrialized by
Carl Bosch
, provided a solution to this problem by creating an artificial method for nitrogen fixation.
The process involves combining nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) under high pressure (around 200 atmospheres) and temperatures of about 400-500°C, in the presence of a catalyst, to produce
Ammonia
produced through this process is a critical ingredient in synthetic fertilizers, which are used to enrich soil and promote plant growth.
The availability of ammonia-based fertilizers has enabled the world’s agricultural productivity to grow exponentially, contributing to a sevenfold increase in the global food supply during the 20th century.
Environmental Impact & Concerns:
While the Haber-Bosch process has been instrumental in solving global food shortages, it also presents significant environmental challenges.
Excessive Nitrogen Use
: The widespread use of nitrogen fertilizers has led to the accumulation of reactive nitrogen in the environment, which can cause
soil degradation
water pollution
air contamination
. Excess nitrogen seeps into waterways through runoff, leading to problems like
eutrophication
—the excessive growth of algae that depletes oxygen in water bodies, killing aquatic life.
Nitrogen Pollution
: Reactive nitrogen released into the atmosphere can combine with water vapor, leading to
acid rain
, which damages ecosystems and erodes infrastructure.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
: The production of ammonia through the Haber-Bosch process requires substantial amounts of energy, primarily from fossil fuels, contributing to the emission of
greenhouse gases
like carbon dioxide (CO2).
Global Food Security and the Haber-Bosch Process:
Despite its environmental drawbacks, the Haber-Bosch process remains essential for
global food security
It is estimated that without synthetic fertilizers, about one-third of the world’s population—nearly
2 billion people
—would face food shortages.
The availability of nitrogen fertilizers has enabled countries to increase crop yields and sustain larger populations.
For instance, in the early 20th century, India had an average life expectancy of only 19 years.
By enabling the mass production of fertilizers, the Haber-Bosch process helped boost food production, contributing to improved health outcomes and increasing life expectancy to over
67 years
Technological Innovation and the Future:
While the Haber-Bosch process has been a crucial technological breakthrough, it is clear that
technological solutions alone cannot solve the challenges of feeding a growing population
Experts suggest that along with continued innovation in fertilizer production, addressing these challenges requires
political action
sustainable farming practices
social mobilization
to minimize environmental damage and ensure equitable food distribution.
The lessons from the Haber-Bosch process underscore the importance of balancing
technological progress
environmental stewardship
social responsibility
Conclusion:
revolutionized agriculture by providing an artificial method to produce nitrogen fertilizers, enabling the world to meet its growing demand for food.
However, its environmental impacts cannot be ignored, as excess nitrogen contributes to pollution, soil degradation, and climate change.
Moving forward, the challenge lies in balancing the benefits of this technology with sustainable practices and innovation to ensure a healthier and more equitable future for all.

**********Mount Adams
Mount Adams, Washington's largest volcano, has recently shown a surge in seismic activity after remaining largely dormant for thousands of years.
About Mount Adams:
It is a
stratovolcano
located in
Washington State, United States.
At 12,277 feet (3,742 meters) high and 18 miles (29 kilometers) wide, Mount Adams is the
largest active volcano in Washington
, surpassing Mount Rainier — the state's highest peak — by volume.
Mount Adams lies in the
middle of the Mount Adams volcanic field
—a 1,250 sq. km area comprising at least 120, mostly
basaltic volcanoes
that form spatter and scoria cones, shield volcanoes, and some extensive lava flows.
supports over 10 active glaciers
that provide water to the forests, streams, and meadows below.
The
most recent eruption
at the site occurred sometime between
3,800 and 7,600 years ago
when humanity was still in the
Stone Age.
What is a Stratovolcano?
Stratovolcanoes (also known as composite volcanoes) are
tall, steep, and cone-shaped
types of volcanoes.
Unlike flat shield volcanoes, they have
higher peaks.
They are
built of successive layers of ash and lava.
The magma (molten rock) within the volcano is viscous and often contains trapped gas, causing explosive eruptions.
occur at the margins of tectonic plates
, large sections of Earth's crust that move together.
The continental plates, composed of less dense material, override the oceanic plates.
Magma generated from the subducting plate rises and squeezes into cracks, eventually reaching the surface in a volcanic eruption.
They comprise the
largest percentage (~60%) of
the Earth's
individual volcanoes
Approximately 85%
of stratovolcanoes are
located around the Pacific Ocean
, forming what is called the “
Ring of Fire.”

**********Right to unionise
Context:
The protests by Samsung India workers in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, center on their fundamental right to form a registered trade union to collectively bargain for better employment terms.
The workers aim to negotiate a collective agreement with Samsung regarding their work conditions.
Workers at the Samsung facility in Sriperumbudur have been on a strike since September 9, 2024, demanding recognition for their newly formed union and an increase in wages.
What’s in today’s article?
Right to Form Trade Unions: Constitutional Protection
Collective Bargaining: Definition and Importance
Right to Strike: Legal Recognition with Restrictions
Why are Samsung workers protesting?
In the 1989
B.
. Singh vs Union of India case
, the Supreme Court upheld the
right to form associations or unions as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution
Restrictions under Article 19(4) can only be imposed if public order, morality, sovereignty, or the integrity of India is at risk, and such restrictions must be logical, not arbitrary.
The court emphasized that
trade unions are essential for voicing workers' grievances
, and the State is obligated to register trade unions to give workers a platform for collective representation.
Registration under the
Trade Unions Act, 1926
, grants unions immunity from civil and criminal action.
According to Section 4 of the Act, even seven members can apply for registration, and the Registrar must ensure the union’s rules comply with the Act.
The Madras High Court, in
Rangaswami vs Registrar of Trade Unions
, defined the purpose of the Trade Unions Act as facilitating the collective bargaining process.
Collective bargaining, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in the 1981 Collective Bargaining Convention, involves negotiations between employees and employers to establish working conditions and terms of employment.
Some labour law scholars described collective bargaining as a balance of power between workers and employers, while others recognized it as a fundamental workers' right.
In India, collective bargaining is
statutorily recognized under the Industrial Disputes Act 1947
If collective bargaining fails, the State may refer the matter to a conciliation officer, and if necessary, to a labour court or industrial tribunal.
The act lists refusal to bargain collectively in good faith as an unfair labour practice.
Historical Evolution of Collective Bargaining
Collective bargaining has its roots in the late 18th and early 19th century, when coal miners fought for basic work conditions.
It became a recognized practice following the Great Depression and World War II, evolving alongside democratic governance worldwide.
In India, early traces of
collective bargaining were seen during the 1918
Ahmedabad Mills strike
led by Mahatma Gandhi
, where a committee of arbitrators was formed to resolve a wage dispute.
Judicial Recognition of Collective Bargaining in India
The Indian Supreme Court has consistently recognized the importance of collective bargaining to achieve social justice.
Karnal Leather Karmchari vs Liberty Footwear Company case
, the court highlighted its significance in modern industrial life.
The court also observed in
Ram Prasad Vishwakarma vs The Chairman, Industrial Tribunal
that before the days of collective bargaining, workers were at a significant disadvantage.
The right to strike is a legal right recognized under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, though with certain restrictions.
The Supreme Court views strikes as a
“form of demonstration” by workers to assert their rights, including various forms such as ‘go-slow,’ ‘sit-in-work,’ and ‘work-to-rule.’
The right to strike is acknowledged by most democratic countries and is seen by the International Labour Organization (ILO) as a natural extension of the right to organize.
However, the
Industrial Disputes Act does not consider the right to strike as absolute
Section 22 mandates conditions for a valid strike, such as the requirement of giving notice to the employer at least six weeks in advance, prohibiting strikes during conciliation proceedings or within seven days after such proceedings end.
The Supreme Court has ruled that while the right to form associations is guaranteed, unions must operate within the bounds of industrial law.
Demand for the recognition of their newly formed Samsung India Workers’ Union (SIWU)
The core issue is the workers’ demand for the recognition of their newly formed Samsung India Workers’ Union (SIWU), under the banner of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU).
CITU is a left-leaning labour organisation affiliated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist).
The company resisted this demand by saying that it is
against the idea of a union engaging in collective bargaining
along with leaders from outside
(involving leaders from CITU).
However, as per experts, Section 6(e) of Trade Unions Act, 1926 allows for the inclusion of honorary or temporary members as union office-bearers, which permits individuals from outside the workforce to assist.
Samsung’s management had also objected to SIWU’s registration on the ground that the name ‘Samsung’ in SIWU’s full form is a trade mark violation.
Section 29(5) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 prohibits the use of a registered trademark in the name of a business.
However, trade unions,
defined under Section 2(h) of the Trade Unions Act, 1926, are not considered business entities but are formed to regulate relations between workers and employers
U.S. courts have developed the concept of 'nominative fair use,' where enough of a company’s distinguishing elements can be used to reasonably associate the union with the company, implying this may apply in Samsung’s case.
Salary
Many protesting workers have complained about not receiving an increase in their wages in the past despite Samsung India earning profits.
Working Conditions
The workers have raised concerns over extensive long hours.
They complained that they were made to work beyond their nine-hour shifts and nature of their work requires them to stand for most part of the shift.

**********What is Article 142 of the Indian Constitution?
The Supreme Court recently refused to entertain a PIL seeking directions under Article 142 to include sexual offences against men, trans persons, and animals under the newly enacted Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).
About Article 142:
It deals with the
Supreme Court's power
to exercise its jurisdiction and pass an order
for doing complete justice
in any cause or matter pending before it.
It provides the apex court with a
special and extraordinary power
and is meant
to provide justice to litigants who have suffered traversed illegality
or injustice
in the course of legal proceedings.
Article 142(1) states that “The Supreme Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it, and
any decree so passed
or order so made shall be
enforceable throughout the territory of India
in such manner
as may be prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament and, until provision in that behalf is so made, in such manner as the
President may by order prescribe”.
Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to
deliver justice
in exceptional cases
where existing provisions or laws are not applicable.
If a legislative enactment seeks to make unenforceable
the decree
or order of the Supreme Court
made under Article 142
, in relation to the cause and the parties between whom it was made, such law would be
void for contravening Article 142[8].
This power
cannot be used to "supplant" substantive law
applicable to the case
or cause under consideration of the court.
Significant cases
where Article 142 was invoked:
Babri Masjid Case:
The article was used in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case and was instrumental in the handover of the disputed land to a trust to be formed by the union government.
Bhopal Gas Tragedy:
The SC invoked its plenary powers in the Union Carbide vs Union Govt case and intervened to provide compensation to victims of the deadly Bhopal Gas Tragedy.

**********What are Darwin’s Finches?
In research published recently, biologists have identified a key connection between ecology and speciation in Darwin's finches, famous residents of the Galapagos Islands.
About Darwin’s Finches:
Darwin’s finches, named after Charles Darwin, are
small land birds.
They comprise a group of
15 species endemic to the Galápagos
(
14 species
)
and Cocos (1 species) Islands
in the
Pacific Ocean.
The group is monophyletic and
originated from
common ancestral species
that reached the Galápagos Archipelago from Central or South America.
Descendants of this ancestor on the Archipelago then colonized Cocos Island.
Darwin’s finches are all
very similar in shape, size, and colour
, but there are a
few differences
which can help when identifying them. These
include diet, habitat, and beak
size and shape.
They’re known for their
remarkably diverse beak
form and function,
evolved to suit
different food types
available across the islands.
From seeds and fruits to invertebrates and even blood, their
widely varied beak
shapes and sizes have
allowed each species to occupy different niches
of the islands.
Darwin’s finches are the
classic example of adaptive radiation
, the evolution of groups of plants or animals into different species adapted to specific ecological niches.

**********What is Haber-Bosch Process?
A hundred million tonnes of nitrogen are now removed from the atmosphere and converted into fertilizer via the Haber-Bosch process, adding 165 million tonnes of reactive nitrogen to the soil.
About Haber-Bosch Process:
It is a process that
fixes nitrogen with hydrogen to produce Ammonia (NH3)
—a critical part of the manufacture of
plant fertilizers
The process was developed in the early 1900s by Fritz Haber and was later modified to become an industrial process to make fertilizers by Carl Bosch.
It is considered by many scientists and scholars as one of the
most important
technological advances
20th century.
It is extremely important because it was the
first of the processes
developed that allowed people
to mass-produce plant fertilizers
due to the production of ammonia.
It was the first industrial chemical process to use high pressure for a chemical reaction.
How does the Haber-Bosch Process Work
directly combines
nitrogen from
air with hydrogen
under extremely
high pressures
moderately
high temperatures.
catalyst
made
mostly from iron
enables the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature than would otherwise be practicable.
The removal of ammonia from the batch as soon as it is formed ensures that an equilibrium favouring product formation is maintained.
The lower the temperature and the higher the pressure used, the greater the proportion of ammonia yielded in the mixture.

**********What are Biopolymers?
Recently, the Union Minister inaugurated India’s first Demonstration Facility for Biopolymers in Pune.
About
Biopolymers:
These are materials that have been
manufactured from biological sources
such as fats, vegetable oils, sugars, resins, and proteins.
The biopolymers have more complex structures than synthetic polymers therefore they are more active in vivo.
Furthermore, as biopolymers are biodegradable their
decomposition is easily done
by
bacteria in the soil environment,
as compared to synthetic polymers which cause environmental pollution due to incineration.
Characteristics
They can control the life processes of living organisms and are environmentally friendly.
They are decomposed by the
processes named –oxidation
(mainly reaction with oxygen), hydrolysis (decomposition by water) or by some enzymes.
Some of them are compostable and can show some chemical properties on their surface.
Biopolymers like polylactic acid, polyglycolate, poly 3-hydroxy butyrate etc. may
show plastic properties and instead.
Benefits:
These polymers can
reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere
and also decrease carbon emissions.
This happens because bio-degradation of these chemical compounds can release carbon dioxide that can be reabsorbed by crops grown as a substitute in their place.

**********India-Canada Diplomatic Escalation Over Nijjar Killing Case
Why in news?
India has ordered the expulsion of six Canadian diplomats, including Acting High Commissioner Stewart Wheeler. It also announced the withdrawal of its own High Commissioner and other diplomats from Canada, citing security concerns.
This comes after Canada identified these Indian diplomats as “persons of interest” in an ongoing investigation into the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in 2023.
What’s in today’s article?
India-Canada Relation
Challenges in India-Canada relations
India-Canada Diplomatic row: Background
Recent Diplomatic Escalation
Allegations by Canadian Police Against Indian Government
Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1947.
Bilateral relation was elevated to a strategic partnership during PM Modi’s visit to Canada in 2015.
Commercial relations
Bilateral Trade Relation -
India was Canada’s 10th largest trading partner
India’s total exports to Canada
added up to US$ 4.10 billion in 2022-23, up from US$ 3.76 billion in 2021-22.
India’s imports from Canada
added up to US$ 4.05 billion in 2022-23, up from US$ 3.13 billion in 2021-22.
CEPA/EPTA negotiations
In March 2022, the two countries had agreed to re-launch the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) negotiations.
Both the countries also decided to have an interim agreement or Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA) that could bring commercial gains to both.
Trade talks were paused in September 2023 following the diplomatic row over the killing of Nijjar.
Nuclear Cooperation
Canadian aid to India in the nuclear field begun in 1956. However, this relationship deteriorated in 1974 after India conducted
Smiling Buddha nuclear test
Canada was among the first countries to participate in India's nuclear power program.
CIRUS, the first research reactor to be built in India, was built with the help of Canada.
Later, in June 2010, the nuclear cooperation was restored when a Nuclear Cooperation Agreement (NCA) with Canada was signed.
People-to-People
Canada hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas in the world, numbering 1.6 million (PIOs and NRIs) which account for more than 4% of its total population.
In the field of politics, in particular, the present House of Commons (total strength of 338) has 22 Members of Parliament of Indian-origin.
Separatist Khalistani groups
Canada has been providing a safe haven for separatist Khalistani groups, which New Delhi sees as the Liberal Party’s pandering to these groups for votes.
Diaspora Sikhs are well represented in the Trudeau government. Some of them are politically supported by pro-Khalistan groups.
Jagmeet ‘Jimmy’ Dhaliwal, whose New Democratic Party supports Trudeau’s minority government in Parliament, is viewed with suspicion by the Indian establishment.
Last year, New Delhi objected to Canada permitting a Khalistani secessionist referendum in the Sikh diaspora.
Canada is slow to act against anti-India elements on its soil
Concerns that Canada is slow to act against anti-India elements on its soil have been a constant irritant in the relationship.
A massive controversy had erupted, in June 2023, over a social media video of a
parade float depicting late PM Indira Gandhi's assassination in Canada
A female figure was shown in a blood-stained white saree, with the hands up, as turbaned men pointed guns at her.
The parade seemed to celebrate the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
Parade was allegedly organised by pro-Khalistani supporters days before the 39th anniversary of ‘Operation Bluestar’ (celebrated on June 6).
Other irritants include
Attacks on Indian-origin people;
Canadian comments over India’s farmer protests and India’s cancellation of diplomatic talks in response.
Death of the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief
Hardeep Singh Nijjar, wanted by the Indian government, was killed in a targeted shooting in June 2023.
In 2022, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) declared a Rs 10 lakh reward on Nijjar.
This was after he was accused of conspiring to kill a Hindu priest in Punjab's Jalandhar.
Nijjar was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey.
Issue raised on the sidelines of G20 Summit
On the sidelines the G20 Summit in Delhi on September 10, Canadian PM and PM Modi had discussed Khalistani extremism.
He also raised the issue of foreign interference in this murder and asked India for cooperation in the investigation.
On the other hand, during the meeting, PM Modi had expressed his deep concerns to Canadian PM about the
ongoing anti-India activities being carried out by extremist elements in Canada
PM Trudeau raises the issue in the parliament of Canada
On September 18, 2023, Trudeau told parliament that Canada was actively pursuing credible allegations, linking Indian government agents to Nijjar's killing.
India dismissed Trudeau's assertion as absurd.
Each country expelled a diplomat in tit-for-tat moves, with Canada throwing out India's top intelligence officer in the country while India expelled his Canadian counterpart.
India’s Response and Diplomatic Withdrawal
India stated it was withdrawing its diplomats due to safety concerns, accusing the Trudeau government of not ensuring their security.
By the evening of October 14, India’s MEA summoned Canadian diplomats and informed them of the decision to expel six of their diplomats.
These developments followed
Ottawa naming India’s High Commissioner to Canada and a few other diplomats as 'persons of interest' in the investigation
into Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's murder.
Long-standing Tensions in India-Canada Relations
India has been critical of Trudeau’s stance on various issues, including his support for the farmers’ protests in India and his perceived leniency towards Khalistani separatist movements.
India accused Canada of sheltering extremists and disregarding extradition requests for individuals involved in organized crime and terrorism against India.
Canada’s Position and Evidence
The Acting High Commissioner of Canada claimed that Canada had presented credible evidence linking Indian agents to Nijjar’s murder and urged India to cooperate in the investigation.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) accused Indian government agents of collaborating with the Lawrence Bishnoi gang to spread terror in Canada.
Lawrence Bishnoi, a gangster from Punjab currently imprisoned in India, is suspected by the Mumbai police to be involved in the recent killing of former MLA Baba Siddiqui.
Bishnoi’s criminal network is reportedly active in Canada, and Canadian authorities allege that the Indian government has used this network for targeting dissidents.

**********Nobel Prize in Economics 2024
Why in News?
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel for 2024 to three US-based economists -
Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A Robinson.
Their research sheds light on a fundamental question that has intrigued economists for decades:
Why are some nations rich while others remain poor?
Their research focuses on the
impact of societal institutions on economic prosperity,
exploring how the frameworks governing behaviour can lead to significant disparities in wealth among countries.

Key Contributions of the 2024 Laureates of the Nobel Prize in Economics:
Classifying institutions:
There are two types of institutions -
Inclusive institutions:
These include
democratic governance
, a strong rule of law, and protection of property rights.
Such frameworks create a stable environment where individuals feel secure in their investments and contributions to society.
Extractive institutions:
In contrast, these systems
concentrate power in the hands of a few
, often characterised by autocracy and a lack of legal protections.
In such environments, individuals face significant risks of confiscation, leading to a lack of motivation for long-term investment.
Significance of this classification:
The type of institutional framework in place
fundamentally shapes the incentives for individuals within an economy.
In countries with inclusive institutions, people are more likely to invest in their futures, drive innovation, and
contribute to overall economic growth
Conversely, in extractive systems, the lack of security and opportunity undermines long-term prosperity,
leading to stagnation or decline
Historical Events Shaping Institutions and Economies:
Colonial legacy:
One of the key contributions of the Nobel laureates is their examination of how historical events, particularly European colonisation,
have shaped modern economic outcomes
They argue that the political and economic systems established by colonisers have lasting effects on the prosperity of nations.
Significance of this examination:
The researchers found
a strong correlation
between the
mortality rates
faced by colonisers in different regions and the
they established.
In areas where colonisers faced high mortality - due to disease or conflict - extractive institutions were more likely to be implemented, focusing on immediate resource extraction.
Conversely, in regions where colonisers could settle safely, inclusive institutions were more likely to take root, benefiting both the colonisers and the local population.
Case Studies of India and China:
Diverging paths - Relationship between political systems and economic success:
The economic trajectories
illustrate the complex interplay between institutions and prosperity
, with its democratic framework and inclusive institutions, has seen relatively slow economic growth compared to
, which has prospered under a more authoritarian regime.
The future outlook:
Despite these differences, some argue that India may still realise its economic potential in the coming decades, as it continues to strengthen its institutions.
Meanwhile, China's future growth may be jeopardised by its lack of inclusive frameworks, suggesting a possible shift in global economic dynamics.
Current Trends of the Democracies Around the World and the Need for Reform:
Declining state of democracies:
The health of democracies is critical for maintaining governance that benefits a broad range of citizens.
However, there is a troubling trend of weakening institutions and growing support for authoritarianism around the world.
The need for reform:
Effective governance, accountability, and broad-based participation are essential for fostering an environment conducive to economic growth and social stability.
For this reason, the importance of inclusive institutions cannot be overstated.
Significance of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Economics:
The ongoing discourse about the interplay between institutions and economic development remains
vital for policymakers and scholars alike
The lessons drawn from this research will be crucial in
addressing disparities and promoting sustainable growth
for future generations.
