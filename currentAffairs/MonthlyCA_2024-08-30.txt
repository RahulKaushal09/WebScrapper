Contemporary Relevance of Jainism
Ahimsa (non-violence):
toward all living beings. This value is significant in today’s nuclear world to attain long lasting peace in the society.
It can also help to
counter growing violence and terrorism.
Non-violence is about treating all living beings as equal. The
concept of equality
is the core of the theory of non-violence.
Killing of the plant kingdom also comes under the ambit of Himsa. As the world marches on towards creating
a sustainably developed world,
the world must keep our forests intact.
The Philosophy that lies behind the
creation of
UNESCO
resembles the thought of Jainism,
which declares that, “Since wars begin in the minds of men. It is in the minds of the men that the defense of peace must be constructed.”
Jainism believes that all living beings have an
equal right to lead a peaceful life
Aparigraha (non-possession):
Aparigraha holds the answer to the problems emanating from rampant consumerism, i.e., the
depletion of natural resources, climate change, and biodiversity loss,
among others.
Curtailing the consumption of unnecessary goods directly addresses this issue.
This value can help in
reducing the issue of global warming
by doing away with unwanted luxuries, which produce carbon emissions.
Today, newspapers are filled with
concerning incidents such as murders, rapes, and fraudulent activities.
The main reason for these crimes is the want for more. These activities not only disrupt the social balance but also degrade the societal values of those individuals.
By inculcating this value, these issues can help in
combating such serious crimes.
It highlights the
spirit of intellectual and social tolerance.
Religious tolerance is required, particularly in India, where hundreds of religions and ideas coexist.
Blasphemy, mob lynching, and religious rioting can be reduced if everyone understands and adheres to this doctrine.
The doctrine of Triratna:
It is relevant to
liberate humans from the subjugation to liberty and freedom.
Conclusion
Jainism holds an important position and has been rightly called
an ethical religion,
applicable and relevant today as it was thousand of years ago.
The Jain ethos
comprehends all aspects of human life
and leads to social development, individual happiness, economic advancement and political harmony.

Why in News?
NCERT's latest textbook revisions include adding findings from
DNA analysis at Rakhigarhi
, emphasising ancient Indian continuity. Other major changes include highlighting
Ahom victories
, using honorifics for
Shivaji,
and rephrasing terms like
"rebel" to "revolt"
in historical contexts.
What are the Key Facts Related to Rakhigarhi?
Location:
Rakhigarhi is an archaeological site situated in the
Hisar district of Haryana
and is located in the
Ghaggar-Hakra
river plain.
Significance
: It is one of the
largest
Indus Valley Civilization
(IVC) sites
and is situated on the
banks of the now-dry Sarasvati River
Three layers of Early, Mature and Late phases of Indus Valley civilization have been found at Rakhigarhi.
Major Findings:
Drainage system, lanes, jewelry unit, copper and gold jewelry, terracotta toys, earthen pots, seals, a burnt-brick wall (possibility of a walled settlement), semi-precious stones such as
agate and carnelian,
two female skeletons buried with a plethora of pottery and adorned jewellery etc.
An important find from this site is a
cylindrical seal with 5 Harappan characters
on one side and a symbol of an alligator on the other.
DNA Analysis of Rakhigarhi:
It suggests a genetic continuity between the
Indus Valley Civilization (IVC)
inhabitants and modern populations, potentially challenging previous theories of large-scale migrations.
This finding adds weight to the argument for an indigenous origin of the IVC, a major civilization of the ancient world.
Ahom Dynasty:
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (1630-1680 CE):
The
Ahom dynasty (1228-1826 CE)
ruled over present-day Assam in northeastern India. They were known for their resistance against powerful empires.

This battle is considered a landmark in Ahom history.
Shivaji established the
Maratha Empire,
a significant power in western India that challenged Mughal dominance.
He employed
innovative guerrilla warfare tactics,
using mobility and surprise attacks to his advantage against larger Mughal forces.
He introduced the collection of two taxes called the
Chauth and Sardeshmukhi
. He also divided his kingdom into four provinces, each headed by a Mamlatdar.
He abolished the

Add Note
Why in the News?
The
Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)
intends to
delist 18 centrally protected monuments out of 24 "untraceable" monuments.
More about News
These 18 monuments are part of an earlier list of monuments that the ASI had said were “untraceable” and it
was assessed that they do not have national importance.
Untraceable monuments were the protected monuments, under the ASI,
whose exact location and condition could not be determined
due to various factors, such as rapid urbanization, difficulties in tracing in remote locations, dense forests, etc.
Among the monuments that face delisting now are a medieval highway milestone recorded as
Kos Minar No.13 (Kos Mi) at Mujessar village in Haryana,
Gunner Burkill’s tomb in Jhansi district, the Telia Nala Buddhist ruins in Varanasi etc.
The Kos-minars,
erected during reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir are the earliest known examples of the 'road milestones'
in the Indian History.
The kos-minar was
built by Mughal emperor Akbar in A.D. 1575
for administrative convenience and also for the
comfort of travellers.
Decision was based on the report
submitted to parliament by the Ministry of Culture titled
"Issues relating to Untraceable Monuments and Protection of Monuments in India”.
About
Delisting” of monument
a monument means it will
no longer receive conservation, protection, and maintenance from the ASI.
Once a monument is delisted,
regular construction and urbanization
activities can take place in the area.

It is done in accordance of
Section 35 of The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958.
It empowers the
Central Government to declare,
whether an ancient and historical monument or
archaeological site
remains have ceased to be of national importance.
There is
no term called “Missing Monuments” in the AMASR Act
and the term only came into existence as it was used by the CAG Audit team on their Report.
Article 49
of the Constitution directs the
state to protect monuments and places and objects of national importance across the country
It provides for
the preservation of ancient and historical monuments and archaeological sites
and remains of national importance.
It also
regulates the archaeological excavations and protection of sculptures,
carvings and other like objects.
Section 4 of the act empowers the Central Government
to declare ancient monuments, etc. to be of National Importance.
National Monuments Authority (NMA)
under the Ministry of Culture has been setup under The AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010.
Its function includes
protection and preservation of monuments and sites
through management of the prohibited and regulated area around the centrally protected monuments.
grants permissions
to applicants for
related activity
prohibited and regulated area.
Challenges in Protecting the Monuments
Uniform Restrictions:
The AMASR Act imposes uniform 100-meter prohibited and 200-meter regulated zones around monuments
, regardless of their unique characteristics, leading to potential inadequacies in protection measures.
Coverage Gaps: Smaller monuments
not covered by
national or state lists lack legal protection, making them vulnerable to development pressures and neglect.
ASI's Limited Powers:
To
address encroachment
delay in publishing notifications,
hindering effective monument protection.
Lacks manpower:
ASI faces staffing and budget constraints, impacting security measures and leaving monuments vulnerable to theft and vandalism.
As per 2022 report of Ministry of Culture,
only 248 of the 3693 protected monuments have guards.
Recommendations
Case-Specific Determination: Develop a framework for determining prohibited and regulated areas
around monuments on a
case-by-case basis
to ensure tailored protection measures.
Flexible Appointment Criteria: Review appointment restrictions for National Monuments Authority (NMA)
to include experienced professionals from ASI or Ministry of Culture.
Legal Coverage
Amend the Constitution to include "
ancient and historical monuments other than those declared to be of national importance
" in the Concurrent List
This will enable
the central government to enforce provisions for the conservation of monuments
and sites not covered by the Union List or State List.
Empower ASI
: It recommends
ministry to prescribe a time-bound limit for ASI to publish the final notification.
Also incorporate
