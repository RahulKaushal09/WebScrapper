TUNGABHADRA
Syllabus
Prelims – GEOGRAPHY
Context:
A flood alert has been sounded downstream of the Tungabhadra dam in Karnataka’s Koppal district after one of the crest gates of the massive stone masonry dam across the Tungabhadra river was washed away.
Background:-
Repairs to restore gate can be carried out only after two-thirds of the dam is emptied.
About Tungabhadra river and dam
The Tungabhadra River originates in Karnataka and flows primarily through the state before entering Andhra Pradesh, where it eventually merges with the Krishna River.
The river Tungabhadra derives its name from two streams viz., the Tunga, and the Bhadra which rise in the Western Ghats. The river after the confluence of the two streams near Shimoga, runs for about 531 km till it joins the river Krishna at Sangamaleshwaram in Andhra Pradesh.
It runs for 382 km in Karnataka, forms the boundary between Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for 58 km and further runs for the next 91 km in Andhra Pradesh.
The confluence of Tungabhadra and Krishna River is a holy pilgrimage site – The Sangameswaram Temple.
Hampi one of the important heritage locations being listed by UNESCO is on the banks of the Tunga Bhadra River.
Nava Brindavan, an island where the final resting location of nine holy Madhva saints is in the midst of the Tunga Bhadra River.
It is influenced chiefly by the South-West monsoon. It is a perennial river but the summer flows dwindle to as low as 2.83 to 1.42 cumec.
Tungabhadra Dam
The Tungabhadra reservoir sprawls over an area of 378 sq km primarily in Karnataka’s Vijayanagar district. It is one of the major reservoirs in South India that supplies water for irrigation and industrial use, as well as drinking water to Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
The dam was first conceived of in 1860 to mitigate the impact of recurrent famine in Rayalaseema. Construction was begun by the erstwhile governments of Hyderabad and Madras in 1945, and the project was completed in 1953.
The Tungabhadra Board was established by a presidential order in 1953. The Board currently has a chairman appointed by the Union government, and four members, representing the Union government and the states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.
The Tungabhadra reservoir and the Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala hold the unique distinction of being the only two reservoirs in the country that were built using a combination of mud and limestone.

GOVERNANCE IN DELHI
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
The Supreme Court has ruled that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi can independently nominate 10 aldermen to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi without consulting the council of ministers. This decision has heightened tensions between the Union government, the Delhi government, and the local administration.
People of Delhi should get responsible and responsive governance from all three layers of government irrespective of party  in power.
Evolution of the Delhi Government
1950: At the commencement of the Constitution, Delhi was a Part C State.
1956: During the States Reorganisation, Delhi was made a Union Territory, governed by an administrator.
The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was established in 1958 and a limited local government was established since 1966.
1991: Following the Balakrishnan Committee’s (1989) recommendations, the 69th Constitutional Amendment provided Delhi with a Legislative Assembly and a council of ministers. However, public order, police, and land remained under Union government control. Government of NCT of Delhi Act, 1991 provided detailed provisions regarding Delhi’s legislature, executive, and administration.
Present Issues
Political Conflict (2015-Present):
Ongoing clashes between the Union government (BJP) and the Delhi government (AAP) over various issues.
The judgments of the Supreme Court have resulted in amendments to the Government of NCT of Delhi Act that have curtailed the powers of the elected government in Delhi
MCD and Local Governance:
Apart from the issues between the Union and the Delhi government, the MCD with its elected representatives add another dimension to the problem as was witnessed in the recent unfortunate loss of lives due to electrocution and flooding in Delhi.
Public accountability has been undermined by the blame-shifting among elected officials.

Proposed Way Forward
As part of its judgment in 2023, the Supreme Court mentioned that there is a triple chain of accountability in a democracy. The officials are accountable to the ministers; the council of ministers are collectively responsible to the legislative assembly; and the legislative assembly members are accountable to the people.
The constant tussle between various layers of government ruptures such a chain of accountability.
Potential Structural Changes:
The NCT of Delhi covers 1,450 sq km, while New Delhi, which houses central government offices and foreign embassies, spans about 50 sq km.
For comparison, Washington DC, the U.S. capital district, is 177 sq km. A similar approach could be adopted in India, where 50-100 sq km of New Delhi is placed under complete Central government control, with the remaining areas governed by the Delhi Assembly.
Implementing this would require a constitutional amendment. In the meantime, the spirit of the Supreme Court’s 2023 judgment should be upheld.

HOW WILL SHEIKH HASINA’S EXIT IMPACT INDIA
Mains – GS 2
After protests in Bangladesh forced former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India, her future remains unclear. While the Modi government has provided her shelter, it is also engaging with the new regime, assessing the impact of Bangladesh’s political changes on India’s relations with the country.
India and Bangladesh were creating new milestones in bilateral relationship under former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
Impact of Sheikh Hasina’s Ouster on India
Setback for India: Sheikh Hasina’s removal is a significant setback for India, jeopardizing the progress made in economic ties, border security, defense, trade, and connectivity.
Transformation Under Hasina
Strong Ties with India:
Since her 2009 return to office, Hasina prioritized strong relations with India, cracking down on terror camps, campaign against religious radicalisation, addressing border tensions, and extradited over 20 “most wanted” men accused of terrorism and crime to India.
In sharp contrast to her predecessor Khaleda Zia’s government, Ms. Hasina also worked on ending border tensions caused by illegal immigration into India.Several border patrolling agreements and the signing of the historic 2015 land boundary agreement followed.
Economic and Trade Cooperation: India provided trade concessions and low-interest Lines of Credit, helping Bangladesh transform into a developing country with improved human development indices. Bangladesh has become a lynchpin to India’s regional connectivity plans to Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific, and an important buyer of Indian energy off the subcontinental grid.
Support on Key Issues: Hasina supported India on various issues, including boycotting SAARC due to terrorism from Pakistan and backing the Citizenship Amendment Act despite protests in Bangladesh.
Future Relations with the New Government
Engagement with New Regime: India is engaging with the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, though complications arise due to Hasina’s presence in India and potential future demands for her extradition.
Uncertainty with BNP: If the BNP, led by Khaleda Zia, wins future elections, India’s experience could be challenging, given past tensions and increased influence from China and Pakistan.
Minority Concerns: Modi’s appeal for the safety of minorities in Bangladesh and the establishment of a committee to maintain communication with Bangladesh to ensure the safety of Indian citizens and people belonging to minority communities may complicate ties with Dhaka further.
Changes in Bangladesh’s Foreign Relations
Improved U.S. Ties: Relations with the U.S. may improve, as the Hasina government was often at odds with Washington.
Shifts with Pakistan and China: Relations with Pakistan may thaw, and China is expected to maintain strong ties with the new government, continuing its influence through the Belt and Road Initiative.

DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DDOS) ATTACK
Prelims – SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
A conversation between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk on Musk’s social media platform X was disrupted by technical glitches, which Musk attributed to a DDoS attack.
The conversation was highly anticipated, marking Trump’s notable return to X after his 2021 ban from Twitter following the Capitol riots. Musk has strongly endorsed Trump as presidential candidate, so bringing the former president onto his platform for a conversation was a move that captured public attention.
Key takeaways
A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic.
How DDoS Attacks Work
Botnets: DDoS attacks are typically carried out using networks of internet-connected devices (botnets) that have been infected with malware. These devices, often referred to as bots or zombies, are controlled remotely by the attacker.
Traffic Flooding: The attacker directs the botnet to send an overwhelming amount of traffic to the target’s IP address. This can exhaust the target’s bandwidth, RAM, or other resources, causing the system to slow down or crash.
Types of DDoS Attacks:
Volume-based attacks: These aim to saturate the bandwidth of the target site.
Protocol attacks: These focus on exploiting weaknesses in network protocols.
Application layer attacks: These target specific applications or services.
Identifying a DDoS Attack
A sudden slowdown or unavailability of a site or service is a common sign. Other indicators include unusual traffic patterns, such as spikes at odd hours or a flood of traffic from a single IP address.
Motivations Behind DDoS Attacks
Financial Gain: Attackers may demand ransom to stop the attack.
Competitor Sabotage: Businesses may use DDoS attacks to disrupt competitors.
Hacktivism: Individuals or groups may launch attacks to make a political statement.

BIOFORTIFIED CROPS
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
: Recently, the Prime Minister of India released 109 high yielding, climate resilient and biofortified varieties of crops at India Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi
The launch of these varieties represents a significant advancement in the government’s effort to strengthen and future-proof Indian agriculture.
About Biofortification
Biofortification is the process of improving the nutritional quality of food crops. This can be achieved through two main methods:
Conventional Breeding: This involves selecting and crossbreeding plants that naturally have higher levels of certain nutrients. Over time, this process enhances the nutrient content of the crops.
Genetic Engineering: This method involves directly modifying the plant’s genes to increase the levels of specific nutrients.
It aimed at developing and disseminating crops that are naturally rich in essential micronutrients, containing higher levels of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.
Benefits:
Improved Nutrition: Helps combat micronutrient deficiencies, especially in low and middle-income countries.
Accessibility: Provides essential nutrients to rural populations who may not have access to commercially fortified foods.
Examples:
Golden Rice: Enhanced with beta-carotene to address vitamin A deficiency.
Iron and Zinc-Enriched Wheat: Developed through radiation breeding to improve iron and zinc content.

**********ILO to help Eliminate Child Labour, Forced Work in Cotton Fields
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Child Labour (Meaning, International Organisations)
Child Labour in India (Statistics, Related Acts and Rules)
News Summary
What is Child Labour?
The term “child labour” is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical and mental development.
Whether or not particular forms of “work” can be called “child labour” depends on the child’s age, the type and hours of work performed and the conditions under which it is performed. This definition varies from country to country.
International Organisations w.r.t. Child Labour:
United Nations Children’s Fund
UNICEF, also known as the United Nations Children’s Fund, is a United Nations agency.
Objective
: To provide humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide.
UNICEF is guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989.
It relies entirely on voluntary contributions from governments and private donors.
UNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being of children.
Headquarters
: New York, U.S.
International Labour Organisation
(ILO):
Founded in 1919 (under the League of Nations), it is the first and oldest specialised agency of the UN.
Objective:
To advance social and economic justice through setting international labour standards.
Unlike other UN specialized agencies, the ILO has a tripartite governing structure that brings together governments, employers, and workers of member states, to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and men.
Headquarters:
Geneva, Switzerland
Child Labour in India:
There are around
12.9 million children in India
, engaged in work between the ages of 7 to 17 years old.
Rural India has the highest percentage of child labour, accounting to 80% of the total burden in India.
The highest number of child labourers work in Uttar Pradesh.
Apart from industrial and agricultural tasks, many are made to work as maids, baby sitters by the privileged.
Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016:
The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 amended the original Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act of 1986.
The Amendment Act provides for
complete prohibition on employment or work of children below 14 years and also prohibits employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations and processes
child is permitted to work only to help family, in family enterprise or as child artist after school hours or during vacations
The offences under the Act have now been made compoundable and cognizable notwithstanding the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.
It provides for setting up of the
Child and Adolescent Labour Rehabilitation Fund
in which all the amounts of penalty have to be realised.
After strengthening the legislative framework through amendment in Child Labour Act, Government has framed the
Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2017
The Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2017
specifies the duties and responsibilities of State Governments and District Authorities to ensure effective enforcement of the provisions of the Act
ILO to help Eliminate Child Labour, Forced Work in Cotton Fields:

**********Joint Parliamentary Committees (JPC) on Financial Allegations
Why in News?
The Opposition has demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate the Hindenburg Research allegations against SEBI’s chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is a Joint Parliamentary Committees (JPC)
JPCs to Investigate Alleged Financial Crimes
What is a Joint Parliamentary Committees (JPC)?
Background:
In India, a structured committee system was introduced in
1993
to provide for greater scrutiny of government functioning by Parliament.
About a JPC:
These are set up by a motion
passed in one house of Parliament and agreed to by the other.
Its members include MPs from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha (in proportion to party strengths there, and therefore
representation of LS is double that of RS
).
Therefore, a JPC is
an ad-hoc body
, which acts as a
mini-Parliament
to carry out detailed scrutiny of a specific matter within a specific time frame.
How many JPCs have there been so far?
Although a number of joint committees have been formed since Independence,
4 major JPCs
have been formed to investigate significant issues that have caused controversy.
These are:
Joint Committee on Bofors Contracts;
Joint Committee to enquire into irregularities in securities and banking transactions;
Joint Committee on stock-market scam; and
Joint Committee on pesticide residues in and safety standards for soft drinks.
The details regarding membership and subjects:
These are also decided by Parliament. For example,
The motion on the stock market scam constituted a JPC of 30 members (20 were from the LS and 10 from the RS).
The motion to constitute the JPC on pesticides included 10 members from the LS and 5 from the RS.
The terms of reference
for the JPC on the stock market scam asked the committee
To look into financial irregularities,
To fix responsibility on persons and institutions for the scam,
To identify regulatory loopholes and
To make suitable recommendations.
How effective have JPCs been?
JPC recommendations
have persuasive value
and the committee cannot force the government to take any action on the basis of its report.
The government may decide to launch fresh investigations on the basis of a JPC report.
The government is required to report on the follow-up action
taken on the basis of the recommendations of the JPC.
The committee then submits ‘
Action Taken Reports
’ in Parliament on the basis of the government’s reply.
These reports can be discussed in Parliament
and the government can be questioned on the basis of the same.
JPCs to Investigate Alleged Financial Crimes:
2G Spectrum (2013):
The JPC report cleared the then PM (Manmohan Singh) of any wrongdoing, claiming he had been misinformed about the process the Department of Telecommunications will use to grant licenses for Unified Access Services.
Share Market Scam (2001):
A JPC was formed, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was PM, and its report recommended sweeping changes in stock market regulations. However, its recommendations were not fully implemented.
Securities and Banking Transactions (1992):
Allegations that “Big Bull” Harshad Mehta had diverted funds from the public sector Maruti Udyog Limited to his own accounts, leading to a 570-point fall in the Sensex.
This led to the formation of JPC during the tenure of PM P V Narasimha Rao.

**********Civil Registration System (CRS) Portal Facing Glitches
Why in news?
The Union government's centralised Civil Registration System (CRS) portal, used for registering births and deaths, has been facing technical issues for the past four months, causing delays in the issuance of certificates.
Under the
Registration of Births and Deaths (Amendment) Act of 2023
, all births and deaths in India from October 1, 2023, must be
digitally registered
through this portal. So far 23 states & 6 UTs have migrated to this new portal.
The digital birth certificates will serve as a single document for various services, including education, government jobs, and marriage registration.
Additionally, the centralised database will update the National Population Register (NPR), which has 119 crore residents and serves as a precursor to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) under the Citizenship Act.
What’s in today’s article?
Civil Registration System – About, Recent initiatives to strengthen CRS
Civil Registration System (CRS) in India
With the enactment of the
Registration of Births and Death Act (RBD Act) in 1969
, the registration of births, deaths and still births have become mandatory in India.
The Registrar General, India (RGI) at the Central Government level coordinates and unifies the activities of registration throughout the country.
However, implementation of the statute is vested with the State Governments.
The registration of births and deaths in the country is done by the functionaries appointed by the State Governments.
The Chief Registrar of Births and Deaths is mandated to publish a statistical report on the registered births and deaths during the year.
Uniform Software Application for Registration of Births and Deaths
A software application for online and offline registration of birth and death has been developed.
The application that is presently available in English is being customized in 13 Indian languages.
Database of Institutions
A nationwide database of medical Institutions has been prepared.
The plan is to electronically monitor the registration of events occurring in these institutions through an ICT enabled platform.
Application to Monitor Institutional Events
An SMS based application called "
Event Monitoring System for Registration
" has been developed and is currently under pilot testing.
Data digitization
Project to keep old records easily located to retrieve digital form has been started.
This will help in storage of registers in electronic format and allow easy access to the records.
The Civil Registration System has been linked to the NPR.
Capacity Building of Registrars:
Training the registration functionaries in 13 languages by providing financial assistance to the State Governments.

**********Movement of ballast water in India
Why in news?
The Tamil Nadu Water Resources Department (WRD) has informed the National Green Tribunal that it has requested ₹160 crore from Kamarajar Port in Ennore, Tamil Nadu, to address the removal of invasive
charru mussels (Mytella strigata)
along the coast. These mussels are harming marine ecosystems and obstructing fisher boat movements, impacting livelihoods.
The WRD accuses Kamarajar Port of contributing to the spread of the invasive species by failing to regulate ballast water from ships.
What’s in today’s article?
Invasive Species and Their Threat to Ecosystems
Ballast water
Laws regulating movement of ballast water
About
Invasive species are non-native organisms that are introduced, either accidentally or intentionally, into a new environment where they do not naturally occur.
These species often spread rapidly and can cause significant harm to the local ecosystems, economies, and human health.
Invasive species can outcompete native species for resources, alter habitats, disrupt food webs, and even lead to the extinction of native species.
One of the primary ways invasive species are introduced is through human activities, such as global trade and transportation.
For example, ballast water from ships, which is used to stabilize vessels, often contains various marine organisms. When this water is discharged in a new location, it can introduce invasive species to the area.
Case Study: Charru Mussels (Mytella strigata)
It is an example of an invasive species that has become a significant ecological threat.
Native to South America, the charru mussel has spread to other regions, including the coast near Kamarajar Port in Ennore, Tamil Nadu.
The spread of this species is largely attributed to ballast water discharge from ships, which is not adequately regulated.
Threats posed
to marine ecosystems
It reproduces quickly and forms dense colonies, which can outcompete native species for space and resources.
The mussels attach to various surfaces, including rocks, other marine organisms, and even man-made structures like boats and docks.
This can lead to the displacement of native species, changes in habitat structure, and a reduction in biodiversity.
In the Ennore region, the proliferation of charru mussels has also had economic and social impacts.
The dense colonies of mussels hinder the movement of fishing boats, affecting the livelihoods of local fishermen.
Ships require a certain level of immersion in the sea for stability. To maintain this, when cargo is offloaded and the ship rises, then sea water (known as ballast water) is taken into tanks onboard.
Conversely, when cargo is loaded and the ship sinks lower in the water, the ballast water is pumped out.
Background
Traditionally, there were no restrictions on the intake and discharge of ballast water at various locations, including ports and along coasts.
However, since ballast water can carry invasive species that harm ecosystems in other countries, the global shipping industry has moved to regulate ballast water discharge.
In India, scientists have recorded nearly 30 invasive species coming from ship ballast water.
Among the most harmful in recent times is the charru mussel
In the Pulicat lake in Tamil Nadu, as in Ashtamudi lake in Kerala, this mussel has replaced almost all other species.
Its survival rate and egg production is very high. Though of marine origin, it can survive even in fresh water.
Global regulations
Ballast Water Management (BWM) Convention
, enforced by the International Maritime Organization (
IMO
) since 2017, aims to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens through ships' ballast water.
Ships must now manage their ballast water to remove or neutralize these organisms before discharge in new locations.
Newly built ships with ballast water management systems treat the water with chemicals to eliminate biological organisms.
Older ships without such systems are required to exchange ballast water taken in at ports with
neutral ocean water during their journey
Countries like Australia and New Zealand are particularly strict in enforcing these regulations to protect their marine ecosystems.
Australia, which frequently handles ballast water due to its role as a major raw material supplier, conducts rigorous checks on ships, especially near sensitive areas like the Great Barrier Reef, to prevent ecological damage.
Situation in India
As of July 2024, 97 countries have signed the BWM Convention of IMO,
but India is not among them
Consequently, ships docking at Indian ports are not obligated to follow the BWM Convention.
While Indian ports enforce other rules, such as those related to oil discharge, ballast water remains unchecked.
Way forward for India
Maritime law experts note that
ports are facilitators and cannot be held liable unless a law is in place
If there is any evidence that a vessel has pumped out the ballast water that led to the invasive species, then the vessel owner can be held liable if a law is in force.
Hence, India must join the BWM Convention to address this gap.
