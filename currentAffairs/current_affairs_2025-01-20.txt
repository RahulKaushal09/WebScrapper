Recasting Insolvency Resolution
Context
The
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC),
stands as a cornerstone of India’s economic reforms, aiming to streamline insolvency resolution and improve economic efficiency.
Introduced with the promise of strengthening India’s business environment
and addressing bad loans and defaults, the IBC has achieved significant milestones.
However,
its implementation has exposed structural and procedural inefficiencies, necessitating a comprehensive re-evaluation.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC)
was introduced to address the growing problem of corporate defaults and to streamline the resolution of insolvencies in India.
A key component of its implementation hinges on the functioning of two crucial bodies: the
National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)
and its appellate counterpart, the
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)
Together,
these tribunals serve as the primary adjudicating forums
for insolvency matters and corporate governance, making their effectiveness central to the success of the IBC.
the burden on these institutions has become a significant challenge,
exposing flaws in both the institutional design and procedural functioning.
A Detailed Examination of the Burden on Institutional Architecture of IBC
Dual Responsibility: A Structural Imbalance
NCLT and NCLAT were initially tasked with handling corporate insolvency cases
under the IBC.
Over time,
their responsibilities have expanded to include a wide range of cases
related to the
Companies Act, 2013
governs a wide array of corporate governance issues, such as mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructuring, and shareholder disputes.
While these functions are critical, their combination with insolvency cases has stretched the tribunals' capacity,
placing an additional burden on an already overworked system.
The result is a
dual responsibility
that leaves the NCLT and NCLAT struggling to manage their workload efficiently.
A Temporal Disjunction: Outdated Design
Another significant flaw in the current institutional architecture is the
temporal disjunction between the NCLT's original design and the contemporary demands it faces.
Established in 1999 following the recommendations of the
Eradi Committee and operationalised in 2016,
the NCLT was conceived during a time when the Indian economy was in a very different phase
of development.
economic realities and the business environment in the late 1990s were vastly different
from the fast-paced, globalised, and highly dynamic economic landscape of today. The NCLT’s structure reflects these past realities.
With a sanctioned strength of only 63 members, many of whom divide their time across multiple benches,
the tribunal is ill-equipped to deal with the volume of cases it now faces.
Furthermore,
the NCLT’s design has not evolved to meet the modern demands of corporate governance and insolvency resolution,
leaving it structurally inadequate for handling the complexities of contemporary business transactions.
An Analysis of Deficiencies in the Current Framework
Gaps in Expertise and Procedural Efficiency
High-stakes insolvency matters require specialised knowledge,
yet appointments often overlook this critical need.
As noted by the Supreme Court in the
Jet Airways
case, the absence of expertise hampers the ability to address the nuanced complexities of insolvency matters effectively.
Moreover,
bureaucratic inefficiencies compound the problem.
For instance, the NCLT Registry’s discretion over case listings creates a bureaucratic bottleneck,
often delaying urgent matters.
Worse still, a growing tendency among NCLT and NCLAT members to disregard Supreme Court orders
threatens the integrity of India’s judicial hierarchy.
These
issues highlight not only inefficiency but also a deeper crisis
of institutional integrity.
Limited Use of Alternatives and Structural Rethink
procedural framework further exacerbates delays.
requirement for mandatory hearings for all applications, even those unrelated to substantive matters, consumes valuable time
without adding to the resolution process.
Additionally,
the sparse use of alternative dispute resolution methods places undue pressure
on an already overburdened system.
Countries worldwide face similar challenges in insolvency resolution.
However, India’s unique scale, compounded by systemic corruption and ambitious economic goals, necessitates bold and innovative solutions.
Promisingly, recent reform proposals—such as mandatory mediation before insolvency filings
—signal a
move in the right direction.
Bottleneck Effect: Backlog of Cases
mismatch between the NCLT’s workload and its capacity to handle it has led to a bottleneck effect
in the system.
This backlog has resulted in significant delays in the resolution of insolvency cases.
According to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), the average time for insolvency resolution has steadily increased over the years,
reaching 716 days in FY2023-24 compared to 654 days the previous year.
This represents a concerning trend that indicates systemic inefficiencies
, despite repeated calls from the Supreme Court for strict adherence to timelines under the IBC.
Jet Airways case serves as a stark example of these delays.
Despite the Court’s clear directives, including warnings about the potential obsolescence of the Code if delays continue,
the NCLT and NCLAT’s inefficiencies have led to a drawn-out process.
The Court's repeated instructions to adhere to timelines underscore the critical need for a timely and efficient judicial process in insolvency matters,
which has not been realised under the current institutional setup.
Implications for Corporate Health and Economic Stability
The inefficiencies in the NCLT and NCLAT systems have
far-reaching implications for the broader Indian economy.
primary purpose of the IBC is to resolve insolvencies and help struggling businesses get back on track,
thereby ensuring that they do not become a burden on the economy.
delays in the insolvency resolution process create a
cloud of uncertainty
for creditors, investors, and companies.
uncertainty discourages investment and undermines confidence in India’s business environment.
the inefficiencies also hinder the smooth execution of corporate transactions
such as mergers, acquisitions, and reorganizations.
NCLT’s delayed handling
of such transactions often results in lost opportunities, as businesses may have to wait for months or even years before the necessary approvals are granted.
The Path Forward: Reimagining India’s Insolvency Framework
Need for a Hybrid Model and Specialised Benches
First,
there is a need for a hybrid model that combines judicial experience with domain expertise.
could involve specialised training for tribunal members
or appointing experts in finance, law, and corporate restructuring to handle complex cases.
Second,
procedural innovations are critical. Introducing specialised benches for distinct categories of cases,
such as mergers and amalgamations, would enhance both efficiency and specialisation.
Infrastructure Development
Infrastructure development must also take centre stage.
Adequate courtrooms and a permanent, well-trained support staff are indispensable
for sustaining the NCLT and NCLAT.
IBC must transcend its current role as a debt resolution mechanism and evolve into a proactive tool
for economic rejuvenation.
Conclusion
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, holds immense potential to transform India’s economic landscape.
realising this potential requires a bold reimagining of its institutional framework,
procedural practices, and infrastructure.
At this critical juncture,
India must prioritise efficiency, expertise, and integrity in its insolvency regime to align with its global economic ambitions.

Editorial Analysis
**********A Surge in Radical Governments, the Hope of Democracy
Context
The
trajectory of global reactions to Islamic radicalism highlights a stark pattern
: legitimacy and engagement appear conditional on power consolidation by these groups.
cases of Afghanistan in 2021, Syria in 2024, and the recent developments in Bangladesh exemplify this trend.
Amid these developments,
it is important to examine these scenarios, emphasising the broader implications for regional stability and international relations.
A Case Study in Legitimising Radical Regimes: The Taliban and Afghanistan
The U.S. and Global Powers’ Response
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan culminated in a chaotic handover
, highlighted by the deadly suicide bombing at Kabul airport, killing 13 U.S. troops and many Afghan civilians.
logistical mishap of leaving $7.1 billion worth of U.S. military equipment behind further compounded the situation
, raising concerns about these resources being used to bolster Taliban control.
Yet,
despite this backdrop, global powers, including the U.S., China, and Russia, moved swiftly to engage with the new regime.
The Irony of International Cooperation
cooperation extended to the Taliban by the Troika Plus (U.S., China, Russia, and Pakistan) starkly contrasted with the preceding efforts to marginalise India’s role in Afghanistan.
In the weeks leading to the Taliban’s takeover,
this coalition sought to exclude India from discussions on Afghanistan’s future.
For example,
a reference to the Heart of Asia Conference on Afghanistan was removed from a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) draft statement due to India’s involvement
in the conference.
However,
events took an ironic turn when India assumed the presidency of the UNSC
in August 2021, just as the Taliban seized power.
This
position allowed India to influence UNSC Resolution 2593
, which emphasised that Afghan soil should not be used for terrorist activities.
India played a pivotal role in ensuring that the resolution explicitly referenced terrorist organisations
, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, both linked to Pakistan.
Despite this diplomatic success
, global powers exhibited little political will to enforce the resolution, allowing the Taliban to operate without accountability.
The Case of Syria and Bangladesh
Syria: A Recurrent Pattern
toppling of Bashar al-Assad in 2024
by Abu Muhammad al-Jolani, leader of Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS),
mirrors the Taliban’s ascent.
Once a figurehead of al Qaeda in Syria,
al-Jolani’s transition from terrorist to political leader has not erased his extremist past.
Yet, the U.S. and the West have rapidly recalibrated their stance
, including removing a $10 million bounty on his capture.
shift exemplifies how power acquisition can shield leaders of radical groups from accountability
, fostering a precedent that may embolden other extremist factions.
The Bangladesh Conundrum
collapse of Sheikh Hasina’s government and the subsequent rise of an interim military-led administration under Muhammad Yunus have reintroduced Islamic radical group
s into the political mainstream.
Organisations like the Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) and Jamaat-e-Islami have exploited the instability
to promote their extremist agendas, deepening religious tensions and threatening regional stability.
India’s strategic interests in Bangladesh are at stake
. Over the past 16 years, bilateral relations have flourished, driven by Sheikh Hasina’s secular governance.
the resurgence of radicalism risks undoing these gains.
The anti-India rhetoric adopted by the interim government’s advisors threatens to polarise the region,
creating a volatile environment reminiscent of Syria or Afghanistan.
Implications for Global Governance
Erosion of International Norms
normalisation of regimes like the Taliban and Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) undermines the principles of international law
and governance.
These
groups often gain recognition despite violating core UN mandates on human rights
, terrorism, and inclusivity.
selective application of norms creates a dangerous precedent
, signalling that the international community is willing to overlook atrocities if political expediency demands it.
Empowerment of Extremist Groups
legitimisation of radical groups following their rise to power sends a clear message to other extremist organisations
: achieving control through violence or authoritarianism can yield international acceptance.
This emboldens groups such as al Qaeda affiliates and IS-inspired factions, particularly in unstable regions like Africa and South Asia
, where governments are already grappling with insurgencies.
Human Rights as a Bargaining Chip
sidelining of human rights in favour of diplomatic engagement has left vulnerable populations
, women, minorities, and dissenters, at the mercy of oppressive regimes.
In Afghanistan,
the Taliban’s actions have reversed decades of progress on gender equality and education.
Similarly,
the international community’s failure to hold such regimes accountable weakens global advocacy for universal human rights.
The Larger Picture in India-Bangladesh Relations Post the Collapse of Elected Government in Bangladesh
Avoid Viewing Events through a Religious Lens
Both India and Bangladesh should avoid interpreting events solely from a religious perspective
, whether Islamic or Hindu.
Such a narrow view has been harmful in the past
and will remain counterproductive.
Islamic radicals and some advisers to Mr. Yunus are intentionally trying to create divisions
within their own country by baiting India.
India's Approach to Bilateral Relations
India aims to protect its relationship with Bangladesh
and has expressed its willingness to work with the interim government.
Over the past two decades,
India has resolved most bilateral issues except for the sharing of Teesta River waters.
Notably, during the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) revolt in 2009, India strongly supported Bangladesh’s newly elected government
and played a key role in preserving its democracy.
The Way Forward
Principled Diplomacy over Expediency
international community must prioritise long-term stability and human rights over short-term gains.
includes refusing to recognise or engage with regimes that come to power through violence or oppression
without demanding accountability.
Diplomatic channels can be used as leverage to enforce compliance
with international norms rather than as tools for legitimisation.
Strengthening Multilateral Mechanisms
Global organisations like the United Nations need to strengthen their capacity
to address the rise of radical regimes.
This involves better enforcement of existing resolutions, such as UNSC Resolution 2593,
and a commitment to upholding international law.
Multilateral coalitions should work to ensure that economic aid and resources are conditional upon progress in governance
, human rights, and counter-terrorism measures.
Global Attention to Religiophobia
Religious extremism often thrives in environments of polarisation
and prejudice.
India’s efforts at the UN to highlight religiophobia against non-Abrahamic faiths, Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists
, are a step in the right direction.
Expanding this discourse to address all forms of religious hatred can create greater global solidarity
in combating extremism.
Conclusion
The cases of Afghanistan, Syria, and Bangladesh illustrate a troubling global trend: the selective legitimisation of Islamic radical groups
based on their grip on power.
This approach not only undermines efforts to combat extremism but also destabilises regions
already fraught with tensions.
For nations like India,
the path forward requires a delicate balance, engaging with current regimes while remaining steadfast in opposing radicalism.

**********How is TRAI and the Govt. Combating Spam?
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Blockchain Technology (Meaning, Working, Applications, etc.)
Background (Context)
Spam (TRAI’s Role, Technological Interventions, Effectiveness, Way Forward, etc.)
What is Blockchain Technology (BCT)?
Blockchain is a type of decentralised database in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a
hash
This decentralised database is managed by multiple participants and it is known as
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited.
In this way,
a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed
Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions.
Difference Between Typical Database and BCT:
The key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is how the data is structured.
A database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together.
This data structure inherently makes an irreversible time line of data when implemented in a decentralized nature.
Applications of BCT:
Apart from cryptocurrency, there are numerous other real-life applications of blockchain technology, such as:
Money transfer, Lending, Insurance, Secure personal information, Voting, Government scheme benefits, Securely share medical information, Artist royalties, etc.
Background:
Unsolicited Commercial Communications
(UCC), commonly known as
spam
, has become a significant challenge in India, ranging from irritating marketing messages to fraudulent schemes targeting financial information.
To counter this growing menace, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) have implemented several measures, leveraging advanced technologies like
and expanding public reporting systems.
TRAI’s Role in Combating Spam:
TRAI has been instrumental in regulating and minimizing spam through various initiatives:
Do-Not-Disturb (DND) Registry
Introduced in 2007, the registry allows telecom customers to block spam calls and messages by registering their preferences.
Telemarketers violating DND rules face warnings and eventual blacklisting under the
Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation (TCCCPR), 2018
In 2024, DND reporting was mandated across all telecom provider apps for easier user access.
Blockchain-Based Solutions
TRAI mandated telecom companies to use
for maintaining an updated list of approved SMS senders and formats.
Blockchain ensures data immutability, making it difficult for unauthorized entities to bypass regulations.
In 2024, these rules were further tightened to enhance traceability, requiring telcos to maintain a complete record of sender credentials before messages are transmitted.
Monitoring International and Fraudulent Spam
Fraudulent spam calls, often originating from disposable VoIP numbers, remain a challenge due to their ability to appear as legitimate international traffic.
TRAI is working to tackle these issues through enhanced real-time monitoring.
Technological Interventions:
Sanchar Saathi Portal
Developed by the DoT, the portal includes
Chakshu
, which enables citizens to report fraudulent calls and messages.
The government has deactivated thousands of unauthorized telemarketers’ numbers through this initiative.
Telecom Security Operation Centre
Operates in New Delhi, monitoring suspicious internet traffic in real time to detect and curb spam and scam activities.
AI-Powered Detection
Telecom companies like Airtel have adopted
Artificial Intelligence
to label suspicious calls as "Suspected Spam" and flag international calls, aiding users in identifying potential risks.
Effectiveness of Measures:
Successes
Reduction in spam communications from legitimate businesses complying with regulations.
Enhanced traceability of commercial messages through blockchain and sender ID systems.
Challenges
The dynamic nature of spam, with scammers constantly evolving tactics.
Rise in
and financial scams, especially from disposable numbers.
Difficulty in enforcing regulations on international spam traffic.
Way Forward:
To address the evolving nature of spam, TRAI and the government can adopt additional measures:
Strengthen VoIP Monitoring
Collaborate with global VoIP service providers to regulate and authenticate international traffic.
Public Reporting & Awareness Campaigns
Public participation through reporting tools like
remains essential in ensuring the success of these measures.
Educate users about reporting mechanisms and safe practices to avoid scams.
Expanded AI Integration
Scale up AI-based spam detection across all telecom providers for real-time monitoring and identification.
Stronger Penalties
Impose stricter penalties on violators to deter spam operations.

**********Supreme Court Emphasizes Sensitization in Abetment of Suicide Cases
Why in news?
The Supreme Court stressed the need to sensitize investigation agencies and courts regarding cases under
Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC)
, which deals with abetment of suicide.
A Bench comprising Justices Abhay S. Oka and K.V. Viswanathan highlighted that misuse of the provision should be avoided and called for adherence to legal principles laid down by the court.
The Bench emphasized that while genuine cases meeting the legal threshold should be prosecuted, the provision should not be misused to appease the grieving families of the deceased.
The remarks were made while acquitting a bank manager accused of abetting the suicide of a borrower who allegedly took his life due to an inability to repay loans. The court cautioned against baseless prosecutions that could lead to abuse of the legal process.
What’s in today’s article?
Abetment of Suicide in Criminal Law
Standard for Abetment of Suicide
Definition of Abetment
Under
Section 107 of the IPC
(equivalent to
Section 45 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023
), abetment involves:
Instigating a person to perform an act.
Conspiring with others to commit an act.
Intentionally aiding an act through action or illegal omission.
To prove abetment of suicide, it must be demonstrated that the accused directly instigated or aided the deceased in taking their life.
Punishment for Abetment of Suicide
Abetment of suicide is an offence tried in a Sessions court and is cognizable, non-bailable and non-compoundable in nature.
As per Section 306 of the IPC (equivalent to
Section 108 of the BNS
):
Imprisonment: Up to 10 years.
Fine: Additional monetary penalty.
Conviction Rates for Abetment of Suicide
According to the
National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)
2022 data:
Conviction rate for
Section 306 IPC
17.5%
Overall conviction rate for all IPC crimes:
69
8%
Conviction rate for cognizable offences (including abetment of suicide):
54.2%
This highlights a relatively low conviction rate for abetment of suicide compared to other crimes.
Supreme Court's October 2024 Judgment
The Supreme Court quashed a case of abetment of suicide where a salesperson died by suicide due to alleged workplace harassment related to a voluntary retirement scheme.
The court emphasized avoiding “unnecessary prosecutions” in workplace-related suicide cases.
The court highlighted that:
higher bar of proof
is required in cases where the relationship between the deceased and the accused is official (e.g., employer-employee).
Evidence must show the
accused intended to cause the suicide
The prosecution must demonstrate
direct and alarming incitement or encouragement
by the accused.
Supreme Court Precedents on Abetment of Suicide
M Mohan v. The State (2011)
Proof requires an active or direct act by the accused that leaves the deceased with no option but suicide.
The act must be intended to push the deceased into this position.
Ude Singh v. State of Haryana (2019)
There must be proof of direct or indirect incitement to the act of suicide.
However, if continuous acts or conduct by the accused create a situation where the deceased sees no other option, it may fall under Section 306 IPC.

**********Trust route booms after electoral bond ban
Why in news?
As per the electoral trust contribution reports released by the Election Commission of India (ECI), donations to political parties saw a significant increase through
electoral trusts
after the Supreme Court’s decision to scrap
electoral bonds
in February 2024.
What’s in today’s article?
What are Electoral trusts?
Benefits of Electoral Trusts Over Electoral Bonds
Surge in Donations to Political Parties Through Electoral Trusts
About
Electoral trusts are non-profit organizations created to facilitate transparent political funding in India.
They act as intermediaries, collecting voluntary contributions from individuals or companies and distributing them to registered political parties.
Companies which can establish electoral trusts
Any company
registered under section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956
, can seek approval to form an electoral trust.
Creation
The concept was introduced under the Income Tax Act, 1961, through Section 13B, which provides tax benefits to donors.
The Election Commission of India (ECI) regulates electoral trusts, and their functioning is governed by the
Electoral Trusts Scheme, 2013
introduced by the Ministry of Finance.
Who Can Donate
Indian citizens.
Domestic companies registered under the Companies Act, 2013.
Donors are required to disclose their identity and the amount contributed.
Who Cannot Donate
Foreign companies or individuals.
Government companies.
Entities prohibited under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, such as trusts that receive foreign funds.
Issues
Transparency Concerns
: While trusts disclose the donors' names, the specific amounts donated to each political party are not publicly available.
Corporate Influence
: Large corporate donors dominate the trust system, raising concerns about undue political influence.
Inequitable Distribution
: A significant portion of the funds goes to ruling or major political parties, sidelining smaller ones.
Lack of Donor Diversity
: Contributions are primarily from a limited number of large corporations, leading to concentration of influence.
Transparency in Donations
Electoral trusts are legally required to disclose the
names of donors
and the amounts received to the ECI.
Electoral bonds, on the other hand, allow anonymous donations, making it difficult to trace the source of funds.
Accountability of Political Parties
Electoral trusts mandate disclosure of the contributions disbursed to political parties. This ensures that the public knows which party received how much funding.
Electoral bonds do not require such disclosures, limiting accountability.
Regulatory Oversight
Electoral trusts are governed by the Electoral Trusts Scheme, 2013, and their operations are closely monitored by the ECI, ensuring adherence to legal guidelines.
Electoral bonds are managed by banks, with little transparency about regulatory scrutiny.
Prevention of Foreign Influence
Electoral trusts prohibit foreign donations, reducing the risk of foreign interference in Indian politics.
Electoral bonds do not explicitly restrict foreign-controlled entities registered in India from purchasing bonds, raising concerns about foreign influence.
About the news
The Supreme Court's February 15, 2024, ruling to scrap the electoral bonds scheme led to a significant shift in corporate political donations, redirecting them to the electoral trust route.
Electoral Trust, the largest contributor, witnessed a sharp surge in donations during the subsequent months, highlighting a diversion of funds from bonds to trusts.
Transparency in Electoral Trusts vs Electoral Bonds
Unlike the anonymity of electoral bonds, trusts are required to disclose donor names and amounts distributed to political parties.
However
, the exact allocation of individual corporate contributions to specific parties is not revealed

**********What did the ILO report state about international migrants?
IOCR
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
International Migrants;
Why in the News?
According to the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Global Estimates on International Migrant Workers, released in Geneva, the global population of international migrants reached 284.5 million in 2022, with 255.7 million of them being of working age (15 and older).
Why are there more male international migrants in the global labour force than women?
Gender Roles and Norms:
Traditional gender roles and societal norms often restrict women’s ability to migrate autonomously. Women are frequently expected to prioritize family responsibilities, which limits their opportunities for international migration and labor market participation.
Labour Market Segmentation:
Women are often concentrated in specific sectors such as domestic work, caregiving, and low-skilled service jobs, which are undervalued and less visible.
Men, on the other hand, dominate higher-paying sectors like construction and agriculture, which are more open to international migrants.
Barriers to Employment:
As per ILO, Migrant women face higher unemployment rates (8.7%) compared to migrant men (6.2%), due to factors such as language barriers, unrecognised qualifications, limited childcare options, and gender-based discrimination in host countries.
Economic and Social Independence:
Women’s migration decisions are influenced by their access to resources and social networks. A lack of autonomy or financial independence can hinder their ability to migrate for work.
In some cases, women migrate as dependents or spouses of male workers, which limits their access to legal employment opportunities in the host country.
Which are the countries that have absorbed the most international migrant workers?
Approximately 68.4% of international migrants are concentrated in high-income countries
followed by 17.4% (29.2 million) in upper-middle-income countries.
United States:
Historically a leading destination for migrants, the U.S. continues to host a large number of international workers despite recent declines in inflow.
Germany:
As one of the largest economies in Europe, Germany has seen a steady increase in migrant workers, particularly in sectors facing labour shortages.
United Kingdom:
The UK has experienced a significant rise in migrant workers, especially post-Brexit, with a notable increase in 2023.
Canada:
Known for its welcoming immigration policies, Canada has absorbed a substantial number of migrants, reflecting its need for labour in various sectors.
Australia:
Australia continues to attract migrants due to its strong economy and quality of life, with significant increases noted recently.
Which economic sectors attract IMs?
Construction:
The construction industry employs a significant number of male migrants, particularly in regions with rapid urbanisation and infrastructure projects. This sector, part of the 35.6% of male migrant employment in industry, plays a vital role in economic expansion.
Agriculture:
Globally, 7.1% of international migrants work in agriculture, with higher figures in regions like Africa, where 27.5% are employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Migrants are crucial for meeting seasonal labour demands.
Manufacturing:
Manufacturing heavily relies on migrant workers in industrialized nations, with migrants filling manual labour and skill-specific roles. This sector highlights the alignment of migrant labour with economic development needs.
Services Sector:
Approximately 68.4% of international migrants are employed in the services sector, compared to 51.5% of non-migrants. This sector includes a wide range of occupations, but it is particularly noted for:
Care Work:
A significant number of migrant women are employed in caregiving roles, which include healthcare and domestic services. About 28.8% of migrant women work in the care economy.
Hospitality and Retail:
Many migrants find employment in hotels, restaurants, and retail stores, especially in high-demand tourist areas.
Which are the main host countries?
Regional Distribution of Migrant Workers (2022)
: International migrants in the labour force were primarily concentrated in Europe and Central Asia (34.5%, 57.8 million), followed by the Americas (27.3%, 45.8 million), Asia and the Pacific (16.2%, 27.2 million), the Arab States (13.5%, 22.6 million), and Africa (8.5%, 14.3 million). The majority resided in Northern, Southern, and Western Europe (23.3%), Northern America (22.6%), and the Arab States (13.5%), collectively hosting 59.4% of all migrant workers.
Significant Proportions in Labor Forces
: Migrants formed more than one-third (37.2%) of the Arab States’ labour force. Significant proportions were also observed in Europe and Central Asia (12.9%) and the Americas (9%), highlighting their vital role in these economies.
Conclusion:
Governments and international organizations should implement gender-responsive migration policies that address barriers faced by women. This includes creating support systems for childcare, recognizing foreign qualifications, and ensuring equal access to legal employment opportunities in host countries.

The Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2021 shows that India’s fertility rate has dropped significantly, from 6.18 children per woman in the 1950s to 1.9 children per woman in 2021.
What has a GBD Report shown about the total fertility rate in India?
Declining Fertility Rates:
India’s TFR has dramatically decreased from 6.18 in the 1950s to 1.9 in 2021, which is below the replacement level of 2.1 necessary for population stability.
Future Projections:
The report projects that India’s TFR could further decline to 1.04 by 2100, indicating a potential average of less than one child per woman.
Socio-Economic Concerns:
This steep decline in fertility has raised alarms regarding political and socio-economic impacts, particularly in southern states, where there are fears of losing parliamentary representation due to demographic shifts post-delimitation in 2026.
Early Adoption of Family Planning Policies:
Southern states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh rigorously implemented family planning policies introduced in the 1950s, leading to a significant decline in fertility rates. For example, Andhra Pradesh currently has a Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 1.5, comparable to Nordic countries like Sweden.
Higher Female Literacy and Workforce Participation:
Increased educational attainment among women has empowered them to delay marriage and childbirth. This is evident in Kerala, where high literacy rates have contributed to the state achieving replacement-level fertility as early as 1988.
Changing Societal Norms:
Cultural shifts have led to late marriages and smaller families. For instance, women in southern states increasingly prioritize careers and financial independence over traditional roles, contributing to lower fertility rates.
Urbanization and Economic Pressures:
Urban lifestyles and rising costs of living discourage larger families. States like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have seen fertility rates drop to 1.4 and 1.6 respectively due to urbanization and modern aspirations.
Why are the southern States worried?
Ageing Population:
Southern states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh have fertility rates that have fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman. This decline leads to an increasing proportion of elderly individuals in the population, which is projected to rise significantly.
For instance, Kerala’s population aged 60 and above is expected to increase from 13% in 2011 to 23% by 2036. This demographic shift results in a smaller working-age population, which can strain economic productivity and increase demands for pensions and healthcare services.
Political Representation:
The upcoming delimitation of parliamentary constituencies, based on population figures from the 2031 Census, raises fears that southern states may lose parliamentary seats due to their slower population growth.
This potential reduction in representation could diminish their political influence at the national level, especially compared to more populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Economic Strain:
With a declining workforce contributing less to the economy through taxes and social security, southern states face challenges similar to those observed in countries with ageing populations, such as Japan and China.
Migration Issues:
As birth rates decline, southern states may increasingly rely on internal migration from northern states to fill labour shortages. However, this reliance could create further socio-economic disparities between regions.
Way forward:
Equitable Resource Distribution:
Implement policies ensuring equitable representation and resource allocation in parliamentary seats post-delimitation to address regional disparities without penalizing states with successful population control measures.
Support for Ageing Populations:
Develop robust social security systems, healthcare infrastructure, and incentives for elder care while promoting skill development and migration-friendly policies to mitigate workforce shortages in southern states.

**********Can Bhopal waste be safely disposed of?
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Hazardous waste;
Why in the News?
The Madhya Pradesh High Court gave authorities four weeks to dispose of the waste, nearly 40 years after the gas disaster that killed over 4,000 people and left thousands more injured or disabled.
What are the plans for the hazardous gas leak waste?
Waste Transportation:
The Madhya Pradesh government has successfully transported 358 tonnes of hazardous waste from the Union Carbide facility in Bhopal to the Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF) in Pithampur, Dhar district, following a court order.
Incineration Process:
The waste will be incinerated at the Pithampur facility, with an initial timeline of three to nine months for complete disposal, depending on emissions and safety assessments during the process.
Emission Controls:
To mitigate air pollution, the incinerator will utilize four-layer special filters to ensure that the smoke emitted does not contaminate the surrounding environment.
Post-Incineration Measures:
After incineration, the resulting ash will be covered with a two-layer membrane and buried in a landfill to prevent any contact with soil and water sources.
Expert Supervision:
The entire disposal process will be overseen by officials from the Central Pollution Control Board and State Pollution Control Board, ensuring compliance with safety regulations and environmental standards.
How much has been allocated to incinerate the waste and deposit the residue at a landfill in Pithampur?
The Central government has allocated ₹126 crore (approximately $15 million) to facilitate the incineration of this waste and ensure that any resulting residue is safely deposited in a landfill at the Pithampur facility.
Why have there been protests?
Health and Environmental Fears:
Residents are worried that the incineration of toxic waste will pose significant health risks and environmental hazards to the local population and surrounding areas, with claims that it could lead to harmful emissions affecting air quality.
Historical Context:
The protests are fueled by the legacy of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, which resulted in thousands of deaths and long-term health issues. This history has heightened sensitivity to any activities involving hazardous materials in the region.
Community Mobilization:
Local organizations, such as the
‘Pithampur Bachao Samiti’
, have organized bandhs (shutdowns) and demonstrations, leading to widespread participation from residents who are calling for the waste to be returned to Bhopal instead of being incinerated locally.
What is the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy?
The Bhopal gas tragedy, also known as the Bhopal disaster, occurred on the night of December 2-3, 1984, at the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India.
Chemical Leak:
The disaster was triggered by a leak of approximately 40 tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC), a highly toxic gas used in pesticide production. This gas escaped from a storage tank due to a combination of operational failures and safety deficiencies at the plant.
Immediate Impact:
The gas cloud spread over densely populated areas surrounding the plant, leading to immediate chaos and panic. Official estimates indicate that around 3,787 people died as a direct result of the gas exposure, while other estimates suggest that the death toll could be as high as 15,000 to 20,000 over subsequent years due to related health complications.
Injuries and Long-term Effects:
Over 558,000 individuals suffered injuries ranging from respiratory problems to permanent disabilities. Many survivors continue to experience health issues related to their exposure to the toxic gas.
Way forward:
Strengthen Public Engagement and Transparency
: Conduct comprehensive awareness campaigns involving scientific experts to address community concerns, ensuring transparent communication about safety measures, emission controls, and environmental safeguards during the incineration process.
Enhance Monitoring and Compliance
: Implement stringent real-time monitoring of emissions and groundwater quality during and after waste disposal, supervised by independent experts and regulatory bodies, to uphold environmental and public health standards.
Mains PYQ:
What are the impediments in disposing the huge quantities of discarded solid wastes which are continuously being generated? How do we remove safely the toxic wastes that have been accumulating in our habitable environment?
