Recently, two naturalists have spotted the saffron reedtail damselfly for the first time in Karnataka along the Netravati River.
About
Saffron Reedtail Damselfly:
It is referred to as
Indosticta deccanensis
and commonly called saffron reedtail because of the saffron bodies.
This particular species belongs to the
family Platystictidae
, commonly
referred to as shadow damselflies.

**********What is Geo-Economic Fragmentation?
The Economic Survey 2024-25 stated that global economic integration is backsliding, with geo-economic fragmentation replacing globalization, leading to a significant rise in trade restrictions.
About Geo-Economic Fragmentation:
‘Geo-economic fragmentation’ can be defined as a
policy-driven reversal of global economic integration
often
guided by strategic considerations.
It is characterized by
countries forming trade and financial partnerships based on geopolitical alignments.
This process encompasses different
channels, including trade, capital, and migration flows.
This trend, marked by a
retreat from multilateralism
, has made geography less relevant than geopolitics in trade and investment decisions.
Such fragmentation would
result in permanent losses to global GDP.
Based on IMF estimates, the costs of geoeconomic fragmentation can range from 0.2 percent to up to 7 percent of GDP in some economies.
These losses can emanate from
technological decoupling, trade restrictions, reduced capital movements
owing to higher risk aversion, and a
decline in international cooperation
in the provision of global public goods among economies.
Trade is the main channel
through which fragmentation is reshaping the global economy.
The impact of geo-economic fragmentation is seen in global
FDI flows
, which
are increasingly concentrated among geopolitically aligned countries,
particularly in strategic sectors.

**********What are Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs)?
The Economic Survey 2024-25 has called for stringent front-of-the-pack labelling rules to be enforced, adding that consumption of ultra-processed foods is a big factor in undermining physical and mental health.
About Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs):
UPFs refer to
food products
that have been
significantly altered from their original form
through various industrial processes.
These foods typically contain numerous ingredients that are not commonly used in home cooking, such as
artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, sweeteners,
emulsifiers, and other
additives
designed
to enhance flavor, texture, and shelf life
Consuming high amounts of UPF has been
linked to chronic health conditions
—cardiovascular disease, obesity, colorectal cancer, among others.
Characteristics of UPFS:
High levels of added sugar, fat, and salt:
These ingredients are often added to enhance taste and appeal, but they can contribute to various health issues, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.
Low nutritional value:
Despite being calorie-dense, UPFs generally lack essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
Extensive use of additives:
These foods often contain synthetic ingredients that are not typically found in traditional or minimally processed foods.
Highly palatable and convenient:
They are designed to be easy to consume and highly appealing, which can lead to overconsumption.
List of Foods Classified as UPF:
According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), UPFs include
commercially produced bread, breakfast cereals,
cakes, chips, biscuits, fries, jams,
sauces, mayonnaise,
commercially produced ice cream, protein packs powders, peanut butter, soy chunks, tofu,
frozen foods with additives,
commercially produced cheese, butter, paneer with additives, meats,
plant-based meats,
refined flours of cereals, millets and legumes
energy drinks,
health drinks added to milk
, beverages, and fruit juices.
The group also includes many culinary ingredients such as
cooking oils, refined sugars, salt and spices,
since cosmetic food additives such as artificial colours and emulsifiers are often used in their processing.

**********What is Financialisation?
The Economic Survey 2024-25 has warned that excessive financialisation can harm the economy, with potentially severe consequences for a low-middle-income country like India.
About Financialisation:
Financialization refers to the
increasing influence of financial motives, markets
, instruments, actors, and institutions
in both domestic and international economies
It involves the
growing dominance of finance tools in firm management
, the
impact of financial markets on decision-making
, and the significance of the global financial system in
capital distribution worldwide.
It represents the
shift from traditional industrial
or productive
activities
(like manufacturing)
to financial activities
that involve the trading, management, and speculation of financial assets.
transforms
the functioning of the
economic system at both the macro and micro levels.
Its
principal impacts
are
Elevate the significance of the financial sector relative to the real sector;
Transfer income from the real sector to the financial sector
Increase income inequality
and contribute to
wage stagnation
Financialization operates through three different conduits: changes in the structure and operation of financial markets, changes in the behavior of non-financial corporations, and changes in economic policy.

**********What are Microplastics?
A first-of-its-kind study commissioned by the Delhi government has detected microplastics in groundwater samples across the Capital.
About Microplastics:
Microplastics are
small pieces of plastics,
usually
smaller than 5 mm.
They are
persistent, very mobile
and hard to remove from nature.
There are
two categories
of microplastics: primary and secondary.
Primary microplastics

enter the environment directly
through any of various channels—for example, product use, unintentional loss from spills during manufacturing or transport, or abrasion during washing.
Secondary microplastics
are particles that
result from the breakdown of larger plastic items,
such as water bottles.
This
breakdown is caused by exposure to environmental factors
, mainly the sun’s radiation and ocean waves.
Impacts
Once in the environment, microplastics
do not biodegrade
and tend to a
ccumulate and persist.
They can be ingested by marine organisms, leading to potential
harm to aquatic life and bioaccumulation along the food chain.
They can also
carry toxic chemicals and pollutants
, posing additional risks to organisms and ecosystems.

**********Economic Survey 2024-25: A Blueprint for Growth and Innovation
Why in the News?
The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Preface of the Economic Survey 2024-25 in the Parliament.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Key Components of the Economic Survey
Background:
, tabled in Parliament by
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
, highlights
deregulation, strategic investments, artificial intelligence (AI), climate adaptation, and inclusive policies
as key pillars for economic growth.
The report underscores the need for
private-sector-led innovation, ease of doing business, and a shift in regulatory mindset
to propel India’s economy forward.
Deregulation as a Growth Stimulus:
The Survey advocates a
"Deregulation Stimulus"
, urging the government to
minimize bureaucratic red tape
and allow businesses to focus on innovation. It calls for:
Shifting from a
"guilty until proven innocent"
regulatory approach to a
trust-based system
Simplifying policies to make them more
transparent and accessible
Enabling businesses to
scale up without excessive compliance burdens
The Survey predicts that a
deregulation-driven economic environment
will help
unlock India’s demographic dividend
and sustain growth over the next two decades.
Boosting Strategic Investments for Economic Competitiveness:
With global trade growth slowing down, the Survey emphasizes
domestic and foreign investments
to maintain India’s economic momentum. It highlights:
Encouraging private sector investments
to strengthen domestic supply chains.
Attracting foreign capital
to enhance competitiveness.
Developing infrastructure and industrial ecosystems
to support long-term growth.
The Survey underscores that
domestic growth levers will play a more significant role
than external trade in the coming years.
Climate Change: Focus on Adaptation Over Mitigation
India’s energy transition strategy must prioritize
rather than just
emission reduction
, according to the Survey. Key recommendations include:
Diversifying energy sources
while balancing economic and environmental sustainability.
Expanding public transportation
as an efficient alternative to private electric mobility.
Avoiding over-reliance on imported resources
for energy security.
With India’s vast geography and resource constraints, the Survey argues that
localized adaptation strategies
will be more effective than global climate policies.
Artificial Intelligence: Driving India’s Tech Innovation
Recognizing AI’s potential, the Survey suggests:
Establishing
AI Centres of Excellence (CoE)
in top educational institutions.
Creating a
₹1 lakh crore financing corpus
to support AI research and private-sector innovation.
Acknowledging that AI may
not be a universal solution
for a labor-intensive economy like India.
The Survey promotes a
balanced approach to AI adoption
, ensuring
employment preservation
while leveraging automation for economic gains.
Health and Nutrition: Tackling Processed Food Consumption
The report raises concerns about the rising
consumption of ultra-processed foods (High in Fat, Salt, and Sugar - HFSS)
among Indian youth. It recommends:
Stricter front-of-pack labeling
to inform consumers.
Government regulations over self-regulation
in food standards.
Policies to promote healthier eating habits
and physical well-being.
The Survey emphasizes that
public health policies must align with economic growth strategies
to ensure a healthier workforce.
Inclusive Development: Women, Farmers, and Youth Empowerment
For
inclusive growth
, the Survey highlights:
Women’s Participation:
Removing legal and regulatory barriers to increase labor force participation.
Farmers’ Welfare:
Supporting income growth and agricultural modernization.
Youth Development:
Investing in education, skill-building, and mental health.
Poverty Reduction:
Advancing economic inclusion through targeted welfare programs.
The Survey calls
inclusive participation the litmus test
of effective economic policies.
Industrial Growth and Ease of Doing Business
The Survey identifies a
direct link between industrial activity and business-friendly policies
. It notes:
States with high "Ease of Doing Business" scores
have stronger industrial growth.
Aspiring states must improve industrial policies
to attract investments.
success of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme
in sectors like air-conditioner manufacturing proves the impact of government intervention.
The Survey suggests
expanding PLI incentives to other critical sectors
External Trade and Economic Challenges:
The Survey warns of
potential trade restrictions
that could impact India’s export growth. Key risks include:
Rising global protectionism
affecting market access.
Widening current account deficit
due to import dependencies.
Geopolitical uncertainties influencing trade agreements
To mitigate these risks, India must focus on
self-reliance in strategic sectors
expanding domestic consumption
Conclusion: Towards "Viksit Bharat 2047"
The Economic Survey 2024-25 presents a
bold vision
for India's growth, focusing on
deregulation, investment-driven expansion, AI innovation, climate adaptation, and inclusive development
By fostering a
trust-based business environment
, promoting
private sector-led growth
, and addressing
climate and social challenges

**********Four years on, Myanmar and Its Continuing Nightmare
Context
Myanmar, often referred to as
the sick man of Southeast Asia,
continues to suffer the consequences of the military coup that took place on February 1, 2021.
Four years later,
the country is deeply fragmented, with ongoing conflicts between the military junta and resistance forces.
Therefore, it is crucial to explore
the ongoing turmoil in Myanmar by analysing the military conflict, the role of regional organisations like ASEAN
, and the involvement of neighbouring countries.
The Military Conflict and Its Consequences
Since the coup,
Myanmar has been involved in an intense civil conflict
between the ruling military and various resistance groups, including ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and people’s defence forces (PDFs).
unrecognised National Unity Government (NUG) loosely coordinates these resistance groups,
but the war remains chaotic and fragmented.
The cost of the conflict has been devastating:
as of January 2025, over 28,000 people have been arrested, more than 6,200 have been killed
, and around 3.3 million have been internally displaced.
military junta has responded with brutal force
, employing indiscriminate attacks and unlawful killings that have been widely condemned by human rights organisations.
At the same time,
the resistance forces, though persistent, have been unable to claim outright victory.
Instead,
the country is now divided into three distinct zones
: the central region, which remains under military control; the peripheral areas, controlled by resistance forces; and contested civilian regions that frequently experience aerial bombardments and military offensives.
The Role of ASEAN and Reason Behind
ASEAN’s Limited Influence
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
was expected to play a leading role in resolving the crisis.
However, its diplomatic efforts
have largely failed.
After the coup,
ASEAN attempted to mediate the situation through its Five-Point Consensus (5PC),
which called for an end to violence, dialogue between conflicting parties, and humanitarian assistance.
the military junta has ignored these demands,
and ASEAN’s diplomatic efforts have proven ineffective.
A major reason for ASEAN’s failure is the
lack of unity among its member states
While some countries advocate for strong action against the junta,
others prioritise economic and strategic ties with Myanmar’s military rulers.
Recently, ASEAN foreign ministers advised the military government to prioritise dialogue
over holding elections, but the junta dismissed these suggestions.
inability of ASEAN to enforce its own resolutions has rendered it powerless
in the face of Myanmar’s crisis.
The Role of Neighbouring Countries: Limited Influence and Conflicting Interests
China’s Expanding Influence
China has emerged as the most influential external power
in Myanmar.
Unlike Western nations that have largely distanced themselves from Myanmar’s military rulers,
China has maintained diplomatic ties with the junta
while simultaneously engaging with resistance groups along the border.
China’s interests
in Myanmar are
primarily economic and strategic.
Myanmar plays a crucial role in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
providing access to the Indian Ocean through the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC).
This
corridor includes key infrastructure projects such as the Kyaukpyu deep-sea port
and an oil and gas pipeline that connects Myanmar’s west coast to China’s Yunnan province.
These projects allow China to reduce its reliance on the Malacca Strait
for energy imports, making Myanmar a vital component of its regional strategy.
India’s Dilemma: Balancing Security and Democracy
On one hand,
India has traditionally supported democracy in Myanmar
and has maintained good relations with Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD).
On the other hand,
India has security concerns along its northeastern border
, which it shares with Myanmar.
Several insurgent groups operating in India’s northeastern states
, such as the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN),
have historically used Myanmar’s territory as a safe haven.
This has made
New Delhi reluctant to completely sever ties with Myanmar’s military rulers
, as the junta has occasionally cooperated in cracking down on these insurgents.
Additionally,
India has strategic and economic interests in Myanmar,
particularly through projects like the
Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project
, which aims to connect India’s northeastern states to Myanmar’s Sittwe port.
with large parts of Myanmar now controlled by resistance groups, India’s access to these projects is increasingly uncertain.
Thailand: A Key Player with Limited Influence
As Myanmar’s western neighbour and a member of ASEAN,
Thailand is uniquely positioned to play a significant role in the crisis.
It shares a long border with Myanmar and
has a history of economic and security cooperation with the country.
Thailand has been directly affected by Myanmar’s instability, as
refugees continue to cross into Thai territory to escape the violence.
Despite these factors,
Thailand’s influence over Myanmar is constrained by its own political dynamics.
Bangladesh and Laos: Limited Leverage
Unlike China, India, or Thailand,
Bangladesh lacks significant economic or strategic leverage over Myanmar.
It has engaged in diplomatic talks with the junta but
has been unable to secure meaningful commitments regarding the Rohingya issue.
Moreover,
the recent conflicts in Myanmar’s Rakhine State have raised concerns that more Rohingya refugees may flee to Bangladesh
, further exacerbating the crisis.
, Myanmar’s least influential neighbour,
has largely remained on the sidelines.
As a small, landlocked country with limited regional influence,
Laos has neither the political nor economic power to impact Myanmar’s internal affairs.
Its response has been in line with ASEAN’s broader approach, which has so far been ineffective.
Conclusion
As the world turns its attention to other global crises,
Myanmar’s suffering continues largely unnoticed.
If their leaders, both within the military and the resistance, fail to engage in meaningful dialogue,
the country will remain trapped in a cycle of violence and instability.
Ultimately,
the only way forward for Myanmar lies in internal reconciliation, rather than relying on foreign actors
who have repeatedly shown their inability or unwillingness to help.

Editorial Analysis
**********A Note for New Delhi on Dealing with ‘Trumperica’
Context
The
inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States marked a dramatic shift in American policy,
characterised by sweeping executive orders, stringent immigration measures, aggressive trade policies, and a focus on artificial intelligence (AI).
While these policies align with Trump’s vision of ‘America First,’
they have profound implications for global geopolitics, particularly for India.
trajectory of U.S.-India relations
, which had been on an upward trend for over two decades,
now faces challenges that require careful diplomatic navigation.
Immigration Crackdown and Its Repercussions
Mass Deportations and Economic Consequences
Trump’s administration has taken
a hardline approach to deporting illegal immigrants
, a move that will affect a significant number of Indians.
According to Pew Research estimates, around 725,000 Indians are undocumented in the U.S
., making them one of the largest immigrant groups at risk of deportation.
Additionally,
more than 18,000 Indians are currently in detention centres
, awaiting removal.
If the Trump administration escalates deportation flights
, as it did in its first term,
India will face multiple economic and social challenges.
Repercussions on India
Loss of Remittances
India will lose a substantial source of remittances
, as many undocumented immigrants send money back home to support their families.
Remittances form an essential part of India’s foreign exchange reserves
, contributing to the country’s economic stability.
sudden decline in these inflows could impact household incomes
and increase financial distress in many communities.
Employment Challenges for Deported Individuals
return of thousands of deported individuals
will add pressure to India’s already-strained job market.
With unemployment rates fluctuating and job creation still a challenge,
reintegrating a large number of returnees will require significant policy interventions,
including skill development programs and economic reintegration strategies.
Many of these deportees, having lived in the U.S. for years, may struggle to adjust to the Indian job market
, where opportunities, salaries, and working conditions are vastly different.
Economic Effect
use of economic coercion to enforce compliance on immigration policies
is a growing concern.
His administration has already demonstrated a
willingness to impose heavy tariffs on countries that refuse to accept deported nationals.
For instance,
Colombia faced a 25% tariff threat unless it agreed to accept deportations
without conditions.
If India resists accepting deportees, it may face similar economic consequences
, potentially leading to higher tariffs on Indian exports or restrictions on trade agreements.
Impact on Indian Students and the Education Sector
Another area of concern is
Trump’s hostile stance towards international students.
U.S. is the most popular destination for Indian students
pursuing higher education, particularly in STEM fields.
Many of these students hope to
transition to H-1B visas and settle in the U.S.
However,
with increasing visa restrictions and uncertainties surrounding Optional Practical Training (OPT) programs
, the attractiveness of U.S. universities may decline.
As a result,
India might see a decline in student enrolments in American institutions
, impacting both students and U.S. universities, which benefit from international tuition fees.
Trade Policies and the Weaponization of Tariffs
Trump’s trade policies,
centred on the ‘America First’
doctrine, pose another major challenge for India.
administration has demonstrated a willingness to leverage tariffs as a tool of economic coercion
, as seen in his threats to impose heavy tariffs on countries that resist U.S. immigration policies.
In his first term,
India quietly accepted the withdrawal of its Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) status,
which had granted tariff-free access to many Indian exports.
A continuation of such policies in Trump’s second term could
further strain India’s trade relationship with the U.S.
Moreover,
Trump’s unpredictable stance on China complicates matters for India.
While he has threatened tariffs on Chinese goods,
his conciliatory gestures towards President Xi Jinping and a softer-than-expected tariff policy suggest a potential shift
towards U.S.-China cooperation.
If such a shift materialises, it could disrupt India’s economic strategy, which has been geared towards capitalising on U.S.-China tensions
to attract investments and strengthen its own manufacturing sector.
The AI Disruption and Its Impact on Indian IT Professionals
Perhaps the most far-reaching economic consequence of Trump’s second term is his
aggressive push for artificial intelligence development.
$500 billion Stargate AI Infrastructure project signals the U.S.’s intent to dominate the AI
landscape, potentially at the expense of foreign tech workers.
By advancing AI capabilities,
Trump’s administration aims to reduce dependence on human labour, including the Indian IT professionals
who have long formed the backbone of Silicon Valley’s workforce.
The shift towards AI-driven automation poses
a dual threat to India.
it could limit employment opportunities for Indian software engineers
and tech professionals in the U.S.
Second,
if U.S. companies begin replacing human workers with AI-generated code, India’s IT-BPM sector,
which contributes significantly to its GDP and exports,
may face an existential challenge.
Industry leaders like
Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg have already indicated that AI-generated code is becoming increasingly prevalent
, raising concerns about job security in the tech industry.
The Way Forward for India to Deal with Trumperica
While the symbolic aspects of the U.S.-India relationship remain strong,
the economic realities suggest a more cautious approach.
India must engage in proactive diplomacy
to mitigate the effects of restrictive immigration policies, protect its trade interests against tariff threats, and prepare for the disruptive impact of AI on its workforce.
Expanding job opportunities at home
: With skilled professionals facing difficulties in the U.S., India must strengthen its startup ecosystem, technology sector, and manufacturing industries to absorb returning talent.
Reforming higher education
: India should enhance the quality of STEM education and research opportunities to ensure that students who cannot go abroad still have world-class educational prospects.
Strengthening diplomatic efforts
: India must negotiate with the U.S. to secure better visa policies, especially for skilled professionals, students, and family reunifications.
Conclusion
Trump’s policies present India with a complex set of challenges
that span immigration, trade, and technology.
As New Delhi prepares for high-level engagements with Washington,
it must prioritise strategic economic planning to navigate these evolving dynamics.
The era of Trumperica demands not only diplomatic finesse but also robust domestic policies
to safeguard India’s economic future in an increasingly uncertain global landscape.

_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
There are several significant developments surrounding the
ongoing crisis in Myanmar
as it marks the fourth anniversary of the military coup.
What has been the impact of the military coup on Myanmar’s political landscape?
The military coup in Myanmar on February 1, 2021, has drastically altered the political landscape, leading to instability and conflict.
Return to Military Rule:
The coup reversed a decade-long democratic transition by overthrowing the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD), resulting in widespread protests and civil unrest against the junta.
Rise in Civil Unrest and Resistance:
The coup sparked massive protests and a civil disobedience movement, leading to the formation of a shadow government, the National Unity Government (NUG), by ousted lawmakers.
This has resulted in armed conflict with various ethnic groups and newly formed resistance forces, creating a state of civil war.
Human Rights Violations and Humanitarian Crisis:
The military’s brutal crackdowns have led to widespread human rights abuses, including killings and arbitrary detentions. Millions have been displaced, exacerbating existing ethnic conflicts, particularly affecting the Rohingya population. The international response has largely failed to hold the military accountable.
What are the prospects for Myanmar’s economy in 2025 considering the current socio political turmoil?
forecasts a 1% contraction in Myanmar’s GDP for the fiscal year ending in March 2025, marking a significant downgrade from earlier growth expectations.
By 2025, around 19.9 million people—one-third of the population—are expected to require humanitarian aid, including 6.3 million children.
Since the military coup in February 2021,
armed conflicts and natural disasters
have disrupted production across sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. Recent floods have further damaged infrastructure.
About 25% of the population faces
acute food insecurity
, driven by high inflation rates projected at 26% annually. Many households struggle to afford basic necessities due to rising food prices.
long-term economic outlook
remains grim, with subdued growth expected even if conflict levels stabilize. Further violence or natural disasters could worsen economic conditions.
How has the role of ASEAN evolved in addressing the Myanmar crisis?
Five-Point Consensus:
In April 2021, ASEAN introduced a Five-Point Consensus calling for an end to violence, dialogue, humanitarian aid, and a special envoy to mediate. However, its effectiveness has been limited due to lack of inclusivity and pressure on the military junta.
Trioka Mechanism:
ASEAN created the Trioka Mechanism to monitor the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus. This group includes Indonesia, Laos, and Malaysia but faces concerns about its ability to address Myanmar’s complex issues.
Humanitarian Response:
ASEAN has held meetings to improve humanitarian aid delivery but struggles with implementation challenges.
International Engagement:
External influences, like those from the
EU
UN,
have shaped ASEAN’s approach. Critics argue that ASEAN’s preference for dialogue over sanctions has not produced significant results.
Way Forward:
have struggled to resolve the Myanmar crisis, prompting experts to call on neighboring countries—
China, India, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Laos
—to take action, as the situation threatens their interests.
However, challenges persist: borders with India and Bangladesh are controlled by
ethnic armed organizations (EAOs)
, trust issues exist between I
ndia and China
India-Bangladesh
relations are strained.
This makes it difficult for these nations to reach a consensus on how to encourage peace.
as a significant ASEAN member, could play a crucial role but faces its own limitations.
Meanwhile,
China’s influence
has grown since the coup, and experts suggest that Myanmar’s people should not rely on external help; instead, their leaders must prioritize dialogue over violence to avoid further suffering.
**********A pragmatic picture: Economic Survey
Mains Paper 3
Why in the News?
The Budget session of Parliament has started at a time when India’s economic situation is shifting. After four years of strong growth following the pandemic, the economy is slowing down.
What are the key projections for India’s economic growth in FY 2024-25?
Projected GDP Growth:
The National Statistical Office (NSO) has estimated that India’s GDP will grow by 6.4% in FY 2024-25. This figure marks a decline from the 8.2% growth recorded in FY 2023-24 and is lower than earlier forecasts which ranged from 6.5% to 7%.
Sectoral Performance:
The slowdown is attributed to weaker performance in sectors such as manufacturing and services. The first half of FY 2024-25 is expected to see a growth rate of around 6%, necessitating a stronger performance of 6.8% in the second half to meet the annual target.
Comparative Estimates:
While the NSO’s estimate stands at 6.4%, other organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have projected a slightly higher growth rate of 7%, reflecting differing outlooks on economic recovery and consumer demand.
How does the Economic Survey address challenges such as inflation and global uncertainties?
Food Inflation Concerns:
Despite the overall decline in inflation, food inflation remains a challenge, rising from 7.5% in FY24 to 8.4% in the same period due to supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions.
The survey emphasizes the need for improved agricultural practices and climate-resilient crops to manage these risks effectively.
Inflation Trends:
The survey reports a reduction in retail inflation from 5.4% in FY24 to 4.9% during April-December 2024, indicating a positive trend towards achieving the RBI’s target of around 4% by FY26, contingent on stable global commodity prices and favorable domestic agricultural output.
Global Economic Uncertainties:
The survey highlights that ongoing geopolitical tensions and global trade risks pose significant challenges to inflation management, necessitating careful policy interventions to mitigate potential impacts on the domestic economy.
Policy Recommendations:
To address these challenges, the Economic Survey advocates for strategic policy measures, including enhancing supply chain resilience, improving data collection for better price monitoring, and fostering an environment conducive to investment and growth.
What structural reforms are recommended to enhance long-term economic stability?
Deregulation and Ease of Doing Business:
The Economic Survey advocates for significant deregulation to foster a more conducive business environment. It stresses that the government should “get out of the way” of businesses by minimizing micro-management and enhancing accountability among regulators.
Empowering Small Firms:
Recommendations include empowering small enterprises, enhancing economic freedom, and ensuring a level playing field across sectors to stimulate growth and investment.
Focus on Domestic Demand:
The budget is expected to prioritize boosting domestic demand through increased government spending, particularly in infrastructure and capital projects, as a countermeasure against global uncertainties and inflationary pressures.
Way forward:
Strengthen Domestic Resilience
– Focus on boosting domestic consumption and investment through targeted fiscal measures, infrastructure expansion, and support for MSMEs to counter global uncertainties.
Enhance Inflation Management
– Implement climate-resilient agricultural policies, improve supply chain efficiency, and strengthen monetary-fiscal coordination to maintain stable inflation and ensure sustainable growth.
Mains PYQ:
Is inclusive growth possible under market economy? State the significance of financial inclusion in achieving economic growth in India.

**********India is heading into a middle income trap
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Middle-income trap;
Why in the News?
Ahead of the Union Budget, the Congress released a report on January 30, 2025, saying that India is at risk of getting stuck in the
middle-income trap
.
What is the classification of Countries given by the World Bank?
The World Bank classifies countries into four income groups based on their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.
Low-Income Countries:
These are nations with a GNI per capita of $1,145 or less. This group typically includes countries facing significant economic challenges and lower levels of development.
Lower-Middle-Income Countries:
Countries in this category have a GNI per capita ranging from $1,146 to $4,515. This group often includes emerging economies that are in the process of development but still face various socio-economic issues.
Upper-Middle-Income Countries:
This classification includes countries with a GNI per capita between $4,516 and $14,005. These nations generally have more developed economies and better infrastructure compared to lower-middle-income countries.
High-Income Countries:
These are countries with a GNI per capita exceeding $14,005. This group includes the most developed economies with high standards of living and advanced infrastructure.
What factors contribute to India being at risk of falling into a middle-income trap?
Low GDP Growth:
India’s projected GDP growth rate for 2024-25 is around 6.4%, significantly lower than the 8% needed to leverage its demographic dividend effectively, indicating a slowdown in economic momentum.
Food Inflation Concerns:
Despite the overall decline in inflation, food inflation remains a challenge, rising from 7.5% in FY24 to 8.4% in the same period due to supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions.
Private Sector Investment:
Despite corporate tax cuts, private sector investment has not significantly increased. The Economic Survey 2024-25 indicates that Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), a crucial indicator of investment activity, slowed to 5.4% in the recent quarter, reflecting a decline in private capital expenditure.
Government Capital Expenditure:
The survey notes that government capital expenditure utilization was only 37.3% in the first half of FY25, down from 49% the previous year, which has contributed to the overall slowdown in investments.
Low Incomes:
A significant portion of India’s population lives on extremely low incomes, with estimates suggesting that about 50% of the population earns between ₹100 and ₹150 per day. This level of income severely limits consumer spending capacity and economic growth potential.
How does the current economic policy framework address the challenges? (Way forward)
Next-Generation Reforms:
The Union Budget 2024-25 emphasizes “Next Generation Reforms” aimed at enhancing productivity and market efficiency across various sectors.
This includes a comprehensive Economic Policy Framework that focuses on improving factors of production land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship while leveraging technology to reduce inequality and boost economic growth.
Deregulation and Economic Freedom:
The Economic Survey highlights the need for deregulation and grassroots reforms to enhance the competitiveness of the economy. It advocates for greater economic freedom, allowing individuals and organizations to pursue legitimate economic activities without excessive regulatory burdens.
Public-Private Partnerships and Infrastructure Investment:
The framework encourages public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure projects, facilitating greater collaboration between the government and private sector.
By removing policy hurdles and providing upfront support for long-term projects, the government aims to attract patient capital necessary for sustainable development, which is critical for addressing current economic challenges

**********Supreme Court (SC) bans Manual Scavenging in 6 cities in a writ petition
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Social Problem; Manual scavenging;
Why in the News?
Recently, the Supreme Court ordered a complete ban on manual scavenging and unsafe cleaning of sewers and septic tanks in major cities across India.
What measures will be implemented to ensure compliance with the ban?
Affidavit Submission:
The court has directed the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of the six metropolitan cities—
Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru,
Hyderabad
to file detailed affidavits by February 13, 2025.
These affidavits must outline how and when manual scavenging and sewer cleaning will cease in their respective cities.
Monitoring Progress:
The court is actively monitoring compliance with its previous judgments, particularly the one from October 2023, which mandated actions to eliminate manual scavenging practices.
Implementation of Technology:
The court noted that modern machinery and technology are available for sewer cleaning, suggesting that human involvement should no longer be necessary.
Why is Manual scavenging banned in India?
Severe Health Risks:
Manual scavengers are exposed to hazardous conditions that pose significant health risks, including exposure to harmful pathogens and toxic gases. This can lead to a range of serious health issues, such as respiratory problems, gastrointestinal diseases, and skin infections.
Social Stigma and Discrimination:
Individuals engaged in manual scavenging often face severe social stigma and discrimination due to the nature of their work, which is viewed as “unclean” and tied to lower castes in the Indian caste system.
This stigma affects not only the workers but also their families, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting access to education and better employment opportunities for their children.
What consequences will officials face for failing to comply with the court’s order?
Judicial Displeasure:
The court expressed frustration over past non-compliance with its orders, indicating that failure to adhere to this latest directive could lead to serious repercussions. The justices stated, “Either do it or face consequences,” emphasizing their determination to enforce compliance.
Potential Legal Action:
While specific penalties were not outlined in this order, the strong language used by the court suggests that further legal action could be pursued against officials who fail to comply with the ban on manual scavenging and sewer cleaning.

**********Cannabis Cultivation in India
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Legal status of Cannabis
Why in the News?
The Himachal Pradesh Cabinet has approved a pilot study for the controlled cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and industrial purposes.
Legal Status of Cannabis Cultivation in India:
Prohibited for recreational use
under the
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985
Section 2
of the NDPS Act bans the
cultivation, production, and sale
of cannabis resin and flowers.
Section 10
allows
state governments
to regulate cannabis cultivation for
medicinal and scientific purposes
Section 14
grants the
Central Government
authority to permit cultivation for
industrial uses (fiber and seed extraction)
Why Himachal Pradesh Could Soon Allow Controlled Cannabis Cultivation?
Himalayan region’s soil and climate
are ideal for cultivating
low-THC hemp varieties
, making Himachal Pradesh a prime location for controlled cannabis farming.
The government sees controlled cultivation as a way to
generate revenue
, create
employment opportunities
, and support
local farmers
, particularly in
Kullu, Chamba, Mandi, Solan, Kangra, and Sirmaur
Cannabis cultivation will be
restricted to industrial and pharmaceutical uses
, such as:
Pain relief medications
Textile and paper production
Biofuel and cosmetics
Hemp-based food products
Kullu and Malana regions
are known for
illegal narcotic cannabis cultivation
. Regulating the sector could
reduce illegal activities and ensure legal trade
permit and regulate
scientific, medicinal, and industrial
purposes under
strict conditions
Which are the other States to allow Controlled Cannabis Cultivation in India?
