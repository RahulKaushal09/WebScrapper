Source: IE
Why in News?
Recently, a devastating fire broke out in an apartment building near Kuwait City, resulting in the tragic loss of at least 49 lives, with around 40 of the victims being Indian nationals.
The apartment building housed over 195 workers, the majority of whom were Indian nationals hailing from the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and various parts of northern India.
What is the Current State of Workers in the Gulf Region?
Evolution of Indian community in Kuwait:
1990-1991 Gulf War
has led to a mass exodus of the Indian community from Kuwait. After Kuwait's liberation, most members of the Indian community gradually returned and became the largest expatriate community in Kuwait.
Prior to the liberation war, the Palestinians constituted the largest expatriate community in Kuwait.
"Kuwait's liberation"
refers to the
military operations in 1991 that resulted in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait
. This event marked the end of the Gulf War, when a coalition led by the United States launched a military campaign to free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. The successful liberation of Kuwait restored the country's sovereignty and independence.
Indians in Gulf Countries:
According to data from the Government of India, as of 2021, there were approximately
8.9 million Indian migrants
residing in the Gulf countries.
25%
overseas Indians
56%
NRI
reside in 6 Gulf countries (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain).
NRIs (Non-Resident Indians)
are individuals who hold Indian citizenship but live outside of India.
Overseas Indians or Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs)
are individuals from foreign countries with
ancestral ties to India
. They are
not considered Indian citizens
but are granted specific privileges akin to those of permanent residents in India.
Inward Remittances:
Of the total foreign inward remittances,
28.6%
originated from the
alone accounting for
2.4%
of these remittances.
Trade Relations
The gulf region contributes to about
one-sixth
of India’s total trade.
In FY 2022-23, India’s trade with GCC countries stood at around
USD 184 billion
, marking a
20% increase
as compared to FY 2021-22.
Partnership in Energy Cooperation:
The Government of India has announced plans to develop a comprehensive relationship with the GCC countries in the area of
energy cooperation
This will involve encouraging
participation in India’s strategic petroleum reserves, negotiating long-term gas supply agreements, seeking concessions in oilfields
, and collaborating on
renewable energy projects
What are the Challenges Faced by Indian Diaspora and Migrants in Gulf Countries?
Kafala System:
It is a practice of
tying a migrant worker's visa to their employer
(sponsor). It is prevalent in many Gulf countries. This creates a
power imbalance and misery to
workers who face  issues like confiscation of passports, difficulty changing jobs and exploitation and abuse by their employer. This has led to
forced labour
situations.
Security Concerns:
In 2014, during the insurgency in Iraq, 40 Indian construction workers were abducted and killed by the
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)
which highlights the potential security risks faced by Indian workers in volatile regions.
Unsafe Working Conditions and Labor Exploitation:
Migrant workers, particularly in construction and manual labour sectors, often face
unsafe working environments with inadequate safety gea
and protocols. This can lead to accidents, injuries, and even fatalities.
In 2019,several Indian workers died due to
heatstroke
in the UAE, highlighting the dangers of working in extreme heat without proper precautions.
They also
face issues regarding non-payment of salaries, denial of overtime pay
, and longer working hours.
Limited Rights and Abuse:
Indian expatriates are
not granted citizenship or permanent residency
in most Gulf countries which
restricts their ability to own property, access social security benefits, and participate in political processes.
Domestic workers are vulnerable to
physical and psychological abuse
by employers.
What  are the Measures taken by the Indian Government to Protect its Migrant Workers Abroad?
Bilateral Labour Agreements (BLAs)
: The government has signed BLAs with several countries
to ensure the protection and welfare of Indian migrant workers
. These agreements
cover aspects like minimum wages, working conditions
, repatriation, and dispute resolution.
Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana (PBBY):
This is a
mandatory insurance scheme
that provides life and disability cover to all
Emigration Check Required (ECR)
category Indian migrant workers going abroad for employment.
It provides coverage of up to
Rs. 10 lakh in case of accidental death or permanent disability
of Indian migrant workers abroad.
Minimum Referral Wages (MRW):
MRW  has been set by the Indian Government for Indian migrant workers abroad in nations that
do not have minimum wage laws
It ranges around USD 300 to 600.
It is the
lowest acceptable salary
set by the Indian government for its migrant workers (especially unskilled) going to specific countries.
It ensures migrant workers from India receive a minimum salary in certain countries.
prevents them from being exploited
by employers offering much lower wages than the norm.
The MRW rates are
advised by Indian missions in the destination countries,
considering the prevailing cost of living and wage rates prescribed by the relevant ministries. During the
Covid-19
pandemic, it was briefly lowered to protect Indian worker's jobs in the Gulf.
eMigrate System:
This is an online platform that
streamlines the emigration process
. It provides
pre-departure orientation, registers job contracts,
and tracks the status of migrant workers.
Migrant Resource Centers:
Set up in several states to provide information, counselling, and support services to prospective and returning migrant workers.
Grievance Redressal Mechanisms:
Platforms like the eMigrate system and the Overseas Workers Resource Centre allow migrant workers to file complaints and seek assistance from the government.
Repatriation Assistance:
In cases of distress or conflict, the
Indian government provides repatriation assistance to Indian workers abroad
, facilitating their safe return to India.
Restrictions on Women's Emigration:
below the age of 30 years are not granted emigrant clearance
for employment as housemaid, domestic worker, hairdresser, beautician, dancer, stage artist, labourers, or general workers.
Drishti Mains Question:
Discuss the challenges faced by Indian workers employed in other countries, and analyse the measures taken by the Government of India to address their issues and protect their interests.

Zero-Draft of Pandemic Treaty
Why in News?
Recently, the
World Health Organization’s (WHO)
has published a
‘Zero-Draft’ of the Pandemic Treaty
, aiming to bring in Global and National-Level
Pandemic Preparedness.
The treaty aims to
address the challenges posed by pandemics and other global health emergencies.
The zero-draft of the pandemic treaty was established based on recognising the catastrophic failure of the international community in showing solidarity and equity in response to the
Covid-19 Pandemic.
What are the Principal Components of the Draft?
Global Cooperation:
It calls for
increased global coordination and cooperation
in the preparation for and response to pandemics and
Strengthening of Health Systems:
It emphasizes the
need to strengthen health systems in all countries
, particularly in
low- and middle-income countries
, to ensure they are better prepared to respond to pandemics and other global health emergencies.
Investment in Research and Development:
improved access to essential health technologies,
such as
vaccines
, diagnostics, and treatments, during pandemics and other global health emergencies.
increased investment in research and development
of health technologies, particularly for diseases that pose a significant threat to global health.
Transparency in Sharing of Information:
increased transparency and sharing of information about pandemics
and other global health emergencies, including data on the spread of diseases and the effectiveness of interventions.
Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System:
The constitution of a PABS has been constituted under the WHO, making Genomic sequences of all pathogens with pandemic potential to
be shared on an “equal footing” in the system.
The PABS system is an important tool for ensuring the responsible and equitable use of pathogens and their genetic resources in the research and development
of new medicines and vaccines
, while also recognizing the rights and interests of the countries and communities that provide these resources.
Addressing Gender Disparities:
In addressing gender disparities in the healthcare workforce, the draft aims to
“ensure meaningful representation
, engagement, participation and empowerment of all health and care workers” by stressing equal pay and addressing barriers specific to women in taking leadership roles.
What is the Existing Framework for Global Health Cooperation?
International Health Regulations
(IHR), is an instrument of international law that is
legally-binding on 196 countries
including India.
It aims for international collaboration to prevent, protect against, control, and provide a
public health response to the international spread of disease.
It provides an overarching legal framework that defines countries’ rights and obligations in handling public health events and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders.
IHR empowers the WHO to act as the main global surveillance system. The Regulations also outline the criteria to determine whether or not a particular event constitutes a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
What are the Challenges to the Healthcare Sector Globally?
Lack of Access to Healthcare:
Despite advances in medical technology,
many populations around the world still lack access
to basic healthcare services, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
As populations around the world age, there is
increasing demand for long-term care services
, which are often expensive and not covered by traditional health insurance.
Healthcare Infrastructure:
Public health data and infrastructure are fragmented and lacking any global standard causing a
major concern regarding quality and reliability of existing healthcare systems.
Besides that, a large part of hospital expenditures is used to correct preventable medical mistakes or infections that
people catch in hospitals. Additionally, medical staff are in short supply.
Affordability and Disparity:
Healthcare can be expensive, and many individuals, particularly those in low- and middle-income countries, struggle to afford basic healthcare services.
Despite advances in medical technology, significant inequalities in health outcomes persist globally, particularly
for marginalized populations.
Scarcity of Health Personnels:
The healthcare sector faces shortages of trained and qualified health workers in many countries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
India has 1 government doctor per 10,189 people (the WHO recommends a ratio of 1:1,000),
indicating a shortage of 6,00,000 doctors.
Non-Communicable Diseases:
Non-communicable diseases, such as
heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes, are becoming increasingly common
and place a significant burden on healthcare systems.
