**********India-US Ties During the Presidency of Joe Biden
Why in News?
On the sidelines of the Quad leaders’ summit, the Indian PM held a meeting with United States President Joe Biden.
As this meeting between the two world leaders may have been the last before Biden leaves the White House in January 2025, i
t is necessary to look into how the Biden presidency has shaped US-Indian relations.
What’s in Today’s Article?
How did Biden Mould US-Indian Relations Prior to Taking Office as US President?
Legacy of Donald Trump’s Presidency for India - US Ties
India - US Ties During the Biden’s Presidency
Technology Cooperation Between India - US
What are the Issues in the India - US Ties?
Before becoming Vice President to President Barack Obama:
In 2006
, Biden stated that by 2020, the United States and India will be the two closest nations in the world.
In 2008
, he (then Senator) worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the
landmark India-US nuclear deal
approved in the US Congress.
As a VP to President Barack Obama:
In 2013
, he visited India and met the then Prime Minister (Manmohan Singh) and Vice President (Hamid Ansari).
In 2020
, as the Democratic Presidential nominee, Biden said that
he would stand with India in confronting various threats along its borders
Legacy of Donald Trump’s Presidency for India - US Ties:
President Biden
inherited a strong India-US relationship
from his predecessor Donald Trump.
Aligning Washington and New Delhi’s positions,
Trump framed China as a strategic rival and adversary to the US
for the first time. Biden carried Trump’s legacy forward in this regard.
Trump revived the Quad grouping
(India, the US, Australia, and Japan) in
2017
In 2021
, Biden elevated the Quad to the leaders’ level - the highest in international diplomacy, and hosted the first Quad leaders’ summit.
India - US Ties During the Biden’s Presidency:
Interaction between top leaders:
Since the first Quad leaders’ summit in 2021, Biden and the Indian PM have met six times at the leaders’ level, including four times in person.
On the bilateral front, the two have interacted at least 10 times, including twice virtually.
Strategic alignment vis-à-vis China:
In the post-pandemic world, both countries wanted to de-risk themselves from future China-related disruptions, and become a part of a resilient global supply chain.
Advantage to India:
Since the end of World War II, no major country has prospered without technological assistance from Washington.
The USA provided considerable assistance in the rise of China as well.
India also wished to be part of the US-led tech ecosystem.
Technology Cooperation Between India - US:
Initiative for Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET):
In 2023, the two National Security Advisers launched the
in Washington to -
Facilitate strategic technology collaborations
in critical and emerging technologies, and
Enable co-development and co-production
in the tech sphere.
It aims to connect the two countries’ respective innovation ecosystems, especially in
AI, quantum, telecom, space, biotech, semiconductors
, and emerging defence technologies.
After multiple NSA-level meetings (the most recent one in June 2024) the outcomes of iCET are now visible.
The outcomes of iCET:
Setting up a semiconductor fabrication plant in India:
The Indian PM’s recent visit saw the signing of an agreement for setting up a
This will be enabled by support from the
India Semiconductor Mission
as well as a strategic technology partnership between Bharat Semi, 3rdiTech, and the US Space Force.
This plant would make chips for use in
national security, next generation telecommunications and green energy applications
Both are working on a broad range of technology partnerships:
From joint research conducted by
NASA and ISRO
on the International Space Station, to a
pact for critical minerals supply
chains and emerging digital technologies in Asia and Africa.
There has also been progress regarding a deal for
31 remotely piloted aircraft
which India would acquire from the US.
Significance of the iCET:
The fab titled Shakti
(or power) would not only be the
first technology partnership
between Indian businesses and the US Space Force, but also a first in the Quad.
This marks a “glass-ceiling broken” in tech diplomacy
, by going into true chip fabrication.
What are the Issues in the India-US Ties?
The alleged assassination plot
against US-based pro-Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun has been a thorny issue. Days before the Indian PM’s visit to the US,
A US court issued summons to NSA Ajit Doval
, after Pannun filed a civil suit seeking damages for the alleged assassination plot.
A group of pro-Khalistan separatists visited the White House
on the eve of the Indian PM’s US visit.
India must resolve this matter
in order to allay Washington's concerns regarding New Delhi's democratic credentials.
However, the two countries’ strategic alignment vis-à-vis China means that such challenges are only minor wrinkles to be ironed out.

**********Bilkis Bano case - Supreme Court dismisses Gujarat review plea
Why in news?
The Supreme Court rejected the Gujarat government's plea to review its January 8 verdict, which had canceled the remission granted to 11 men convicted of raping Bilkis Bano and killing seven of her family members during the 2002 Gujarat riots.
The Gujarat government contested certain "adverse" observations made by the court in the January verdict, arguing that such remarks should not have been made against the state. However, the court found no merit in the review plea and dismissed it.
What’s in today’s article?
Remission
Key highlights of the January 8 judgement by SC
What is Remission?
About
Remission is the complete ending of a sentence at a reduced point.
Remission is distinct from both furlough and parole in that it is a reduction in sentence as opposed to a break from prison life.
Constitutional Provisions
Both the President and the Governor have been vested with sovereign power of pardon by the Constitution.
Under Article 72
, the President
can grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions
of punishment or suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person.
Under Article 161
, a Governor can grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment, or suspend, remit or commute the sentence.
Statutory power of remission
The Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) also provided for remission of prison sentences. This is because
prisons is a State Subject
Under Section 432 of CrPC, the ‘appropriate government’ may suspend or remit a sentence, in whole or in part, with or without conditions.
Under Section 433 of CrPC, any sentence may be commuted to a lesser one by the appropriate government.
This power is available to State governments so that they may order the release of prisoners before they complete their prison terms.
CrPC is now replaced by the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita
CHAPTER XXXIV of the BNSS 2023 deals with the powers of remission or commutation in certain cases under the following sections:
Section 473
- Power to suspend or remit sentences.
The Central Government has the power to do so in cases where the sentence is for an offense against a law that comes under the executive power of the Union.
In other cases, the Government of the State where the offender is sentenced has the power to do so.
Section 474
- Power to commute sentences. The appropriate Government can commute any punishment to any other punishment without the consent of the offender.
Section 475
- Restriction on powers of remission or commutation in certain cases.
Section 477
-  State Government acting after concurrence with the Central Government in certain cases.
Guidelines to be followed while granting Remission
In ‘
Laxman Naskar v. Union of India’ (2000) case
, the Supreme Court laid down five grounds on which remission is considered:
Whether the offence is an individual act of crime that does not affect the society;
Whether there is a chance of the crime being repeated in future;
Whether the convict has lost the potentiality to commit crime;
Whether any purpose is being served in keeping the convict in prison; and
Socio-economic conditions of the convict’s family.
Also, convicts serving life sentences are entitled to seek remission after serving a minimum of 14 years in prison.
What is Bilkis Bano Case?
In the aftermath of the Godhra riots in Gujarat in 2002, Bikinis Bano and her family were attacked by a group of people.
Bilkis was brutally gangraped and seven of her family members were murdered.
Her case was taken up by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Supreme Court, which ordered an investigation by the CBI.
Due to persistent death threats,
the trial was moved out of Gujarat to Mumbai where charges were filed against these people
In January 2008, a special CBI court in Mumbai had sentenced the 11 accused to life imprisonment.
Release of these convicts
In 2022, one of the convicts named Radheshyam Shah, after completing 15 years and four months of his life term, moved to the SC for early release.
In May 2022, the SC passed this case to the Gujarat government.
It asked the Gujarat government to consider Shah’s application for premature release, as per the state’s 1992 remission policy.
On August 15, 2022, the Gujarat government released all 11 convicts in the gangrape case under its remission policy.
However, this decision sparked a major public backlash, and prompted petitions from opposition MPs.
Review petition by Bilkis Bano
Bilkis Bano in 2022 filed an appeal in the Supreme Court to review the decision of the Gujarat government ordering release of the 11 gangrape convicts.
January 8 judgement of Supreme Court
In response to the review petition filed by Bilkis Bano, the apex court, on January 8,
overturned
the Gujarat government's decision to release the 11 convicts.
The Gujarat government was
not the appropriate government to pass the remission order as the trial was held in Maharashtra
The exemption order lacks competence.
Criminals can be released only by the state where they are tried
The bench also held that the SC order of May 13, 2022 was obtained by fraud and suppression of facts.
Gujarat government should have filed a plea seeking review of the 2022 order stating they are not the competent government.
Supreme Court came down heavily against its own judgment in May 2022
In May 2022, the SC ruled that there cannot be a concurrent jurisdiction of two State governments on the issue of remission.
Premature release of a convict has to be considered in terms of the policy applicable in the State
where the crime was committed
Hence, Gujrat government’s remission policy was applied for the release of these convicts.
The rule of law must be preserved unmindful of the ripples of the consequences.
News Summary- Supreme Court dismisses Gujarat review plea
About the news
The Supreme Court dismissed the Gujarat government's review plea challenging its January 8 judgment that canceled the remission granted to 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano case.
The January judgment accused Gujarat of being complicit with one of the convicts, Radheshyam Shah, and held that the May 2022, order granting remission was obtained through fraud and suppression of facts.
The Supreme Court also criticized Gujarat for not filing a review against the 2022 order sooner, which could have avoided further litigation.
Stand of Gujarat govt
In its review plea, Gujarat argued that it was only complying with the 2022 Supreme Court directive to decide the remission application under its 1992 Remission Policy, though it consistently maintained that Maharashtra was the appropriate authority to decide.
The state rejected the court's accusation of "usurpation of power" and emphasized that it had no need to file a review petition as Bilkis Bano herself had done so, but her review was dismissed in December 2022.
The state further contended that it was not complicit in any fraud.

**********Storms brewing in East, South China seas
Why in news?
In recent years, maritime East Asia has become a hotspot for power politics, particularly in the East and South China Seas.
The East China Sea, bordered by China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, has seen repeated tensions over the
Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands
, which are under Japanese control but claimed by China.
Meanwhile, the South China Sea, located between China, Taiwan, and five Southeast Asian nations—Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, and Indonesia—has emerged as a critical flashpoint.
China has aggressively asserted its territorial claims in this region, escalating disputes and heightening geopolitical tensions across the Indo-Pacific.
What’s in today’s article?
Significance of these seas
Posture taken by China in this region
Response from regional countries
Significance of East China Sea (ECS) and South China sea (SCS)
Significance for China
Geopolitical Control
Both seas are crucial for China’s defense and military positioning. Control over these waters allows China to project power in the region and safeguard its national security interests.
The SCS is part of China's "first island chain" defense strategy, forming a buffer against external threats.
Territorial Claims
China views the ECS and SCS as integral parts of its territorial sovereignty, with ongoing disputes over islands like the Diaoyu/Senkaku in the ECS and several islets and reefs in the SCS.
In its 2019 Defence White Paper, China declares that the South China Sea islands and Diaoyu Islands are integral parts of its territory.
Trade Routes
South China Sea is one of the world's busiest maritime trade corridors, with an estimated $3.4 trillion in annual trade passing through it.
Control over this region gives China potential leverage over international shipping routes.
Fisheries and Resources
Both the ECS and SCS are rich in fish stocks, a critical resource for China’s food security and economy.
The seas also provide livelihoods for millions in neighboring countries.
Energy Resources
The South China Sea is believed to hold significant reserves of oil and natural gas.
Securing these resources is vital for China's growing energy demands and for other nations relying on the region's resources.
Significance for other countries
Key maritime route
The key maritime trade routes in East Asia pass through these two seas.
Taiwan Strait is a critical maritime choke point
Vital for digital economy
The region is home to undersea cables that are important for the global digital economy.
Vital for energy security
As per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, 10 billion barrels of petroleum and petroleum products and 6.7 trillion cubic feet of liquefied natural gas passed through the South China Sea.
It is also home to vast reserves of untapped oil and natural gas.
Global Security
The East and South China Seas are flashpoints for potential conflict.
It is drawing global attention from powers like the U.S., which conducts Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) to challenge China’s maritime claims.
These tensions affect global trade, security alliances, and regional stability in the Indo-Pacific.
China aggressively pushing its territorial claims in both seas in two ways
:
by building defence-related infrastructure such as ports, military installations, airstrips, and artificial islands and
by pushing back against the claims of regional countries.
East China Sea Tensions
In the East China Sea, China has aggressively contested Japan's control over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, leading to multiple crises.
Notable incidents include the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain in 2010 and
Japan's nationalization of the islands in 2012
Both countries took maximalist positions, and China responded by banning rare earth mineral exports to Japan.
While tensions have slightly eased in recent years, 2023 witnessed the highest level of Chinese Coast Guard activity near the islands, signaling ongoing disputes.
China's assertive foreign policy has strained its relations with South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan.
South China Sea Power Asymmetry
In the South China Sea, China's growing power has resulted in increased military presence and aggression towards claimant countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei.
With the world's largest navy by numbers, China has conducted "grey zone" operations that involve harassment tactics like ramming vessels, using water cannons, and military-grade lasers, short of initiating full-scale conflict.
Philippines-China Tensions
Tensions between China and the Philippines have intensified since 2022,
especially around Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal
China has repeatedly disrupted the Philippines' resupply missions. China's heavier and larger Coast Guard ships frequently ram smaller Philippine vessels, creating risks of miscalculation.
The growing frequency of these incidents, including clashes in mid-2024, reflects China's determination to assert its dominance.
Strategic Alignment and Legal Rejection
In July 2024, China conducted joint naval exercises with Russia in the South China Sea, showcasing its geopolitical alliances.
Despite a
2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration rejecting China's territorial claims in the South China Sea
, China continues to dismiss the legal decision, maintaining its aggressive posture in the region.
Regional Responses to China's Aggression in the East and South China Seas
Strengthening Defence Capabilities
Countries in the Indo-Pacific have ramped up their military expenditures to counter China’s growing power.
Japan aims to double its defense budget by 2027, and the Philippines has acquired BrahMos anti-ship missiles from India as part of its defense buildup.
Active Responses at Sea
Since 2022, the Philippines has pushed back against China’s activities, publicizing incidents and filming Chinese vessels to shape perceptions.
They have also involved international journalists in documenting Chinese behavior in the West Philippine Sea, turning public diplomacy into a strategic tool.
Narrative Battle
Countries are engaging in a battle of narratives, using public diplomacy and media to highlight China’s aggressive actions and gain international support.
Strengthening Alliances with the U.S.
Allies like the Philippines, Japan, and South Korea have strengthened their defense ties with the U.S.
Cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines in the South China Sea has reached “historic levels,” with increased base access, training, and joint exercises.
A broader multilateral cooperation dubbed the ‘Squad’ involves the U.S., Australia, Japan, and the Philippines.
Trilateral Cooperation
The U.S., Japan, and South Korea have deepened their trilateral defense relationship, with their Defense Ministers meeting for the first time in July 2024.
They oppose any unilateral attempts to alter the status quo in the Indo-Pacific and emphasize adherence to international law, including freedom of navigation.

**********Fortifying the Basic Structure
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Simultaneous elections;
Why in the News?
With the Union Cabinet’s approval of the report by the High-Level Committee recommending simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, the debate over “One Nation, One Election” (ONOE) has once again come to the forefront.
How can Simultaneous Elections enhance governance and stability?
Reduction of Policy Paralysis
: Simultaneous elections prevent the frequent imposition of the
Model Code of Conduct (MCC)
, which temporarily halts new policy initiatives and decision-making. This ensures that
governance continues
uninterrupted.
Efficient Resource Allocation
: Election authorities, security forces, and government resources would be deployed more efficiently since elections are held once in a fixed cycle, allowing for
long-term planning
execution of policies.
Cost-Effective
: Holding simultaneous elections reduces the cost of organizing elections multiple times, allowing the government to
focus funds on development projects
rather than repeated electoral processes.
Political Stability
: It minimizes the risks of
constant political instability
caused by staggered elections, ensuring a stable policy environment for long-term economic and social development.
About the Voter Engagement and Participation:
Voters may be more inclined to participate in elections if they
only need to vote once
to elect both state and national representatives, which can lead to improved engagement and turnout.
Simultaneous elections make the process
more convenient for voters,
as they need to participate only once, avoiding voter fatigue caused by frequent electoral exercises.
Voting for both state and national representatives at the same time can allow voters to make more
informed decisions
by seeing a clearer alignment of their political choices at both levels.
Impact on Political Dynamics:
Level Playing Field
: Simultaneous elections reduce the advantage for
ruling parties
that often leverage state elections for national influence and vice versa.
Opposition parties
will benefit from this, as their campaign resources and strategies can be focused at one time.
Less Populism
: With fixed election dates, political parties may be
less inclined to resort to
short-term populist measures,
allowing for more substantive debates on long-term issues.
Reduced Election Fatigue
: Frequent elections can create voter fatigue and disengagement from political processes. Simultaneous elections reduce this fatigue, which can also lower campaign costs for parties.
Strategic Alliances
: Parties may form more concrete alliances across states and national elections, leading to
more coherent national and state-level strategies
instead of fragmented political campaigning.
Way forward:
Constitutional and Legislative Reforms
: Amendments to the Constitution and electoral laws should be carefully designed to align election cycles of the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, ensuring a smooth transition without undermining democratic processes.
Building Consensus Across Political Spectrum
: A broad political consensus must be achieved through dialogue, involving all stakeholders to address concerns and mitigate opposition, ensuring that simultaneous elections are seen as a step toward democratic efficiency rather than partisanship.
Mains PYQ:
Simultaneous election to the Lok Sabha and the State Assemblies will limit the amount of time and money spent in electioneering but it will reduce the government’s accountability to the people’ Discuss.

Rising sea levels and changing storm patterns threaten coastal communities, military installations, and infrastructure.
Erosion of Islands:
The creation of artificial islands by China is accelerating coastal erosion and destroying coral reefs, which are critical to local marine ecosystems.
What are the implications of military activities by regional powers in the East and South China Seas?
Growing Militarization:
China has rapidly expanded its military presence, including the construction of airstrips, ports, and other defense infrastructure.
maritime militias
have been active in harassing the vessels of other claimant states, particularly in the South China Sea.
Challenge the US Navy:
China’s military activities are seen as part of its broader strategy to challenge U.S. naval supremacy in the Indo-Pacific. This strategy also includes controlling vital sea lanes, undersea cables, and energy reserves.
How are local communities and economies affected?
Economic Disruption:
China’s actions in the South China Sea, particularly around disputed fishing areas, have impacted
local economies dependent on fishing
Maritime Trade:
The region is home to critical sea lanes through which a
significant portion of global trade
, including energy supplies, passes. Any conflict or blockade in these waters would have severe global economic ramifications.
Impact on Tourism:
The increasing militarization and tension also negatively impact tourism in coastal areas.
Way forward:
Strengthening Maritime Partnerships:
India should enhance its strategic maritime partnerships in the Indo-Pacific through forums like the Quad (India, U.S., Japan, and Australia) and ASEAN to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.
Economic and Infrastructure Diplomacy:
India can leverage initiatives like SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and enhance its economic presence by investing in infrastructure, connectivity, and capacity-building projects in Southeast Asian countries.
Mains PYQ:
South China Sea has assumed great geopolitical significance in the present context. Comment.

, and
Esplanade and Kalighat
Significance of Trams

oldest running tram system
, symbolizing the city’s
colonial past and cultural identity

As a
symbol of resilience
, Kolkata’s trams have survived while other cities phased them out.
They also serve as a
unique tourist attraction
