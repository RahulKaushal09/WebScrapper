Brown dwarf
Scientists have puzzled over the object known as Gliese 229B, the first known brown dwarf discovered 30 years ago is actually twins orbiting each other.
About Brown dwarf:
Brown dwarfs are
sometimes called failed
stars because they’re lighter than stars, but heavier than gas giant planets.
Features
These objects have a size between that of a giant planet like Jupiter and that of a small star.
accumulate material
like a star, not like a planet.
They can also
have clouds made
out of precipitates in their atmospheres. However, while we have water clouds on Earth, the clouds on brown dwarfs are much hotter and likely made up of hot silicate particles.
Thus, they hold onto their lighter elements (hydrogen and helium) more effectively than planets and have a relatively low metal content.
do not have enough mass
for
their cores
to burn nuclear fuel and radiate starlight. This is why they are sometimes referred to as “failed stars.”
The difference between brown dwarfs and stars is that, unlike stars, brown
dwarfs do not reach stable luminosities
by thermonuclear fusion of normal hydrogen.
Both stars and brown dwarfs produce energy by fusion of deuterium (a rare isotope of hydrogen) in their first few million years.

**********African Penguin
A new study by an international team of researchers from South Africa and the United Kingdom has found that artificial nests can enhance the breeding success of African penguins.
About African Penguin:
Appearance:
It has a black stripe and a pattern of
unique black spots on its chest
, as well as pink glands above its eyes that become pinker as the penguin gets hotter. Males are larger than females and have larger beaks.
Habitat:
It is usually found within 40 kilometers of the shore, coming onshore to a variety of coastal habitats to breed, molt, and rest.
Distribution:
This penguin breeds on the African mainland from Hollams Bird Island, Namibia to Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa.
The species breeds
naturally in burrows dug into guano
(a natural substance composed of the excrement of birds, bats, and seals), which protects them from the extreme heat of their environment.
This penguin's average lifespan in the
wild is 20 years.
It feeds on pelagic schooling fish, particularly sardine and anchovy.
Conservation status

**********Centre’s direct tax collection performance goes up on all counts
Why in news?
According to data released by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the contribution of direct taxes to total tax revenue climbed to 56.72 per cent in 2023-24, the highest in 14 years.
What’s in today’s article?
Direct tax
Key highlights of the data released by the CBDT
Analysis
About
Direct tax is a tax paid directly by the taxpayer to the government and cannot be shifted.
This is the opposite of indirect tax, which is a tax levied on goods and services and can be passed on to another entity or individual.
The direct rules are framed such that taxes turn out to be a method to redistribute money in the country.
Examples
The more common types of direct tax are: Individual income tax; Corporate income tax; Capital gains tax; Estate tax; Property tax etc.
Record Contribution of Direct Taxes in 2023-24
In FY24, the contribution of direct taxes to total tax revenue reached 56.72%, the highest in 14 years.
This marks an increase from 54.63% in FY23, reducing the share of indirect taxes to 43.28%.
Direct tax-to-GDP ratio
The direct tax-to-GDP ratio also hit a
two-decade high of 6.64%.
A "direct tax-to-GDP ratio" is an economic indicator that measures the proportion of a country's total direct tax revenue relative to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It essentially shows how much direct tax is collected compared to the overall size of the economy.
A higher ratio indicates the government is effectively collecting more direct taxes from its citizens, allowing for greater funding of public services and investments.
It signifies a potentially stronger tax administration and better compliance within the economy.
Surge in Personal Income Tax Collections
For the second consecutive year,
personal income tax collections exceeded corporate tax collections.
Corporate tax is a direct tax imposed by the government on the income or profits earned by a corporation.
Unlike individual income tax, which is levied on personal earnings, corporate tax is specifically targeted at business entities, including both domestic and multinational companies.
In FY24, personal income tax collections stood at ₹10.45 lakh crore, surpassing corporate tax collections of ₹9.11 lakh crore.
This shift began after the corporate tax rate cut in September 2019.
Tax rates for corporates were cut in September 2019 in India, with the rate for existing companies reducing from 30 to 22%, and that of new companies from 25 to 15%.
Tax Buoyancy Growth
Tax buoyancy, indicating the growth rate of taxes relative to the nominal economic growth, increased to 2.12 in FY24, compared to 1.18 in FY23.
Tax buoyancy is a ratio of change in tax revenue in relation to change in gross domestic product or GDP of an economy.
It measures how responsive a taxation policy is to growth in economic activities.
This marked the highest level since FY22 (2.52).
Cost of Tax Collection at a Record Low
The cost of tax collection dropped to 0.44% of total tax collections, the lowest since 2000-01.
However, in absolute terms, the cost increased to ₹8,634 crore.
Increase in Tax Filers and Taxpayers
Income tax return filers grew from 7.4 crore in FY23 to 8.09 crore in FY24.
Taxpayers, defined as those filing returns or having tax deducted at source, increased from 9.37 crore to 10.41 crore.
State-Wise Direct Tax Contributions
Maharashtra contributed 39% of the total direct tax revenue (₹7.6 lakh crore), followed by Karnataka (12% or ₹2.34 lakh crore) and Delhi (10.4% or ₹2.03 lakh crore).
Sign of Progressive Taxation and Equity
A higher share of direct taxes, linked to income levels, is considered progressive as it reduces the burden on the poor compared to indirect taxes.
The last time the share of direct taxes exceeded FY24 levels was in FY10, at 60.78%.
Signals a growth phase of the Indian economy
As per the experts, the increasing share of direct tax collections and significant jump in direct tax-to-GDP ratio signal a growth phase of the Indian economy.
Increased formalization of the economy
The government has steadily increased its data collection as well as its IT prowess, in addition to expanding the scope of taxes collected or deducted at source.
The increased formalization of the economy too has helped.
Credit to the government’s efforts
A fair share of credit can be given to the government’s efforts in rationalizing direct tax provisions and in bringing tax certainty among the investor community.
Key steps such as dispute resolution schemes and digitization of tax compliance procedures have played a key role in boosting direct tax collections.
The cost of collection has also gone down which is likely the result of use of technology and artificial intelligence tools by tax department in its operations

**********SC Upholds Section 6A of Citizenship Act
Why in News?
In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court of India upheld the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955.
This section grants citizenship to certain immigrants who entered Assam between January 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Section 6A of the Citizenship Act 1955
Why was Section 6A of the Citizenship Act Challenged?
SC's Ruling Regarding Section 6A of the Citizenship Act
Key Takeaways from the SC's Ruling on Section 6A of the Citizenship Act
Section 6A of the Citizenship Act 1955:
Background:
Section 6A was introduced following the
Assam Accord of 1985
, which aimed to address concerns regarding migrants from Bangladesh.
The accord
established that January 1, 1966, would be the base cut-off date for identifying foreigners in Assam, with provisions for regularising those who entered between this date and March 24, 1971.
This was meant to mitigate the socio-political tensions arising from immigration in the state.
Provisions of Section 6A:
Under this section, individuals of Indian origin who entered Assam
before January 1, 1966
, are deemed citizens.
Those who entered after this date but
before March 24, 1971
, can register as citizens, though they are excluded from electoral rolls for ten years.
Anyone entering
after March 24, 1971
, is classified as an illegal immigrant.
Grounds for challenge:
Petitioners, including NGOs like Assam Public Works and Assam Sanmilita Mahasangha, argued that Section 6A is
discriminatory and violates the equality clause of the Constitution
They contended that it
sets a different standard for citizenship in Assam
compared to the rest of India, which is July 1948.
Concerns were raised that granting citizenship to migrants would infringe upon the cultural rights of indigenous Assamese people under
Article 29(1) of the Constitution
Defence of Section 6A:
The government defended Section 6A by citing
Article 11 of the Constitution
, which empowers Parliament to regulate citizenship matters.
The Centre argued that if Section 6A were to be struck down,
a vast number of residents would risk being rendered stateless
after enjoying citizenship for over five decades.
The Centre highlighted that Assam has historically been a
diverse state
, with demographic changes influenced by various
geopolitical factors
SC's Ruling Regarding Section 6A of the Citizenship Act:
The SC's decision followed a 2014 referral to a Constitution Bench to address pivotal legal questions surrounding this section.
Bench:
The ruling was delivered by a
five-judge bench
led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud,
with a 4:1 majority.
Majority opinion:
Parliamentary authority:
CJI stated that Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution pertain solely to the citizenship rights at the time of the Constitution's inception.
In contrast, Section 6A addresses individuals not covered by these articles.
The Parliament has the authority to define citizenship criteria based on unique circumstances.
Unique circumstances justified the differentiation:
The situation in Assam (particularly the demographic impacts of migration) warranted a specific legal framework, which did not violate the right to equality under
Article 14
of the Constitution.
Cultural rights:
The mere presence of diverse ethnic groups does not undermine cultural rights and Section 6A embodies the “
spirit of fraternity
”.
Dissenting opinion:
Temporal unreasonableness:
The statutory provision (Section 6A) may have been constitutionally valid at the time of its enactment, it has become “unconstitutional” with the efflux of time.
Absence of a clear timeline for identifying foreigners:
This undermines the rights of Assam's indigenous people and complicates the citizenship verification process.
Key Takeaways from the SC's Ruling on Section 6A of the Citizenship Act:
The SC’s ruling on Section 6A
reaffirms the complexities surrounding immigration and citizenship in India
, particularly in Assam.
While the majority opinion legitimises the law based on the unique context of the state, the dissent raises critical questions about the rights of indigenous populations and the practical implications of citizenship verification processes.
This verdict will likely influence ongoing discussions regarding the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam and the broader narrative of immigration in India.

**********On the Exception to Marital Rape
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background
About Marital Rape Exception (History, Legal Framework, Arguments Against MRE, Judicial Precedents, Govt’s Stand)
Conclusion
Background:
The issue of
marital rape
in India has become a significant topic of legal and social debate.
The Indian Penal Code (IPC), specifically
Exception 2 of Section 375
, exempts husbands from being prosecuted for
non-consensual sexual acts
with their wives, provided the wife is not under 18 years of age.
This exception is now being challenged in court as a violation of women’s
fundamental rights
History & Genesis of Marital Rape Exception:
has its roots in
English common law
, particularly in the
doctrine of coverture
, which regarded a married couple as a single legal entity.
This effectively meant that a wife did not have the legal right to refuse her husband’s sexual advances.
The British jurist
Matthew Hale
argued in the 1700s that a husband could not be guilty of raping his wife, reasoning that by marriage, a woman gave irrevocable consent to sex.
Though England abolished this exception in 1991, India continues to uphold this provision.
In 2017, India raised the age of consent for marital intercourse from 15 to 18 years following the Supreme Court’s ruling in
Independent Thought vs. Union of India
However, the overall exception still persists in Indian law.
Current Legal Framework:
of the IPC defines rape and includes provisions for when sexual intercourse qualifies as non-consensual.
However, Exception 2 of this section provides immunity to husbands for non-consensual acts with their wives, provided they are over 18 years of age.
Other legal provisions such as
Section 85 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)
and the
Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (2005)
offer some protection for married women but are limited in scope and primarily address cruelty, not sexual violence.
Arguments Against the Marital Rape Exception:
Violation of Fundamental Rights
Article 14
: The MRE creates two classes of victims—married and unmarried women.
Unmarried women receive full legal protection against sexual assault, while married women do not, violating the principle of equality before the law.
Article 21
: The MRE infringes on a woman’s right to bodily autonomy and decisional privacy.
The Supreme Court’s rulings in
Puttaswamy vs. Union of India
Joseph Shine vs. Union of India
emphasized that privacy includes the right to control one’s body, irrespective of marital status.
Gender Equality
Critics argue that the MRE reflects
patriarchal values
and reinforces the idea that marriage gives husbands
unconditional sexual access
to their wives, which undermines women’s rights.
International Perspective
Several countries, including the UK, USA, and Australia, have abolished the marital rape exception.
Retaining it in India places the country out of step with modern legal standards concerning women’s rights and sexual autonomy.
Judicial Precedents:
Karnataka High Court (2022)
Hrishikesh Sahoo vs. State of Karnataka
, the court ruled that a husband could be prosecuted for raping his wife, marking a significant shift in addressing sexual violence within marriage.
Delhi High Court Split Verdict (2022)
Justice Rajiv Shakdher
declared the MRE unconstitutional, arguing it violates women’s rights to bodily autonomy.
Justice C. Hari Shankar
, however, upheld the MRE, stating that within marriage, sexual relations constitute a “legitimate expectation.”
This split decision prompted the petitioners to take the case to the Supreme Court.
Government’s Stand:
In a recent affidavit, the
Union Government
opposed striking down the MRE, arguing that
marriage creates a “continuing expectation of reasonable sexual access”
The government has expressed concerns that criminalizing marital rape could disrupt the
sanctity of marriage
and lead to
false accusations
Conclusion:
The debate over the
raises critical questions about
gender equality
, and the evolving role of marriage in Indian society.
As the Supreme Court deliberates, the outcome will not only affect the legal status of marital rape in India but also set a significant precedent for
gender justice
in the country.

**********Centre claims fortified rice is safe for consumption for everyone
Why in news?
The Centre defended its initiative to supply fortified rice, aimed at combating micronutrient deficiencies, amid safety concerns and claims that it benefits multinational companies.
The Union Food Ministry emphasized that iron-fortified rice is safe, following World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, and is globally recognized.
What’s in today’s article?
Rice fortification
Fortified rice is safe for consumption for everyone
About/definition
The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) defines fortification as the deliberate addition of essential micronutrients to food to improve nutritional quality and provide public health benefits, with minimal health risks.
Need for fortification of rice
Malnutrition in India, especially among women and children
According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), anaemia affects a significant portion of the population,
with every second woman being anaemic and every third child stunted
Deficiencies in iron, Vitamin B12, and folic acid are widespread, affecting health and productivity.
Fortification of Rice as a Solution
Rice, a staple food for two-thirds of India’s population
, is considered an ideal candidate for fortification to address malnutrition.
Per capita rice consumption in India is 6.8 kg per month, and fortifying it with micronutrients can help supplement the diet of the poor.
Fortification Process
Fortification technologies include coating, dusting, and extrusion, with extrusion being the most suitable for India.
In extrusion, dry rice flour is mixed with micronutrients and water, then passed through an extruder to create fortified rice kernels (FRKs), which resemble regular rice.
These kernels are blended with regular rice in a 10g FRK to 1 kg rice ratio to produce fortified rice.
Nutrient Content in Fortified Rice
According to FSSAI standards, 1 kg of fortified rice contains:
Iron: 28 mg-42.5 mg
Folic acid: 75-125 micrograms
Vitamin B12: 0.75-1.25 micrograms
It may also be fortified with other micronutrients like zinc, vitamin A, and various B vitamins.
Cooking and Consumption of Fortified Rice
Fortified rice is cooked and eaten just like regular rice, and it retains its micronutrient levels after cooking.
Packaging is marked with a logo (‘+F’) and labeled as “Fortified with Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12.”
Progress of the Rice Fortification Initiative
In 2015, PM Modi announced that rice distributed under government schemes, such as the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Mid-Day Meal Scheme, would be fortified by 2024.
The Centre implemented the initiative in phases:
Phase 1
: Integrated Child Development Services and PM POSHAN by March 2022.
Phase 2
: PDS and welfare schemes in 112 Aspirational Districts by March 2023.
Phase 3:
Full nationwide coverage by March 2024.
Rice fortification ecosystem in India
Manufacturers and Premix Suppliers
India has 1,023 rice kernel manufacturers producing 111 LMT of fortified rice annually, well beyond the 5.20 LMT required for the programme.
Additionally, 232 premix suppliers produce 75 LMT annually, far exceeding the 0.104 LMT needed.
Expansion of Fortification Infrastructure
The rice fortification ecosystem has expanded significantly, with over 21,000 out of 30,000 operational rice mills equipped with blending equipment.
This allows a monthly production capacity of 223 LMT of fortified rice.
Distribution of fortified rice
The distribution is taking place under schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), Integrated Child Development Service (ICDS), and PM POSHAN (erstwhile MDM).
Recently, in October 2024, the govt approved the continuation of the universal supply of fortified rice under all Union government schemes, including the PMGKAY, from July 2024 until December 2028.
About the news:
In a statement, the Union Food Ministry said scientific evidence suggested that iron-fortified rice was safe for consumption for everyone.
It said that said India was following WHO guidelines and fortification was a globally recognised practice.
Health Advisory for Fortified Rice Packaging
The Food Ministry stated that, under the
Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulations, 2018
, fortified rice packaging was initially required to include a health advisory for individuals with Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Anaemia.
However,
a scientific committee questioned the necessity of this advisory, noting that no other country mandates such labeling
Safety Assessment for Individuals with Hemoglobinopathies
A working group of the Ministry evaluated the safety of iron-fortified rice for people with hemoglobinopathies.
Hemoglobinopathies are inherited disorders affecting the structure or production of hemoglobin in red blood cells.
These lead to conditions like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, causing abnormal oxygen transport and various health complications.
They concluded that
current scientific evidence does not indicate any safety concerns for such individuals consuming fortified rice
Iron Intake in Thalassemia Patients
The Ministry clarified that the iron intake from fortified rice is minimal compared to the iron absorbed through blood transfusions in Thalassemia patients.
Additionally, fortified rice undergoes chelation to manage any potential iron overload.
Iron Absorption in Sickle Cell Anaemia Patients
Individuals with Sickle Cell Anaemia are unlikely to absorb excess iron from fortified rice due to naturally higher levels of hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron absorption, reducing the risk of iron overload in these patients.

**********SC upholds Section 6A of Citizenship Act as valid
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Citizenship of India;
Why in the News?
On October 17, 2024, political parties widely welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision upholding Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, addressing citizenship under the Assam Accord.
What is Section 6A?
Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, added in 1985, grants citizenship to immigrants in Assam who entered between January 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971, under the Assam Accord provisions.
What are the implications of upholding Section 6A for citizenship in Assam?
Legal Recognition of the Assam Accord:
The verdict reinforces the
Assam Accord’s legal status,
acknowledging the cut-off date of
for granting citizenship to immigrants. This solidifies the Accord’s role as a foundational legal document addressing the state’s citizenship issues.
Clarifying Citizenship Status:
The ruling provides legal clarity on the
citizenship status of individuals
who entered Assam between January 1, 1966, and March 25, 1971. They are granted citizenship if they comply with specific conditions, while those arriving post-1971 are deemed illegal immigrants.
Impact on the NRC Process:
The decision may influence the
National Register of Citizens (NRC)
process in Assam by determining who is eligible for inclusion. The cut-off date could guide the verification of citizenship claims, potentially affecting those at risk of being declared stateless.
How does this ruling interact with existing immigration laws and policies?
Consistency with the Foreigners Act:
The ruling aligns with existing immigration policies under the Foreigners Act, where illegal immigrants are identified and potentially deported.
Implications for Deportation and Detection:
The verdict mandates continued efforts to detect and deport illegal immigrants who arrived post-March 25, 1971.
This may intensify identification and deportation processes, requiring robust legal and administrative mechanisms.
Role in NRC and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) Debate:
The ruling interacts with ongoing discussions about the CAA, which grants
citizenship to non-Muslim migrants
from neighboring countries who entered before December 31, 2014.
What are the broader constitutional implications of this decision?
Federalism and Regional Autonomy:
The judgment upholds Assam’s unique historical and cultural context, recognizing the state’s special legal provisions under the Assam Accord.
Right to Equality and Non-discrimination:
By validating different cut-off dates for citizenship determination in Assam compared to the rest of India, the ruling raises questions about equal treatment and the uniformity of laws across the country.
Judicial Endorsement of Accord-based Legislation:
The ruling sets a precedent for upholding legislation based on historical accords or regional agreements.
Way forward:
Full Implementation of the Assam Accord:
Ensure the complete execution of all clauses of the Accord, including detecting, deleting, and deporting illegal immigrants, while providing support to those recognized as citizens to integrate smoothly into society.
Strengthen Legal and Administrative Frameworks:
Enhance the infrastructure for the NRC process, deportation mechanisms, and border management to maintain consistency in immigration policies, while addressing humanitarian concerns for affected individuals.

Mains level:
Key initiatives to achieve SDG;
Why in the News?
On September 9-10, 2023, New Delhi hosted the G-20 Summit, where participants committed to enhancing the implementation of the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development.
How effectively is India progressing towards achieving the SDGs by 2030?
Current Status
: India is classified in the
“medium human development”
category, with an HDI value of 0.644 and a
rank of 134 out of 193 countries
Improvement Over Time
: India saw an increase of 48.4% in HDI value from
1990 (0.434) to 2022 (0.644)
, indicating positive long-term trends despite recent stagnation and slight declines due to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
SDG Interconnections
: India’s HDI dimensions directly align with several SDGs, including
SDG-3 (good health), SDG-4 (quality education),
SDG-5 (gender equality)
. Progress in these areas is critical for achieving broader SDG targets.
Rank Improvements
: From 2015 to 2022, India improved its HDI ranking by
four places
, while neighboring countries such as
Bangladesh and Bhutan
improved their rankings by
12 and 10 places,
respectively, highlighting the need for India to enhance its efforts.
What are the key human development challenges that India faces?
Gender Inequality
: India has one of the largest gender gaps in the
Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR)

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
The
Marital Rape Exception (MRE)
, rooted in the
doctrine of coverture
from English common law, has long sparked debates about the legal autonomy of women within marriage.
Marital Rape Exception (MRE): What is it?
is found in
Exception 2 to Section 375
of the
Indian Penal Code (IPC)
, 1860, and its equivalent,
Section 63 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023
According to these provisions,
sexual intercourse
or sexual acts by a man with his wife do
not constitute rape
if the wife is
above 18 years of age
Why discuss this?
This legal immunity for husbands has been challenged for violating fundamental rights, and now, a
three-judge Bench led by CJI D.Y. Chandrachud
is set to examine the
constitutional validity
of this exception.
The outcome of this case could redefine the boundaries of consent and bodily autonomy within the institution of marriage in India.
Split Verdict by the Delhi High Court in 2022:
1. Justice Rajiv Shakdher’s Opinion:
Declared the
unconstitutional.
Argued that the MRE violates a woman’s
expression
Criticized the exception as being rooted in
patriarchy and misogyny
Held that the classification of marital rape as different from rape outside marriage is
unreasonable and arbitrary
Emphasized that
forced sex outside marriage
is treated as “real rape,” while the same act within marriage is not.
2. Justice C. Hari Shankar’s Opinion:
Upheld the
, considering it legal within the framework of marriage.
sexual relations
within marriage are a
legitimate expectation
Expressed concerns that allowing prosecution of husbands for non-consensual sex would be
antithetical to the institution of marriage
as understood in Indian society.
Believed that introducing the possibility of husbands being seen as
rapists
within marriage would undermine the
Doctrine of Coverture from English Common Law:
states that upon marriage, a
legal existence
was essentially
merged with that of her husband
The married woman was legally
dependent on her husband
, losing autonomy over her legal rights and property.
Impact on Women’s Rights:
Under this doctrine, a wife had
no independent legal identity
during marriage.
Women could not
own property
enter contracts
, or
bring legal claims
without their husband’s approval.
The husband had control over the wife’s body and actions, including
Influence on Marital Rape Exception:
The doctrine formed the basis for the original
in British common law.
It implied that a wife
gave permanent consent
to sexual relations upon marriage, which could not be withdrawn.
This legal reasoning was adopted in many British colonies, including
, and continues to influence Indian law today.
Modern Rejection:
England
abolished the Marital Rape Exception
1991
in the case of
R v. R
, recognizing that the doctrine of coverture no longer reflected the status of women in modern society.
Despite this, the doctrine’s influence persists in India’s legal system, particularly through the
