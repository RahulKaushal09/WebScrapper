**********Flue Gas Desulphurisation
Union Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy (NRE) recently presided over a meeting to review the results of a study conducted by IIT-Delhi on the effect of installing flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) technology on SO2 emissions in various categories of cities.
About Flue Gas Desulphurisation:
It is a technology to eliminate sulphur compounds from exhaust emissions.
Flue gas is the emitted material produced when fossil fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, or wood are burned for heat or power.
FGD Process:
FGD is done through the addition of absorbents, which can remove up to 95% of the sulphur dioxide from the flue gas.
Substances such as ammonia or sodium sulphite are used as absorbents; however, the use of lime or limestone slurry (wet limestone scrubbing) is also widespread.
The uncleaned flue gas is sprayed in a scrubber tower (absorber tower) with a mixture of water and limestone (scrubbing slurry), whereby most of the sulphur dioxide is bonded by chemical reaction.
How Sulfur dioxide impacts life?
Sulfur dioxide is a major air pollutant which impacts all life.
It is also a precursor of acid rain, which has significant adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters, and soils, in turn killing insect and aquatic life forms, causing paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and weathering of stone buildings and statues.

**********What is Cybersquatting?
Recently, a Delhi based developer registered the domain, 'JioHotstar,' which ignited a debate on cybersquatting.
About Cybersquatting:
It is an act of registering or using a domain name to profit from a trademark, corporate or personal name of an individual.
Usually, cybersquatting is seen as a form of extortion or even as an attempt to take over business from its rival.
Types of Cybersquatting
Typo squatting: These domains are bought with typological errors in the names of well-known brands. Examples of such misspelled domains are
yajoo.com
facebok.com
etc. The intention behind this act is to divert the target audience whenever they misspell a domain name.
Identity theft: In cases pertaining to identity theft, the website of an already existing brand is copied with the intention of confusing the target consumer.
Name jacking: It involves impersonating a well-known name/ celebrity in cyberspace. Instances of name jacking would include creating fake websites/ social media accounts with a celebrity’s name.
Reverse cybersquatting: It means an event whereby a person/s falsely claims a trademark as their own and falsely accuses the domain owner of cybersquatting. In essence, this act is the opposite of cybersquatting.
In India, there are no specific laws that condemn, prohibit or penalize the act of cybersquatting.
However, domain names are considered as trademarks under the Trademark Act, 1999. Hence, any person who starts using an identical/similar domain name will be held liable for trademark infringement as described under Section 29 of the Trademark Act, 1999.

**********What is Coking Coal?
India’s coking coal imports for the first six months of the current fiscal (April – September) were at a six-year-high at 29.6 million tonnes (mt) with shipments from Russia witnessing a substantial rise of over 200 per cent during this period.
About Coking Coal:
Metallurgical coal, also known as met and coking coal, is a naturally occurring sedimentary rock found within the earth’s crust.
It typically contains more carbon, less ash, and less moisture than thermal coal, which is used for electricity generation.
It is an essential ingredient in the production of steel, making it one of the most widely used building materials on earth.
It is a bituminous coal with a suitable quality that allows the production of metallurgical coke, or simply named coke.
Coke is the main product of the high-temperature carbonisation of coking coal.
It is an essential input material in steelmaking as it is used to produce pig iron in blast furnaces, acting as the reducing agent of iron ore and as the support of the furnace charge.
It takes around 770 kilograms of coal to make one ton of steel, with approximately 70 percent of global steel produced in basic oxygen blast furnaces.
The largest producers of coking coal were China (676 million tons in 2022-62%), Australia (169 million tons in 2022-15%), Russia (96 million tons in 2022-9%), USA (55 million tons-5%), and Canada (34 million tons-3%).

**********Israel launches retaliatory strikes on military targets in Iran
Why in news?
Israel launched what it described as precise and targeted airstrikes on Iran early on October 26 in retaliation to an Iranian attack on Israel earlier this month. This appears to be a major escalation between the two enemy countries.
What’s in today’s article?
Why did Israel attack Iran?
Why are Israel and Iran enemies?
Israel – Iran conflict and Impact on India
October 7 Hamas attack
Iran and Israel, with a long-standing hostile relationship, saw tensions worsen after the October 7 Hamas attacks.
Iran, which does not recognize Israel's right to exist, backs groups like Hamas and Hezbollah in their fight against Israel.
Killing of commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and response of Iran
On April 1, Israel struck the Iranian consulate in Syria, killing 16 people, including commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
Iran responded on April 13 by launching a direct missile and drone attack on Israeli soil. Israel then targeted an Iranian missile defense system in Isfahan.
Death of Hamas leader in Iran
The situation intensified on July 31 with the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, likely by Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
On September 27, Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, also killing Iranian Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan.
On October 1, Iran responded with 200 ballistic missiles attack on Israel, causing minimal damage.
Israel attacks Iran
Israel had vowed to hit back after Iran carried out a ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October.
The recent attack by Israel comes against this backdrop.
Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and its opposition to Israel
Iran and Israel, once allies, became adversaries following Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, which established a regime ideologically opposed to Israel.
Since then, Iran has refused to recognize Israel's right to exist, with its leaders calling for Israel’s destruction.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has referred to Israel as a "cancerous tumor" that will be "uprooted and destroyed."
Shadow war between these two countries
The two countries have engaged in a "shadow war," targeting each other's assets without claiming responsibility.
Tensions have escalated since the October attacks on Israeli communities by Hamas, a Palestinian group supported by Iran.
Israel views Iran as an existential threat due to its rhetoric, support of proxy forces like Hezbollah and Hamas, and its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons, which Iran denies.
Fears of Protracted Red Sea Disruption
A direct conflict between Israel and Iran would cause a prolonged disruption of the Red Sea shipping route.
India is especially vulnerable to these disruptions,
as its trade with Europe, the US, Africa, and West Asia—valued at over $400 billion in FY23—relies heavily on the Suez Canal and Red Sea routes
The involvement of Hezbollah's allies, such as the Houthi rebels in Yemen, heightens the risk of attacks on ships using this critical trade passage.
Impact on Indian Petroleum Exports
In August 2024, India's exports fell by 9%, primarily due to a sharp 38% drop in petroleum product exports, which fell to $5.95 billion from $9.54 billion in August 2023.
Rising shipping costs and the crisis in the Red Sea have led importers to seek alternative sources, impacting Indian exporters' profitability, particularly standalone refiners.
European Market Challenges
Europe, which accounts for 21% of India’s petroleum exports, has been affected by rising shipping costs.
A Crisil report from February 2024 warned that these additional costs would reduce profit margins for petroleum exports, compounding the challenges faced by Indian exporters.
India’s overall exports to the European Union increased by 6.8% this year
, but sectors like machinery, steel, gems, jewellery, and footwear have faced declines.
The rising freight costs are expected to further strain Indian industries reliant on high-volume, low-value exports, making it difficult for them to stay competitive.
Silver lining - Trade Opportunities in West Asia
Despite the conflict, India's trade with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries has grown by 17.8% between January and July 2024, according to a Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) report.
India’s exports to Iran also increased by 15.2% during this period, benefiting from the neutrality of regional players such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar, who have stayed out of the conflict
Risk to India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)
The ongoing conflict in West Asia could hinder the development of the IMEC, a strategic project announced during the G20 in 2023.
The IMEC plan comprises an Eastern Corridor connecting India to the Gulf region and a Northern Corridor connecting the Gulf region to Europe.
It will include a railway and ship-rail transit network, as well as road transport routes.
The IMEC aims to reduce reliance on the Suez Canal by creating faster trade routes through a rail and ship network connecting India to the Gulf and Europe.
However, the widening conflict in the region threatens to delay or complicate the corridor’s progress, casting uncertainty over its future.

Handling security threats - Challenges and way forward
Advisory to curb hoax bomb threats on social media
Widespread threats disrupted Airlines
Over the past two weeks, Indian carriers, including Tata group airlines (Air India, Vistara, and Air India Express), Indigo, Alliance Air, and Star Air, have faced a series of hoax threats.
These incidents have led to emergency measures, flight rerouting, and military fighter jet intercepts, particularly in international airspace when emergency transponder codes were activated.
Although the threats were hoaxes, they resulted in significant delays and financial losses estimated at ₹13-₹17 lakh per hour for airlines.
Nature and Source of Threats
According to the govt, most threats originated on social media. Intelligence agencies are investigating and focusing on tracking IP addresses and VPN usage.
Despite initial suspicions of hoaxes, no potential threat has been overlooked given the scale of India’s daily 4,000 flight operations.
Since the start of these incidents, approximately 275 threats have affected around 48,000 flights.
ICAO’s Aviation Security Guidelines and Directives
Most aviation security guidelines are derived from the
International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Annex 17
on Aviation Security.
These guidelines and
Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs)
are part of the
Chicago Convention
These guidelines mandate global measures against unlawful interference in civil aviation.
ICAO Aviation Security Manual (Doc 8973)
provides member states with detailed security procedures.
Annex 17 and Doc 8973 are continually updated to address new threats and advancements in technology, though detailed discussions and specific guidance are restricted.
Security Agencies and Measures in India
In India, the
Bureau of Civil Aviation Security
responsible for establishing security standards for civilian flights
, while the
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)
oversees flight safety
Other involved agencies include the Airports Authority of India, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), National Security Guard (NSG), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Ministry of Home Affairs, and the judiciary.
Proposed Amendments to Strengthen Aviation Security Laws
In response to recent security threats, amendments are being considered for the
Aircraft Act 1934, Aircraft Rules 1937
, and other relevant laws.
Planned updates include stricter penalties, no-fly list provisions, and expanding legal recourse to address security violations even on the ground.
Updates to the
Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Civil Aviation Act
1982
would further empower authorities to handle in-flight and on-ground security threats.
Systemic Issues
Although details about recent Indian cases aren’t fully disclosed, these incidents have revealed systemic issues, including gaps in
standardized procedures, guidelines, training, technology limitations, communication,
regulatory enforcement
within the aviation security system.
Recommended Technological Investments and Innovations
Addressing hoax calls effectively, according to the expert, requires investment in
advanced call tracking, AI-powered call analysis, voice stress analysis,
comprehensive threat assessment systems
Emerging technologies, such as
quantum computing
aviation cybersecurity frameworks
, could enhance security further.
The expert also recommended implementing
AI-powered chatbots
for preliminary threat assessments and
psychological profiling
of callers to better understand motivations and threat levels.
Proposed Strategies for Deterrence and Awareness
To deter offenders, experts suggested publicly sharing
photos of offenders
on social media and displaying them at airports as a warning.
Additionally, the expert recommended establishing a
global hoax call database
and providing
rewards for informers
to encourage reporting of hoax threats.
About the news
MeitY has advised all social media platforms to follow the rules under the Information Technology (IT) Rules and Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS).
They are asked to make a serious effort to quickly remove any bomb threat posts. If they don’t comply, they could be held legally responsible.
Legal Framework Under IT Act, 2000 and IT Rules, 2021
The advisory underscores the Ministry’s reliance on existing legal provisions to compel platforms to act against misinformation that threatens public order.
Information Technology Act, 2000
, along with the
IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021
, require intermediaries to promptly remove harmful misinformation.
Previously, the Ministry applied similar provisions to tackle the spread of deepfake videos, citing Rule 3(1)(b) of the IT Rules.
Rule 3(1)(b)(v) prohibits misinformation and patently false information.
Potential Consequences for Non-Compliance
The advisory warned that non-compliant platforms risk losing intermediary liability protections, exposing them to potential legal action as publishers of harmful posts.
The Ministry noted that legal actions could be pursued under both the IT Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, if platforms fail to exercise due diligence.

**********Indian Stock Market Slide
Why in News?
The Indian stock market has seen a consistent decline over the past month, with key indices like the Sensex and Nifty falling nearly 1% on October 25, marking the fifth consecutive day of losses.
This drop represents a 7.5% decline for the Sensex in the last month - the largest among global markets during this period.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction to the Indian Stock Market
Market Overview
Reasons Behind the Decline
Global Comparison
Sectoral Impact on Small and Mid-Cap Stocks
Outlook and Future Expectations
Introduction to the Indian Stock Market:
Understanding shares:
Shares represent a unit of ownership in a company, not a physical asset.
Companies issue shares to raise funds for various needs.
Buying or selling shares requires going through a broker or stock exchange, and share prices fluctuate based on demand and supply dynamics.
Types of investments:
Investors in the stock market can choose between:
Long-term (Equity investments):
Designed for extended growth, these are popular for their potential to yield high returns over time.
Short-term (Debt investments):
Typically, lower-risk, these are intended for quicker returns.
How does the share market work in India?
The Indian market is divided into two primary stock exchanges:
National Stock Exchange (NSE): A leading stock exchange in India.
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE): One of the oldest and most established exchanges in India.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
regulates these exchanges to ensure fair practices and investor protection.
Here, securities like equities, bonds, ETFs, and derivatives trade at prices driven by demand and supply.
Purpose of the stock market:
The stock market serves as a regulated, centralised platform where companies and investors meet.
Its primary goal is to facilitate business expansion by allowing companies to raise capital through the sale of shares, providing investors opportunities for profit and growth.
Market Overview:
Sensex performance:
The BSE’s 30-share Sensex dropped by 662.87 points (0.83%) on Friday to close at 79,402.29.
Nifty performance:
The Nifty 50 declined by 218.6 points (0.9%), ending at 24,180.8.
One-month trend:
From September 26 to October 25, Sensex fell by 7.5%, while other global indices experienced smaller declines or even gains.
Reasons Behind the Decline:
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sell-off:
FPIs have withdrawn record funds totalling Rs 85,790 crore in October.
Geopolitical tensions in West Asia:
Uncertainties due to the West Asian conflict have weakened investor sentiment.
Corporate Q2 results:
Lower-than-expected corporate earnings have impacted confidence. Net profit growth of 502 companies slowed to 4.1% in Q2.
Shift to primary markets:
Money has flowed from the secondary market to initial public offerings (IPOs), creating a liquidity shortage.
Global Comparison:
India has been the hardest hit among major indices, experiencing a 7.5% fall.
Meanwhile, other indices like Shanghai (9.99%) and Hang Seng (3.85%) have surged.
Sectoral Impact on Small and Mid-Cap Stocks:
High valuations and liquidity shortage:
Small- and mid-cap stocks have dropped over 8% due to high valuations and limited liquidity, as retail investors divert funds to IPOs.
Individual stock performance:
Many small-cap stocks have fallen 20-30%, primarily due to valuation concerns.
Outlook and Future Expectations:
Market analysts are cautiously optimistic about a recovery within the next two months.
Despite the short-term pressures,
the medium to long-term growth prospects of the Indian economy remains strong.
Valuations suggest a moderate overvaluation but not at a level that would significantly deter long-term investment.
