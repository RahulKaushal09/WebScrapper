India as the World Largest Plastic Polluter
Source: IE
Why in News?
A recent study published in the journal
Nature
has revealed that India is the
highest contributor to global plastic pollution
.
India accounts for approximately
one-fifth
of the total plastic waste generated worldwide.
What are the Key Findings of the Study?
Plastic Waste Generation:
India generates approximately
9.3 million tonnes of plastic pollution
annually. Out of this, 5.8 million tonnes (mt) are incinerated, while 3.5 million tonnes are released into the environment as debris.
This figure is significantly
higher than Nigeria (3.5 mt), Indonesia (3.4 mt), and China (2.8 mt).
India’s waste generation rate is approximately
0.12 kilograms per capita per day
Global North-South Divide:
Plastic waste emissions are highest across countries in
Southern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and South-eastern Asia
. There is a clear divide in plastic pollution sources.
Global South countries
, such as India, often rely on
open burning
for waste management, while the
uses
controlled systems,
leading to
less unmanaged waste
Disparity Between High and Low Income Countries:
Globally, 69% or 35.7 Mt per year of plastic waste emissions come from 20 countries.
In the Global South, plastic pollution mainly comes from
open burning due to poor waste management
, while in the Global North, it's mostly from
uncontrolled debris.
High-income countries
have higher plastic waste generation rates but
are not among the top 90 polluters due to 100% collection coverage
and controlled disposal.
Criticism of Research:
Narrow Focus
: The study
overemphasised waste management, neglecting
the n
eed to reduce plastic production.
Misplaced Priorities
: It could divert attention from upstream solutions like phasing out single-use plastics.
Industry Support
: Endorsement by plastics industry groups raises concerns about
aligning with industry interests rather than broader environmental goals.
Undermining Comprehensive Solutions
: The study’s focus on waste management might
weaken efforts to address production and recycling issues.

What are the Reasons for High Plastic Pollution in India?
Rapid Population Growth and Urbanization:
India's rising population and affluence drive
higher consumption and waste generation.
Urbanisation intensifies the problem by increasing the demand for plastic products and packaging.
Inadequate Waste Management Infrastructure:
waste management infrastructure is insufficient
to handle the large volumes of waste, with more uncontrolled dumping sites than sanitary landfills, reflecting
poor disposal facilities and practices.
Discrepancies in Waste Collection Data:
India's official waste collection rate is overstated at 95%, while research suggests the actual rate is around 81%, revealing a significant gap in efficiency.
Open Burning of Waste:
burns approximately 5.8 million tons of plastic waste
each year, worsening pollution and releasing toxic pollutants that pose health and environmental risks.
Informal Sector Recycling:
The unregulated informal
recycling sector handles much plastic waste not accounted for in official statistics
, complicating the understanding of plastic pollution levels.
What are the Issues Associated With Mismanaged Plastic Waste in India?
Environmental Degradation:
Plastic waste clogs waterways, leading to flooding and marine pollution. It harms marine life through ingestion, while burning it releases toxic pollutants, worsening air quality.
Public Health Concerns:
Microplastics
in water and food pose
potential long-term health risks.
Plastic waste creates
breeding grounds for disease vectors
, increasing the spread of diseases like
dengue and malaria
Burning plastic also releases harmful substances affecting respiratory health.
Economic Challenges:
According to a FICCI report, India could lose over
USD 133 billion worth of material value
used in plastic packaging by 2030, with uncollected plastic packaging waste accounting for USD 68 billion of this loss.
E-commerce and Packaging Waste:
e-commerce
growth has led to increased plastic packaging waste, much of which is difficult to recycle and ends up as litter or in landfills.
Regulatory and Enforcement Challenges
: Inconsistent enforcement of plastic waste regulations and issues with the
Extended Producer Responsibility
system hamper effective waste management.
India is among the top contributors to global plastic waste.
Microplastic Pollution in Agriculture:
Plastic use in agriculture and inadequate wastewater treatment lead to microplastics accumulating in soil, impacting soil health and food safety.
Technological and Infrastructure Gaps:
waste segregation and processing facilities
, along with
limited advanced recycling technology
, hinder effective plastic waste management. A lack of
comprehensive waste tracking
further complicates efforts.
What are the Regulations Related to Plastic Waste Management in India?
Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016
Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2018:
Applies phasing out of multi-layered plastic (MLP) to those that are non-recyclable, non-energy recoverable, or have no alternate use.
Establishes a central registration system by the
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
for producers, importers, and brand owners.
Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021: Prohibits specific single-use plastic items by 2022
due to low utility and high littering potential.
Enforces collection and environmental management of plastic packaging waste through
EPR.
Increases plastic carry bag thickness from 50 microns to 75 microns by September 2021 and to 120 microns by December 2022.

Way Forward
Circular Economy:
Promote
RRR i.e. reduce, reuse and recyclability
in design, set up recovery facilities,
incentivize recycled plastics,
and mandate recycled content in products.
Smart Waste Management:
Integrate
smart technology in waste management
IoT-
enabled bins,
AI
for sorting, and
mobile apps for reporting illegal dumping
and locating recycling centres.
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
: Strengthen EPR by introducing
graded fees for difficult-to-recycle plastics
, a plastic credit trading system, and extending EPR to the informal sector for better waste picker conditions.
Awareness Campaigns:
Launch
national campaigns
in multiple languages,
integrate plastic waste education
in schools, conduct community workshops, and use influencers to promote plastic-free lifestyles. Establish a national
innovation challenge
for youth involvement.

Adverse Effects of Lithium Mining
Source: IE
Why in News?
According to a new study, land subsidence is occurring in Chile's
Atacama salt flat
due to lithium mining.
What are the Key Revelations of the Study?
Findings:
Rate of Sinking:
The Atacama salt flat in Chile is sinking at a rate of 1 to 2 centimetres per year due to
lithium brine extraction
Lithium brine extraction involves
pumping salt-rich water
to the surface and into evaporation ponds to obtain
The sinking is caused by the extraction of lithium-rich brine at a rate faster than the natural recharge of
aquifers
, leading to subsidence.
Lithium Mining Impact on the Environment:
Water Usage:
The process requires massive amounts of fresh water, with
2,000 tons of water
needed to produce
one ton of lithium
Water Scarcity:
This extraction exacerbates
water scarcity
in the
Atacama Desert
, affecting both local communities and ecosystems.
Chemical Contamination:
Chemicals like
sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide
used in l
ithium extraction contaminate soil and water,
harming ecosystems and endangering species.
Impact on Wildlife:
A 2022 study highlighted a decline in
flamingo
populations in the Atacama region due to reduced water levels, which affect their reproduction rates.
Potential Impact of Lithium Mining in Reasi (J&K):
Water Crisis:
Many villages in
are struggling to access enough water, after
perennial streams dried
up following the construction of the
Chenab Rail Bridge.
Water-intensive lithium mining can further
worsen
the situation.
Threat to Biodiversity:
Himalayan region
in J&K is a
biodiversity hotspot
and a
eco-sensitive
region,
and mining could lead to a significant loss of biodiversity.
It can hamper
the habitat of migratory birds like Common Teal, Northern Pintail
etc who come every year to stay in lakes, marshes and
wetlands
of Jammu and Kashmir.
Food Insecurity:
Mining and processing lithium can further jeopardise
food security
through its excessive
carbon emissions,
water, and land use methods.
Pollution:
The Himalayas are the source of so many rivers and mining activity may pollute the entire
riparian ecosystem.

Typhoon Yagi
Source: IE
Recently,
has caused severe damage across
Southeast Asia,
affecting the
Philippines, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand,
and particularly
Vietnam.
It is the
strongest tropical
cyclone
has encountered till September 2024 and the second most powerful globally after
Hurricane Beryl (Atlantic Ocean).
It originated as a
tropical storm (wind speed upto 63 kmph)
in the western Philippine Sea but became
Category 5 typhoon
with winds of
260 kmph.
The
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale
categorizes tropical cyclones from
Category 1 (119-153 kmph) to Category 5 (252 kmph or higher)
. Storms reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major tropical cyclones due to their potential for significant damage."
Storm systems with winds of 119 kmph and above are classified as hurricanes, typhoons, or tropical cyclones."
India launched
Operation “Sadbhav
” to provide aid and urgent supplies to Vietnam,
Laos, and Myanmar.
Operation Sadbhav is part of India’s broader effort to contribute to
Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR)
within the
ASEAN region
, in line with its longstanding ‘
Act East Policy’.
Reasons for More Intense Typhoons:
Global mean
sea surface temperatures
have
increased
by approximately
0.9°C since 1850,
about 0.6°C
past four decades.
Higher sea surface temperatures drive
marine heat waves
and increased
evaporation,
leading to more intense typhoons that form closer to coastlines and intensify rapidly.
