DRAMATIC PERFORMANCES ACT, 1876
Syllabus:
Prelims – HISTORY
Context:
Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently asked why a colonial law, Dramatic Performances Act, 1876, continued to exist even 75 years after independence.  He was speaking of  government’s efforts to repeal archaic and obsolete laws.
Background: –
The repeal of obsolete laws has been a flagship exercise by the Modi government. Since 2014, it has repealed more than 2,000 such laws. Obsolete laws, by definition, are laws which are no longer in use.
Key takeaways
Under the Dramatic Performances Act, “any play, pantomime or other drama performed or about to be performed in a public place” could be banned if the government was of the “opinion” that the play was “of a scandalous or defamatory nature”, was “likely to excite feelings of disaffection to the Government established by law”, or “to deprave and corrupt persons present at the performance”.
This law was among those enacted by the British to clamp down on the budding Indian nationalist sentiment following the visit of the Prince of Wales, Albert Edward, to India from 1875 to 1876. Other laws enacted during this period were the draconian Vernacular Press Act, 1878, and the sedition law of 1870.
The law was formally repealed in 2018 as part of the Modi government’s exercise to weed out obsolete laws. However, the Dramatic Performance Act had not been a “valid law” since at least 1956.
In a ruling in 1956, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the law was inconsistent with the Constitution of India.
Why  India continue to have  colonial laws?
Article 372 of the Constitution states that laws in operation at the time of Independence would continue to be in operation.
However, colonial laws do not enjoy the presumption of constitutionality – which means that when a colonial law is challenged, the government must defend the law for it to be valid.
Other laws – those enacted by the Parliament of independent India – are deemed constitutional unless declared otherwise, which means that when challenged in court, the onus is on the petitioner to prove that the legislation violates the Constitution.

OFFSHORE MINING
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
The coastal communities in Kerala are currently caught in a wave of unrest following the Centre’s plans for offshore mining, which they believe will ravage the fragile marine ecosystem and bring an end to their traditional way of life.
Strong opposition erupted when proceedings to auction offshore mineral blocks began after an amendment to the Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 2002.
The 2023 amendment to the Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Bill introduced reforms allowing private sector participation in offshore mining. This includes granting production leases and composite licences through competitive auctions.
Surveys conducted by the Geological Survey of India revealed lime mud within the Exclusive Economic Zone off the Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts, construction-grade sand off Kerala coast, heavy mineral placers in the inner-shelf and mid-shelf off Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra, as well as polymetallic ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea.
At present, bids have been invited for 13 offshore areas under Tranche 1, including three blocks of lime mud off the Gujarat coast, three blocks of construction sand off the Kerala coast, and seven blocks of polymetallic nodules and crusts off the coast of Great Nicobar Island.
The three blocks selected for mining off the Kerala coast are located in ‘Kollam Parappu’ also known as Quilon Bank, one of the richest fishing zones in the southwest coast. The fishing hub is frequented by mechanised vessels, mesh gill net boats, and fishers using hook and line from both Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
An ongoing study by the University of Kerala’s Department of Aquatic Biology & Fisheries warns that mining operations can cause catastrophic damage to ecosystems, harming the livelihood of fishers.
Study observes that the diversity of solitary and soft corals in the Kollam region will be threatened by sand mining, as the extraction process will cause sediment plumes, increasing turbidity and impacting the composition of the water column. This means declining water quality, disruption of food webs, and deterioration of spawning grounds.
Apart from this, there is the need to evaluate the economic costs associated with using freshwater to wash extracted sand.

AVALANCHE
Prelims & Mains – GEOGRAPHY
Four more bodies were found on Sunday at the site of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) project in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district, which was struck by an avalanche on Friday. This takes the death toll in the avalanche to eight.
There were 54 workers at the project site when the avalanche buried the containers that the workers were using as living quarters. Forty-six of them were safely rescued.
An avalanche is a sudden and rapid flow of snow, ice, and debris down a mountain slope. It is typically triggered by natural or human-induced factors and can cause widespread destruction in mountainous regions.
Types of Avalanches:
Loose Snow Avalanche – Begins at a single point and gathers mass as it moves down.
Slab Avalanche – A large chunk of snow breaks away from the slope, making it the most dangerous type.
Powder Snow Avalanche – A mix of loose snow and air, moving at high speeds.
Wet Snow Avalanche – Occurs due to melting snow and is slower but destructive.
Causes of Avalanches:
Natural Causes:
Heavy snowfall – Increases the weight of snow layers.
Temperature variations – Weakens the snow structure.
Rainfall or melting snow – Reduces the binding strength of snow layers.
Earthquakes or volcanic eruptions – Triggers movement in snowpacks.
Human-Induced Causes:
Deforestation and land-use changes – Destabilize mountain slopes.
Vibrations from construction, mining, or explosives – Can trigger avalanches.
Adventure tourism and skiing – Disturbs snow layers in avalanche-prone regions.
Impacts of Avalanches:
Loss of Life & Infrastructure – High-risk areas include Himalayan regions (Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh).
Economic Losses – Damage to roads, power lines, and communication networks.
Environmental Degradation – Leads to deforestation, landslides, and habitat destruction.
Impact on Armed Forces – Avalanches in Siachen Glacier and high-altitude military bases cause frequent casualties.
Mitigation and Preparedness:
Avalanche Forecasting & Monitoring
Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) under DRDO provides real-time forecasts.
Use of satellite imagery and drones for early warnings.
Structural Measures
Avalanche barriers, snow sheds, and controlled blasting to prevent snow accumulation.
Afforestation & slope stabilization to reduce risks.
Disaster Management & Response
National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local agencies conduct rescue operations.
Training of armed forces and locals for avalanche preparedness.

TANTRIC BUDDHISM
Prelims & Mains – ART & CULTURE
The excavation in Odisha’s Ratnagiri has unearthed important historical details, such as Ratnagiri once being a major centre of Tantric Buddhism.
Ratnagiri is located on a hillock in the Assia hill range in Jajpur and encircled by the rivers Brahmani, Kimiria, and Birupa and their tributaries. It is part of the ‘Diamond Triangle’, a collection of three Buddhist sites — Ratnagiri, Udayagiri and Lalitgiri — located in a 10-km radius.
Tantric Buddhism, also known as Vajrayana Buddhism, is a form of Buddhism that incorporates esoteric rituals, meditation techniques, and mystical practices to attain enlightenment.
It emerged in India around the 5th to 7th centuries CE and later spread to Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and Mongolia.
Vajrayana is often referred to as the “Diamond Vehicle” because it is believed to offer a swift and powerful path to enlightenment.
Key Features of Tantric Buddhism:
Use of Tantras (Sacred Texts):
Tantric Buddhism derives its name from the Tantras, a set of esoteric scriptures that provide secretive teachings.
These texts emphasize mantras (chants), mudras (hand gestures), mandalas (sacred diagrams), and visualization techniques.
Esoteric and Mystical Practices:
Unlike Theravada and mainstream Mahayana Buddhism, Vajrayana followers believe in hidden knowledge (Guhya Vidya) accessible only through a guru (spiritual teacher).
The practice often involves meditation on deities, symbolic rituals, and transformative yogic practices.
Concept of ‘Deity Yoga’:
One of the central practices in Tantric Buddhism is Deity Yoga, where practitioners visualize themselves as a deity or Buddha figure. This practice is intended to help the practitioner embody the qualities of the deity.
Prominent deities: Avalokiteshvara (compassion), Manjushri (wisdom), Tara (protection), and Vajrapani (power).
Belief in the Vajra (Thunderbolt) and Bell: The Vajra (thunderbolt) symbolizes indestructible wisdom, while the Ghanta (bell) represents compassion. Together, they signify the union of wisdom and compassion.
Importance of Guru-Disciple Relationship: A Guru or Lama is essential in guiding followers through complex tantric practices. The lineage system is crucial, ensuring that sacred knowledge is passed down without distortion.
Historical Development of Tantric Buddhism:
Origin in India: Developed in medieval India, particularly in Bihar, Bengal, and Odisha.
Spread to Tibet (8th century CE): Indian masters like Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche) introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Tibet.
Influence in Nepal, China, and Japan: Evolved into different sects like Shingon Buddhism in Japan and Esoteric Buddhism in China.
Tantric Buddhism in India:
Flourished in Nalanda and Vikramashila universities under the Pala dynasty (8th–12th centuries CE).
Significance of Tantric Buddhism in Tibet: Tibetan Buddhism, a form of Vajrayana, developed into four major schools:
Nyingma (Oldest)
Kagyu (Meditation-focused)
Sakya (Scholarly tradition)
Gelug (Dalai Lama’s sect)
The Dalai Lama (spiritual leader of Tibet) belongs to the Gelug school.

BLUE GHOST MISSION 1
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
U.S. company Firefly Aerospace successfully landed its spacecraft on the moon on Sunday, marking only the second private mission to achieve the milestone — and the first to do so upright.
Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1 touched down shortly after 3.34 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (0204 IST) near Mons Latreille, a volcanic formation in Mare Crisium on the moon’s northeastern near side.
The mission is part of a NASA-industry partnership aimed at reducing costs and supporting Artemis, the programme designed to return astronauts to the moon.
Blue Ghost carries 10 instruments, including a lunar soil analyser, a radiation-tolerant computer and an experiment testing the feasibility of using the existing global satellite navigation system to navigate the Moon.
Designed to operate for a full lunar day (14 earth days), Blue Ghost is expected to capture high-definition imagery of a total eclipse on March 14, when the earth blocks the sun from the moon’s horizon.
On March 16, it will record a lunar sunset, offering insights into how dust levitates above the surface under solar influence — creating the mysterious lunar horizon glow first documented by Apollo astronaut Eugene Cernan.
Blue Ghost’s arrival will be followed on March 6 by fellow Texas company Intuitive Machines’ IM-2 mission, featuring its lander Athena.
In February 2024, Intuitive Machines became the first private company to achieve a soft lunar landing — also the first U.S. landing since the crewed Apollo 17 mission of 1972.
However, the success was tempered by a mishap: the lander came down too fast and tipped over on impact, leaving it unable to generate enough solar power and cutting the mission short.
Until Intuitive Machines’ first successful mission, only five national space agencies had accomplished this feat: the Soviet Union, the United States, China, India and Japan, in that order.

**********Making Sense of GDP Data
Why in news?
The Indian government released the latest
estimates, measuring the country's economic growth. GDP represents the market value of all goods and services produced within India over a quarter or financial year.
This article focuses on real GDP, which accounts for inflation and is calculated at constant price (Nominal GDP is calculated at current prices).
Q2 of FY25
(July–September), GDP growth fell to 5.4%, signalling a sharp slowdown in India's economic momentum, surprising many observers.
What’s in today’s article?
Advance estimates of GDP
MoSPI's GDP Estimates Release
Significance of the Sharp GDP Revision
Key Takeaways
The financial year ends on
March 31
, so any GDP estimate before that is a
forecast
or an
advance estimate
of economic output.
Five rounds of GDP estimates
First Advance Estimates (FAE):
Based on Q1 (April–June) and Q2 (July–September) data. It is released in January of the relevant financial year.
Second Advance Estimates (SAE):
Incorporates Q3 (October–December) data, making it a more reliable estimate. It is released in February of the same year.
Additional Revisions in SAE:
SAE includes the First Revised Estimates (FRE) for the preceding financial year, providing a clearer economic picture.
Provisional Estimates (PE):
Released in
May
, refining SAE projections.
It is released in May, includes Q4 data (January-March).
First Revised Estimates (FRE):
Published in
February 2026
, further updating GDP data.
It is released in February the following year.
Final Estimates
– Released in February, two years later.
Thus, while
SAE offers a better estimate
, GDP figures continue to be revised for greater accuracy.
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) released three sets of GDP estimates:
GDP for the third quarter (October to December) of the ongoing financial year
- It determines if the Q2 slump was temporary or a trend.
GDP forecast for the full year (Second Advance Estimates - SAE)
- Projects GDP growth by March 31.
GDP estimates for the preceding two financial years
- These include the First Revised Estimates (FRE) of FY24 and the Final Estimates of FY23
Key GDP Updates
Quarterly GDP
Q3 GDP grew by 6.2% (YoY).
Q2 GDP growth revised up from 5.4% to 5.6%.
Annual GDP
FY24 GDP revised from 8.2% to 9.2%.
FAE for FY24 had initially projected 7.3% growth.
FY23 GDP revised from 7% to 7.6%.
FY24 GDP growth was revised up by 1.9 percentage points
, a larger revision than even the COVID year (FY21).
Private Consumption Demand
Initially estimated at
4% growth
in FY24,
revised up to 5.6%
This indicates
stronger consumer demand
than previously thought.
FY25, private consumption
is the
primary driver of GDP growth
, exceeding government and private sector investments.
GDP data serve as the foundation for understanding India's economy. Weaker GDP data imply:
Lower tax collections for the government.
Lower corporate profits, which impact stock markets.
One major reason why foreign investors are pulling out of Indian stock markets is the slump in corporate earnings.
India’s economy performed better than expected until March 2024.
GDP growth slowdown in FY25 is sharper than estimated, declining from 9.2% to 6.5%.
Frequent and large GDP revisions affect the credibility of official data and economic assessments.

The Act was enacted by the British government to suppress nationalist sentiment in India, particularly after the visit of the Prince of Wales (1875-76).
It was part of a broader crackdown that included the Vernacular Press Act (1878) and the sedition law (1870).
Key Provisions
Ban on Performances
: The government could prohibit
any play, pantomime, or drama
in public if deemed
Government’s Discretion
: The ban was based on the government’s
opinion
, without the need for concrete proof.
Search and Seizure Powers
: Magistrates could
search and seize
venues suspected of hosting prohibited performances.
Punishment
: Violators faced
up to three months in jail
, a
fine
, or both.
The Act was formally repealed in 2018 by then government as part of an effort to remove obsolete laws.
The Modi government undertook a flagship exercise to repeal obsolete laws, aiming to improve ease of doing business.
Since 2014, over 2,000 obsolete laws have been repealed
Although the Dramatic Performances Act, 1876, was declared unconstitutional and no longer in use, it was formally repealed by Parliament through the Repealing and Amending (Second) Act, 2017.
However, it had not been a valid law since 1956 due to its inconsistency with the Indian Constitution.
Judicial Rulings
Allahabad High Court (1956)
: In State vs. Baboo Lal and Ors., the court ruled the law unconstitutional.
Madras High Court (2013)
: Struck down the
Tamil Nadu Dramatic Performances Act, 1954
State-Level Implementation
Some states, including
Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu
, had enacted similar laws.
These laws were later
repealed in several states and Union Territories
, including Delhi.
Background of the Case (1953)
The Lucknow branch of the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA) planned to stage a play based on Munshi Premchand’s short story Idgah (1938).
Initially, the theatre group received permission, but the Lucknow magistrate later revoked it without explanation.
The prohibitory order was served mid-performance, but the artists continued the play, leading to legal action.
Allahabad High Court’s Approach
Instead of focusing on the specific facts of the case, the court examined
the constitutionality of the Dramatic Performances Act, 1876
It referred to previous rulings where
colonial-era laws violating fundamental rights
had been struck down or modified.
Key Court Ruling (1956)
The court declared the Act
, stating that its
procedural restrictions
on free speech and expression violated
Article 19(1)(a)
of the Indian Constitution.
The law
did not meet the “reasonable restrictions” criteria
Article 19(2)
The ruling also acknowledged concerns that the case could be an instance of
political victimization
Continuation of Colonial-Era Laws in India - Reasons
Continuity Under Article 372
Article 372 of the Constitution states that laws in force at the time of Independence would continue unless repealed or amended.
Lack of Presumption of Constitutionality
Colonial laws are not presumed constitutional. When challenged, the government must justify their validity.
In contrast, laws enacted by independent India’s Parliament are presumed constitutiona
, and the burden of proof lies on the petitioner to show they violate the Constitution.
Government Defenses of Colonial Laws
Successive governments, including Congress-led ones, have defended preventive detention laws and those declaring unlawful associations.
The current government has:
Retained the sedition law
, renaming it under the
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita
Defended the marital rape exception
, a colonial-era provision, which is currently under challenge in the Supreme Court.

**********Review of PLI Scheme 5 Years On
Why in the News?
With the first phase of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme showing progress, the Central government is exploring the modifications in PLI 2.0 Scheme.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context)
About PLI Scheme (Overview, Challenges, PLI 2.0, Comparisons, etc.)
The
, introduced in April 2020, aims to enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities and attract global companies to set up production facilities in the country.
Covering 14 sectors, the scheme incentivizes incremental sales to drive manufacturing growth.
However, five years into its implementation,
the government is considering modifications for PLI 2.0
, linking incentives to additional metrics such as
domestic value addition and incremental exports
Overview of the PLI Scheme
The PLI scheme was launched with the following key objectives:
Boost domestic manufacturing and reduce import dependence.
Attract
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
and contract manufacturers.
Encourage investment in
high-tech sectors like electronics, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and specialty steel
Enhance
India’s participation in global supply chains
Create employment and promote skill development in manufacturing.
The scheme has seen
notable success
in sectors such as mobile phones, pharmaceuticals, and food processing. However, in certain sectors like
IT hardware, advanced chemicals, textiles, and specialty steel
, progress has been slower than expected.
Challenges in the Existing PLI Framework
Low Value Addition:
Even in successful sectors like mobile manufacturing, the percentage of local value addition remains
in single digits
Critical components such as semiconductor chips and subassemblies
are still imported.
Limited Domestic Market Size:
Sectors like
telecom and electronics
do not generate sufficient demand to encourage large-scale local manufacturing.
Export-led growth
is essential to drive economies of scale.
Foreign vs. Domestic Players:
Indian manufacturers
struggle with cost competitiveness
compared to their
Chinese and Vietnamese counterparts
access to international markets
and lower technological capability
reduce India’s bargaining power in the global supply chain
Dependency on Foreign OEMs:
Currently, global players
drive the manufacturing ecosystem
, while Indian firms remain dependent on them for critical technologies.
Lack of indigenous R&D investment in
semiconductors, specialty steel, and advanced chemical cells
remains a key hurdle.
PLI 2.0: Proposed Reforms for Sustainable Growth
address these challenges and refine the PLI scheme
, policymakers are considering several key reforms:
Linking Incentives to Value Addition
Instead of rewarding companies solely based on incremental sales, PLI 2.0 proposes
higher incentives for firms that achieve a greater percentage of domestic value addition
. This includes:
Promoting
localization of key components
like semiconductors and printed circuit boards (PCBs).
Supporting
indigenous R&D and manufacturing
to reduce import dependence.
Export-Oriented Incentives
To make Indian manufacturers globally competitive, PLI 2.0 aims to
link incentives with export performance
, ensuring:
Increased production volumes.
A globally competitive
cost structure
through economies of scale.
Enhanced participation in
international value chains
Strengthening Local Component Manufacturing
One of the
biggest limitations of the current PLI scheme
is the
lack of a robust component ecosystem
. Proposed measures include:
Encouraging
joint ventures with global companies
to build an ecosystem for
sub-components and advanced manufacturing
Ensuring
foreign OEMs help in technology transfer and capacity building
for local manufacturers.
Supporting MSMEs and Domestic Players
Large-scale manufacturers dominate the PLI scheme, while
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) struggle to compete
. New reforms may focus on:
Special incentives for
domestic MSMEs
engaged in component manufacturing.
Credit support and infrastructure development to help small firms integrate into global supply chains.
Focus on Semiconductor Manufacturing
Given the global semiconductor shortage and
India’s reliance on imports
, the government is expected to:
Provide
stronger incentives for semiconductor fabrication units (fabs)
Push for the development of
indigenous chip design and assembly capabilities
Comparisons with Global Manufacturing Strategies
India’s PLI strategy is
inspired by the industrial policies of nations like China, Japan, and South Korea
. These countries:
Leveraged foreign OEMs to develop domestic ecosystems.
Focused on technology transfer and local skill development.
Used exports as a growth driver to build global manufacturing hubs.
For instance, China’s electric vehicle (EV) industry was strengthened by allowing Tesla to establish manufacturing units. This move helped local suppliers improve their quality and capacity, eventually boosting homegrown brands like BYD, Li Auto, and Nio.
India is now
trying to replicate this model
by using PLI to
attract foreign investment while also developing domestic manufacturing capabilities
Conclusion
The PLI scheme has
set India on the path to becoming a global manufacturing hub
, but challenges remain in
scaling up, increasing local value addition, and making domestic firms globally competitive
. As discussions on
progress, the government aims to introduce reforms that
prioritize exports, component localization, and MSME support
With the right policy interventions, India can
bridge gaps in the supply chain, improve competitiveness, and establish itself as a leader in global manufacturing

**********Transforming Indian Cities - Challenges and the Road Ahead
Context:
Indian cities face
severe pollution
, poor infrastructure, and inadequate public services. Without reforms, cities risk becoming unlivable and unsafe.
Urban Challenges in India:
Rapid urbanization:
According to the 2011 Census
, census towns increased from 1,362 in 2001 to 3,894 in 2011, contributing to nearly one-third of the urban growth during that decade.
By 2036
, more than 600 million people will live in Indian cities, which are not ready for this growth.
Pollution crisis:
Overview:
42 Indian cities are among the top 50 most polluted cities in the world. Nearly 50% of 603 rivers in India are polluted.
Major causes:
Vehicle emissions, industrial waste, and construction dust.
Impact:
Respiratory diseases, economic losses ($95 billion annually), and deteriorating quality of life.
Climate change and environmental degradation:
Extreme weather events (heatwaves, floods) are becoming frequent.
For example,
Mumbai and Bengaluru
witnessed flooding and waterlogging (last year), disrupting everyday life and displacing thousands.
New Delhi
and the rest of North India endured a heatwave with temperatures touching close to 50 degrees Celsius.
Causes:
Lack of green infrastructure worsens urban heat and flooding.
Water and waste mismanagement:
Major rivers like the
Yamuna and Ganga
are heavily contaminated, making them unsafe for consumption and harmful for marine biodiversity.
, lakes have either dried up or become toxic while floods in
Chennai
have worsened groundwater contamination, leading to a cutoff of clean water supply for many communities.
Less than one-fifth of waste is treated in India.
Cities like Bengaluru and Chennai struggle with
water scarcity and contamination.
Poor waste disposal leads to
hazardous landfills and disease outbreaks.
Governance Issues and Urban Planning:
Census towns and urban mismanagement:
Census towns exhibit urban characteristics but lack official recognition.
Their governance as rural areas leads to
poor infrastructure and funding shortages.
Delayed urban status exacerbates
regional inequalities
Comparing Indian cities to global urban centers:
Bangkok:
Efficient metro, tourism-friendly policies.
London:
Well-planned transport, cultural hubs.
Dubai:
Investment-friendly urban planning.
Singapore:
Clean governance, smart city initiatives.
Lessons for India:
Key takeaways for India:
Efficient governance, affordable housing, and green infrastructure. To achieve this and to compete globally,
Indian cities need bold urban reform.
Learning from Singapore’s urban model:
Singapore overcame overcrowding, pollution, and congestion through structured urban planning.
Solutions and Policy Interventions:
Solutions:
cities will require an overhaul of planning, strengthened governance, and sustainable financing.
With action on these fronts, India can
develop liveable, resilient, and economically vibrant cities
that can become global attractions.
The first step
must be to notify census towns as urban areas in their own right. States must take the lead.
Other solutions:
Green spaces
(like parks and green roofs), modern drainage systems, and early warning systems.
Need for comprehensive
waste and water management
Recent government initiative:
Urban Challenge Fund
(Rs 1 lakh crore) announced in the 2025-26 Union Budget.
Focus areas:
Cities as growth hubs, creative redevelopment, and sanitation improvements.
Cities must compete to achieve sustainability through transit investments and pollution control.
Conclusion:
The fate of Indian cities depends on
proactive planning and governance reforms.
Without urgent action, cities will face worsening pollution, congestion, and insecurity.
The coming decade is crucial for making Indian cities smart, green, and globally competitive.

**********Centring Care in India’s Economic Policy
Context
The
Union Budget 2025 has marked a significant milestone in gender-responsive fiscal policies
by allocating a record ₹4,49,028.68 crore to the Gender Budget (GB), reflecting a 37.3% increase from the previous year.
This
allocation represents 8.86% of the total Budget
, indicating a
growing recognition of gender-related economic issues.
However, a closer analysis reveals that this increase is
primarily attributed to the inclusion of the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which alone accounts for 24% of the GB.
Crucially,
this rise does not stem from substantial investments in care infrastructure or new gender-responsive programs
, highlighting persistent gaps in addressing unpaid care and domestic work (UCDW) in India’s economic planning.
The Care Work Crisis: An Overlooked Economic Reality
The Issue of Unpaid Labour
Globally, women disproportionately shoulder the burden
of unpaid care work, spending an average of
17.8% of their time on such activities.
imbalance is even more severe in the Global South
, where women in countries like India face an exacerbated care burden.
Indian women, in particular, spend 40% more time on unpaid care
and domestic work compared to their counterparts in South Africa and China.
International Labour Organisation (ILO) reports that 53% of Indian women remain outside the formal labour force
due to caregiving responsibilities, compared to a mere 1.1% of men.
striking disparity underscores the deeply entrenched gender norms
that confine women to unpaid labour, limiting their economic participation and reinforcing systemic inequalities.
The Heavy Burden on Marginalised Women
For marginalised women in low-income households, the situation is even more dire.
Many juggle 17–19 hours of daily labour
, balancing paid employment with domestic responsibilities.
This results in
‘time poverty,’
where women lack the time to invest in personal development, economic opportunities
, or leisure, leading to significant health and well-being challenges.
Feminist economists from the Global South emphasise that
unpaid work in these regions extends beyond household duties to include family farm work,
water and fuel collection, and sanitation-related tasks.
Limited access to essential infrastructure forces women to spend up to 73% of their time on unpaid care activities,
a reality exacerbated by climate change.
For instance, water-related unpaid labour in India is projected to cost $1.4 billion by 2050 under high-emission scenarios, a direct consequence of
inadequate public investment in care infrastructure.
Missed Opportunities in Budget 2025
Despite its record allocation,
the Gender Budget for 2025 fails to make transformative investments in care infrastructure
that could alleviate the burden on women.
Economic Surveys of 2023-24 and 2024-25 recognise care infrastructure as a cornerstone of women’s empowerment,
yet the Budget does not translate this understanding into concrete fiscal measures.
India’s continued oversight of the care economy reflects a broader global pattern
where unpaid labour remains largely invisible in mainstream economic planning.
A key recommendation from the Economic Survey 2023-24 is that a direct public investment of 2% of GDP
in care infrastructure could generate 11 million jobs while reducing the care burden.
the Budget does not take concrete steps toward this goal.
Policy Recommendations: The Three R Framework
Recognizing Unpaid Care and Domestic Work
Recognition is the first step toward addressing unpaid labour.
India’s 2019 Time Use Survey marked a milestone in quantifying the time women spend on UCDW,
revealing an average of seven hours per day.
However, conducting such surveys regularly is expensive.
A cost-effective solution would be integrating time-use modules into existing household surveys
to systematically track unpaid work and inform policy decisions.
Reducing the Burden Through Infrastructure Investments
Reducing women’s care burden requires significant investments in time-saving technologies and affordable care services.
government’s decision to extend the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) until 2028 is a positive step
toward addressing gaps in water access, a major contributor to unpaid labour.
funding delays and underutilisation continue to hinder its implementation.
While the scheme’s budget saw a 195% increase over Revised Estimates (RE),
it declined by 4.51% from last year’s Budget Estimates (BE),
highlighting allocation-spending mismatches.
Stronger implementation measures and sustainability initiatives are necessary to ensure that women benefit from improved water access.
Redistributing Care Work Beyond Households
Redistributing care responsibilities, from households to the State and society—is essential for achieving gender equality.
newly announced ₹1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund, with ₹10,000 crore allocated for FY 2025-26, presents an opportunity
to finance urban redevelopment projects, including water and sanitation improvements.
If leveraged effectively,
this fund could help establish care infrastructure in urban centres, taking inspiration from Bogotá’s Care Blocks,
which consolidate caregiving services to reduce women’s unpaid work.
Similar models could be integrated into India’s Smart Cities Mission
to create gender-responsive urban spaces.
The Way Forward: The Need for Women’s Representation in Policy-Making
Ensuring women’s representation in decision-making processes is critical
to designing policies that reflect their lived experiences.
Excluding women from policy formulation results in economic strategies that fail to address gender-specific challenges.
Studies suggest that
policies designed with women’s participation are six to seven times more effective in achieving gender-equitable outcomes.
By encouragement of greater female leadership in governance, India can enhance the responsiveness and effectiveness of its gender policies.
Conclusion
With its emphasis on Nari Shakti as a driver of economic growth,
India has the potential to emerge as a global leader in gender-responsive economic planning.
the 2025 Budget falls short of making care infrastructure a central pillar
of its strategy.
Recognising unpaid care work, investing in time-saving infrastructure,
and redistributing caregiving responsibilities are
critical steps in creating an inclusive economy.

Editorial Analysis
**********The Student and the Three Language Debate
Context
Language policy in education has always been a contentious issue in India
, and the debate surrounding the three-language formula is no exception.
While the National Education Policy (NEP) advocates the introduction of a third language
to enhance cognitive ability, mobility for employment, and national integration,
several issues arise with this approach.
These include the
practical difficulties of implementation, the prioritisation of foundational learning,
and the potential political ramifications of language imposition.
A careful assessment of these factors is necessary
to ensure that educational reforms genuinely serve students rather than becoming political battlegrounds.
The Core Issue: Student Welfare and Educational Equity
The first and foremost concern in the
three-language debate should be the student, particularly those enrolled in public schools.
Public school students form a significant percentage
of the total school enrolment in Tamil Nadu, yet
they lack access to coaching and other learning resources
available to their counterparts in private schools.
The key question,
therefore, is whether learning an additional language will significantly enhance their career prospects.
Given the existing challenges in public education, such as poor literacy levels and inadequate teaching quality,
the introduction of a third language might divert attention from addressing more fundamental problems in education
Questioning the Hypothesis: Does Learning a Third Language Offer Real Benefits?
Cognitive Development: Is More Always Better?
One of the main arguments in favour of learning multiple languages is
that it enhances cognitive abilities.
There is
strong evidence that bilingualism has cognitive benefits, including improved memory, problem-solving skills
, and multitasking abilities.
However,
research does not conclusively support the idea
that adding a third language enhances these cognitive abilities proportionally.
In fact,
some studies suggest that introducing a third language too early, especially before a strong foundation
in the mother tongue is established, can create cognitive overload and hinder overall academic performance.
Employment Mobility: A Theoretical vs. Practical Advantage
NEP suggests that learning a third language will improve students’ ability to move across states
for employment.
While this argument holds some validity in an increasingly interconnected world,
the practical benefits of knowing a third language depend on the specific employment opportunities
For instance,
in Tamil Nadu, most students seek employment within the state
, where Tamil is the dominant language of communication.
Even for national-level jobs, English remains the preferred medium
for competitive exams, higher education, and professional settings.
Fields such as IT, engineering, medical sciences,
and business primarily
require strong English proficiency rather than fluency in Hindi
or any other regional language.
National Integration: Language vs. Cultural Understanding
Another major justification for the three-language policy is that
it creates national unity by enabling communication
between people from different linguistic backgrounds.
While linguistic diversity can promote cultural understanding,
language alone is not the primary factor in fostering national integration.
Respect for diverse cultures, shared historical narratives, and common civic values play a far greater role in uniting a nation.
Moreover,
the idea that enforcing a third language will lead to greater national integration is debatable.
India has a long history of linguistic diversity,
and different regions have developed strong cultural and linguistic identities.
Rather than imposing a particular language,
nurturing respect for multiple languages and cultures
would be a more effective approach.
The Ground Reality of Public Education
Another critical issue is the
already struggling state of primary and secondary education in Tamil Nadu, as highlighted by the ASER Survey 2024.
significant portion of students lack basic literacy skills even in their first and second languages
, making the addition of a third language an unnecessary burden.
second-language proficiency, particularly in English, is already a major challenge
for many students.
Even top-performing students from English-medium public schools struggle with higher education
due to inadequate exposure to English instruction.
he priority, therefore, should be on improving the quality of teaching and learning
rather than increasing the language load.
Practical Challenges in Implementation of Three Language Policy
The implementation of a three-language formula
raises serious logistical concerns. Public schools already face teacher shortages and infrastructure deficits.
Recruiting competent teachers
for a third language, particularly if multiple language options are offered, would strain educational budgets further.
With Tamil Nadu already spending a significant percentage of its education budget on teacher salaries,
diverting funds to accommodate third-language instruction could reduce resources available for critical infrastructure improvements.
Political Dimensions and the Way Forward
The debate over language education is also
influenced by political factors.
Tamil Nadu has historically resisted the imposition of Hindi,
viewing it as a threat to linguistic and cultural identity.
the political stance on language policy should not come at the cost of students' career prospects.
A rigid opposition to Hindi could disadvantage students
if national employment and educational opportunities begin favouring Hindi proficiency.
A balanced approach would be to introduce Hindi as an optional third language at the middle-school level,
starting in district headquarters and expanding based on demand.
This
gradual implementation would allow flexibility
without burdening all students unnecessarily.
The focus should remain on improving English proficiency and overall educational quality
while ensuring that language policy decisions are made in students' best interests.
Conclusion
The three-language formula, while well-intentioned, presents more challenges
than benefits, especially for public school students.
Rather than imposing a third language,
efforts should be directed toward enhancing teaching quality, improving literacy levels,
and ensuring
students gain proficiency in languages that offer the best career opportunities.
A pragmatic approach, rather than a rigid stance,
will ensure that Tamil Nadu’s students are not left behind in an increasingly competitive world.

?
Today’s editorial discusses the introduction of a third language in academics and its potential impact. This topic is relevant for

_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Forcing students to learn a third language has no academic benefit and may create a generation unable to compete at the national level.
What is the Three-Language Formula?
typically refers to an additional language that students learn in school beyond their
mother tongue
(first language) and
English
(second language).
In India, the
was introduced under the
National Education Policy (NEP)
to promote multilingualism and national integration.
Does learning three languages instead of two really help public school students compete with wealthier peers in the job market and become productive citizens?
Limited Practical Advantage:
Learning a third language may not directly improve job prospects if core skills like
English proficiency
technical knowledge
are weak.
Example:
In national-level exams like
banking tests
, fluency in English is more valuable than knowing a third language like Hindi.
Unequal Access to Resources:
Public school students often
lack access to quality teaching
for a third language, unlike wealthier peers in private schools.
A private school student can afford
Hindi tuition
, while a public school student relying only on classroom instruction may
fall behind
Diverts Focus from Essential Skills:
Adding a third language may
reduce time
spent on improving critical subjects like
math, science, and literacy
, which are key for future employment.
According to
ASER 2024
88% of Class 3 students
in Tamil Nadu lack basic literacy—introducing a third language could
widen this gap
What is the primary concern regarding the three-language formula for public school students in Tamil Nadu?
Increased Educational Burden:
Public school students, who lack access to private coaching, face
added pressure
from learning a third language.
A child from a rural public school struggling with basic literacy in Tamil and English may find learning Hindi an
additional challenge
, reducing focus on core subjects.
Inequality in Educational Access: Privileged
students from private schools can afford
supplemental learning
(e.g., tuition), while public school students cannot.
A private school student can attend Hindi tuition, but a public school student relying solely on classroom instruction may fall behind.
Poor Educational Infrastructure:
Public schools
lack qualified teachers
to effectively teach a third language, which may lower educational quality.
Despite Tamil Nadu’s high education budget, 80-90% is spent on
teacher salaries
, leaving minimal funds for hiring new Hindi teachers or improving resources.
Impact on Learning Outcomes:
Introducing a third language
diverts time
from improving essential skills like
literacy and numeracy
, especially when foundational learning is weak.
in Tamil Nadu lack basic literacy skills—adding a third language may further dilute learning time.
Reduced National Competitiveness:
Without strong English proficiency, public school students may
struggle
in national-level exams and job markets where English is dominant.
Tamil Nadu students competing for
central services
exams (UPSC) or jobs requiring English proficiency may be at a
disadvantage
if the focus shifts to Hindi instead of improving English skills.
Could learning a third language fail to improve cognitive abilities?
Arguments in favour:
Cognitive Overload:
Introducing a third language can overwhelm students, especially when
in the first and second languages is weak.
Public school students struggling with Tamil and English may face
cognitive strain
, reducing their ability to master essential subjects.
Weak Foundation in Mother Tongue:
Research suggests that
proficiency in the mother tongue
is crucial for cognitive development before introducing additional languages.
A child who lacks fluency in Tamil may
to grasp complex concepts in Hindi, leading to
weaker overall comprehension
Limited Evidence of Cognitive Gains:
While bilingualism enhances cognitive skills, there is
no conclusive evidence
that learning a third language improves cognitive abilities
proportionately
Studies show that
depth of understanding
in one or two languages is more beneficial than
surface-level knowledge
of multiple languages.
Arguments against:
How can child development be balanced with political concerns about language education?
Optional Third Language Policy:
Offer the third language as an
optional subject
rather than making it mandatory, allowing students to choose based on their interests and future needs.
Tamil Nadu could introduce
as an optional third language from middle school, especially in urban areas where demand is higher.
Focus on Core Language Proficiency:
Prioritize
strong literacy
in the mother tongue and English to ensure foundational learning before adding an additional language.
Strengthening
instruction in public schools will help students succeed in national-level competitive exams.
Context-Sensitive Implementation:
Implement language policies that
reflect local realities
and employment trends without compromising cultural identity.
In Tamil Nadu, where most job opportunities are available locally,
bilingual education
(Tamil and English) may be more practical than adding a third language.
Equity in Language Resources:
Ensure
adequate teacher training
and educational materials for any third language to avoid disadvantaging public school students.
Hiring
qualified Hindi teachers
and providing
multilingual textbooks
can ensure that students receive quality education if they choose a third language.
Flexible Language Learning Pathways:
Allow
regional flexibility
in adopting the three-language formula, adapting to the
socio-political landscape
while prioritizing student welfare.
Tamil Nadu could adopt a
phased approach
, starting with voluntary third-language instruction in
district headquarters
and expanding based on demand.
Way forward:
Strengthen Bilingual Education First:
Focus on improving
Tamil and English proficiency
in public schools to ensure students develop strong foundational skills before introducing a third language.
Flexible and Inclusive Language Policy:
Implement a
voluntary third-language framework
, allowing students the
choice
to learn an additional language based on
regional needs
career aspirations
**********Centring care in India’s economic policy

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Gender Budgeting;
Why in the News?
The Union Budget for 2025 allocated ₹4,49,028.68 crore to the Gender Budget (GB), which is 37.3% more than the previous year and makes up 8.86% of the total Budget.
What is the primary reason for the significant increase in the Gender Budget (GB) for 2025?
Inclusion of PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY):
This welfare scheme accounts for
24%
of the total Gender Budget.
Example:
The free food grain distribution under PMGKAY, aimed at ensuring food security for vulnerable women-led households, significantly inflated the Gender Budget.
Broadening the Definition of Gender-Responsive Schemes:
The inclusion of
non-traditional
gender-related welfare programs increases the allocation.
Programs like
Poshan Abhiyaan
(nutrition for women and children) and
Ujjwala Yojana
(LPG subsidies) are now categorized under the Gender Budget.
Increased Focus on Welfare Distribution Over Structural Investments:
The rise is
driven by consumption-based welfare
rather than care infrastructure.
Higher allocations for schemes providing
direct benefits
like the
Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(maternity support) rather than investment in childcare centers.
Political Commitment to “Nari Shakti”:
Emphasis on
women’s empowerment
as a core pillar of economic growth.
The Budget’s narrative aligns with promoting women-led development under the
“Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam”
(Women’s Reservation Bill).
Inclusion of Large-Scale Social Security Programs:
Integrating
social protection
schemes under the Gender Budget increases the total value.
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)
allocations, where a significant portion targets
women beneficiaries
, contribute to the budget rise.
How does it impact investments in care infrastructure?
Limited Direct Investment in Care Services:
Despite the rise in overall allocation,
no substantial funding
is directed toward expanding childcare, eldercare, or healthcare services.
There is
no new budgetary provision
for increasing
anganwadi
centers or community-based eldercare facilities.
Invisibility of Unpaid Care Work:
The focus on
consumption-based schemes
overlooks the need to
reduce and redistribute
unpaid care responsibilities.
While food security programs like
provide relief, they
do not alleviate
the physical and time-intensive care work that women perform daily.
Missed Opportunity for Systemic Reform:
The absence of targeted funding means there is
no structural change
in care-related infrastructure despite policy acknowledgments.
Jal Jeevan Mission
(JJM), which could reduce women’s water-fetching burden, faced a
4.51% budget cut
, limiting its expansion.
Inadequate Support for Working Women:
Without investments in affordable care services, women’s participation in the
formal workforce
remains restricted.
Lack of childcare facilities
prevents many women from rejoining the labor market after childbirth.
Uneven Urban-Rural Access:
Existing care infrastructure investments are
urban-centric
, leaving rural women without essential support systems.
Urban Challenge Fund
focuses on urban care models, while rural areas lack similar investments, exacerbating
time poverty
for women in low-income households.
Why do a majority of Indian women remain outside the labour force?
Unpaid Care and Domestic Work (UCDW) Burden:
Indian women perform a
disproportionate share
of unpaid care work, limiting their time and ability to engage in paid employment.
According to the
ILO
53% of Indian women
remain outside the labour force due to care responsibilities, compared to just
1.1% of men
Lack of Care Infrastructure: Inadequate access
to childcare, eldercare, and basic services increases women’s household workload, preventing workforce participation.
Less than half
of Indian villages have
functional tap water
, requiring women to spend
hours fetching water
Gendered Social Norms and Stereotypes:
Deep-rooted
cultural expectations
frame women as primary caregivers, discouraging their entry or return to the workforce.
Women in
households juggle
17-19 hours
of unpaid and paid work, reinforcing
and limiting job opportunities.
Lack of Formal Sector Opportunities:
There are
limited job options
offering
flexible work
and safe working conditions suited to women’s needs, particularly in rural areas.
Women’s participation
formal economy
remains low due to
insecure jobs
lack of family-friendly policies
Which measures does the Economic Survey 2023-24 propose to reduce the unpaid care work burden?
Increased Public Investment in Care Infrastructure:
Advocates for
direct public investment
equivalent to
2% of GDP
to expand care services and reduce the unpaid care burden.
This investment could
create 11 million jobs
while providing essential care support like
childcare and eldercare
Integration of Time-Use Surveys in Policy Planning:
Recommends
integrating Time-Use modules
into existing household surveys to
recognise
the extent of unpaid care work.
Data from
India’s 2019 Time Use Survey
revealed that women spend an average of
7 hours daily
on unpaid care tasks.
Expanding Access to Time-Saving Technologies:
Emphasizes improving access to
time-saving infrastructure
like clean water, sanitation, and energy to reduce the physical burden on women.
Extending the
aims to achieve
100% potable water
coverage by
2028
, easing the water-fetching burden.
Way forward:
Enhance Care Infrastructure Investment:
Prioritize increased funding for community-based childcare, eldercare, and healthcare services, especially in rural areas, to reduce women’s unpaid care burden and improve workforce participation.
Implement Gender-Sensitive Policy Planning:
Institutionalize time-use surveys for evidence-based policymaking and integrate care responsibilities into labor policies to promote equitable access to formal employment for women.

**********Article 136 of the Indian Constitution
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Vice President
Jagdeep Dhankhar recently raised concerns over the
wide usage of Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) under Article 136
of the Indian Constitution, stating that what was meant to be a
“narrow slit” has now turned into a wide judicial intervention.
What is a Special Leave Petition (SLP) under Article 136?
A SLP is
an extraordinary appeal mechanism
that allows the
Supreme Court (SC)
to intervene in any judgment, decree, or order passed by a
lower court or tribunal
, except in matters related to the
Armed Forces Tribunal
SLP is discretionary
, meaning the
SC is NOT obligated to hear every petition
filed under Article 136.
The concept of SLP
originates from the Government of India Act, 1935
, which gave a similar power to the
Privy Council
in colonial times.
Key Features of SLP:
Jurisdiction of Article 136:
The SC has the power to grant special leave to appeal against judgments of
High Courts, tribunals, or other judicial bodies
This allows the SC to
examine cases that may not have a direct appeal provision
under law.
Scope of Application:
SLPs can be filed in
both civil and criminal cases.
It can be used even in cases where a
High Court refuses to grant a certificate of appeal to the Supreme Court
The SC may accept or reject an SLP
without providing reasons
Time Limit for Filing:
90 days
from the date of the High Court’s judgment.
60 days
if the High Court refuses to certify an appeal.
Judicial Discretion:
SLP is not an automatic right of appeal
but is granted only in cases where the SC finds that a
substantial question of law or injustice
is involved.
Even if an SLP is accepted, the SC may later
decline to interfere in the final decision
Conversion into a Formal Appeal:
If the SC
grants leave
under an SLP, the case
turns into a full-fledged appeal
, allowing both parties to present their arguments.
