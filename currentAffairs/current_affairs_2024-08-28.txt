What is a Quasar?
Using the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT), astronomers recently identified a quasar described as the "brightest of its kind" and the "most luminous object ever observed.
About Quasar:
A quasar is an
extremely active
luminous type of
Active Galactic Nucleus
AGN
).
An AGN is
nothing more than
a supermassive black hole
that is active and feeding at the center of a galaxy.
All quasars are AGNs
, but
not all AGNs are quasars.
Quasar is short for
quasi-stellar radio source
because astronomers first discovered quasars in 1963 as objects that looked like stars but emitted radio waves.
Quasars are
intense sources of X-rays
as well as visible light
. They are the
most powerful type of X-ray source
yet discovered.
They are among the
most luminous, powerful, and vibrant objects
known in the universe.
How are they formed?
Quasars are thought to form in regions of the universe where the large-scale density of matter is much higher than average.
active galaxy
is one in which the
central supermassive black hole
consuming large amounts of matter
infall of matter into the black hole
is so great that all the material can't enter the black hole at the same time, so it
forms a queue
as a spiralling accretion disk.
—in the
form of huge clouds
falls into the disk
, with the inner parts of the cloud closer to the black hole orbiting faster than the outer parts (just like planets closer to the sun orbit faster than those farther away).
This creates a shear force that twists the clouds, causing them to bump into their neighbours as they move around the black hole at velocities ranging from 10% of the speed of light up to over 80%.
friction
from fast-moving gas clouds generates heat
, and the
disk becomes
so hot
—millions of degrees—that it
shines brightly.
Some of the material
in the disk is
also funnelled away
from the black hole
in a highly luminous, magnetically collimated jet.
The hot accretion disk and the jet combine to make the nucleus of the active galaxy shine so brightly that it can be seen far across the universe.
brightest quasars
outshine all of the stars in the galaxies
in which they reside, which
makes them visible
even at
distances of billions of light-years away.

**********Advancing Equity, From COVID-19 to Mpox
Context
Less than five years after the COVID-19 pandemic,
the world is again confronting a significant global health threat with the outbreak of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox).
This
crisis has already escalated into an international emergency, prompting declarations from both the World Health Organisation (WHO)
and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (AfricaCDC).
Therefore,
it becomes imperative to explore the implications of the mpox outbreak, emphasizing the importance of an equitable and coordinated global response
, and the lessons that must be applied from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Emergence of Mpox as a Global Health Crisis
Mpox has
rapidly transitioned from a regional concern
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
to a global health emergency.
WHO’s declaration of mpox as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is particularly significant,
as it follows the recent amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), which now include equity as a core principle.
Although these amendments will not be implemented until 2025,
the global response to mpox must prioritise equity from the outset.
principle is crucial in ensuring that all nations, particularly those in the Global South, receive the necessary support
and resources to combat the outbreak.
declaration of a PHEIC is intended to create international cooperation
and the rapid mobilisation of resources.
global community’s reaction to this declaration will set the tone for how future public health emergencies are managed,
especially considering the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic on Vaccine Equity and Manufacturing
The Inequities of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution
During the COVID-19 pandemic,
high-income countries swiftly moved to secure large quantities of vaccine doses,
often through advance purchase agreements with pharmaceutical companies.
This approach
, while ensuring rapid access for their populations,
resulted in vaccine hoarding and limited availability for lower-income countries.
Despite global initiatives like COVAX
, which aimed to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines,
the distribution remained heavily skewed in favour of wealthier nations.
By mid-2021,
many high-income countries had vaccinated a significant portion of their populations,
while many low-income countries had barely begun their vaccination campaigns.
inequity was exacerbated by the lack of local vaccine manufacturing capabilities
in the Global South.
Countries without the infrastructure
or expertise to produce vaccines
were entirely dependent on external supplies,
which were often delayed or insufficient.
dependency highlighted the vulnerability of these nations
during global health crises and the need for a more resilient and self-sufficient approach to vaccine production.
Lessons on Technology Transfer in Addressing Inequities
critical lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic is the importance of technology transfer
in ensuring equitable vaccine distribution.
Technology transfer involves sharing the knowledge, expertise, and patents
necessary for the local production of vaccines.
process is crucial for empowering lower-income countries
to produce vaccines independently, reducing their reliance on external sources, and enhancing their ability to respond to public health emergencies.
However,
during the COVID-19 pandemic, technology transfer was limited
, with many pharmaceutical companies and high-income countries reluctant to share intellectual property and manufacturing know-how.
This reluctance stemmed from concerns about protecting commercial interests
and maintaining control over production quality.
result was a significant delay in the ability of lower-income countries to produce vaccines locally,
contributing to prolonged inequities in vaccine access.
The Case of Oxford/AstraZeneca and India’s Role
The case of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine,
marketed as
Covishield
in India,
provides a notable exception.
Serum Institute of India (SII),
the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer,
was granted the rights to produce Covishield under a licensing agreement.
allowed for the mass production and distribution of the vaccine
, not only within India but also to many other low- and middle-income countries.
partnership demonstrated the potential of technology transfer to bridge the gap in vaccine access,
albeit within the constraints of the existing global intellectual property regime.
Mpox and the Opportunity for a Different Approach
As the world grapples with the mpox outbreak,
the availability of an existing vaccine, MVA-BN (Jynneos), presents an opportunity to apply the lessons learned from COVID-19.
Unlike the COVID-19 situation, where vaccines had to be developed from scratch, the MVA-BN vaccine is already approved and in production.
This gives the global community a HeadStart in combating the outbreak
, provided that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.
Challenges and Possible Solutions
challenge now is to ensure that the MVA-BN vaccine is not only produced in sufficient quantities but also distributed equitably.
To achieve this,
it is crucial to prioritise technology transfer to countries that have the capacity to produce vaccines
but lack the necessary expertise or resources.
India, with its robust pharmaceutical industry and experience in vaccine production, is a key player in this effort.
Indian manufacturers,
such as SII, Bharat Biotech, and Zydus Cadila,
have the infrastructure and expertise to scale up production of the MVA-BN vaccine, provided they receive the necessary technological support.
Way Forward
Expansion of Vaccine Manufacturing in the Global South
One of the most significant steps that can be taken to address vaccine inequities is the
expansion of manufacturing capabilities in the Global South.
The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that
reliance on a few manufacturers in high-income countries creates bottlenecks and delays in vaccine distribution
, particularly when global demand surges.
By diversifying manufacturing across multiple regions, the global community can ensure a more resilient supply chain
that can better withstand the pressures of a public health emergency.
Investment in Infrastructure and Capacity Building
For the mpox vaccine,
investing in the infrastructure and capacity of manufacturers in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is very important.
These
investments should not only focus on the physical infrastructure but also on training and capacity-building initiatives
to ensure that local manufacturers can meet international standards.
By empowering LMICs to produce vaccines, the global community can create a more equitable and self-sufficient health system
, reducing the disparities that have characterized previous pandemic responses.
A Better Understanding of Both; The Economic and Ethical Imperatives of Vaccine Equity
Beyond the practical benefits,
there is a strong ethical imperative to ensure vaccine equity.
The COVID-19 pandemic showed that
vaccine inequity is not just a moral failure but also a strategic mistake.
Ensuring equitable access
to the mpox vaccine is therefore not just a matter of fairness but
also a crucial component of global health security.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic provided a harsh lesson
in the consequences of vaccine inequity
and the limitations of a global health system that prioritises the interests of high-income countries.
As the world faces the mpox outbreak,
there is an urgent need to apply these lessons and take a different approach.
mpox outbreak presents an opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past and create a model for future public health responses
that is grounded in equity and solidarity.

Editorial Analysis
**********SC grants bail to BRS leader K Kavitha in Delhi excise policy case
Why in news?
The Supreme Court granted bail to Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha in the graft and money laundering cases related to the Delhi excise policy scam. The court emphasized that Kavitha's custody is no longer necessary as the investigation is complete.
The court referred to its earlier decision in the case of Manish Sisodia, asserting that undertrial custody should not be punitive. It highlighted Section 45(1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which allows special consideration for women in granting bail.
What’s in today’s article?
Section 45 of the PMLA
Key highlights of the judgement
About
Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) speaks about the conditions set for bail.
It states that no accused person shall be granted bail unless:
the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release; and
where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the Court is satisfied that:
there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and
that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.
Basically, this section prescribes a rather high bar for granting bail.
The negative language in the provision itself shows that bail is not the rule but the exception under PMLA
Twin test of bail under Section 45 of PMLA
The twin conditions of bail under Section 45 of the PMLA pose stringent thresholds for an accused.
For one, the person has to prove in court that he or she is prima facie innocent of the offence.
Secondly, the accused should be able to convince the judge he would not commit any offence while on bail.
The burden of proof is entirely on the incarcerated accused, who would be often handicapped to fight the might of the state.
The twin conditions make it almost impossible for an accused to get bail under the PMLA.
Before the 2019 amendments of PMLA
, if someone was accused of a crime related to money laundering,
the law automatically assumed they were guilty of the original crime
(called the "scheduled offence").
The accused had to prove they were not involved in that crime to get bail.
Exceptions
There is an important exception allowing bail for individuals who are women, minors (under 16), or those who are sick or infirm, if the Special Court permits.
This exception is akin to provisions in the Indian Penal Code that provide special consideration for women and minors.
Legal precedent for such exceptions
In 2023, the Delhi High Court granted bail to Preeti Chandra, wife of Sanjay Chandra, under the exception for women in Section 45(1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) argued that she was not a household lady.
However, the court rejected this distinction, stating that neither the PMLA nor the Constitution differentiates between types of women, whether they are household women, businesswomen, or political figures.
The court criticized the attempt to create sub-classifications within the broader category of "woman," deeming it misconceived.
the court also specified that to be eligible for bail, the accused must not be a flight risk or likely to tamper with witnesses
Background of the case
The CBI, in its chargesheet, alleged that BRS MLC K Kavitha "demanded, collected, and provided" Rs 100 crore to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to influence the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy.
The ED claimed Kavitha was part of a "South Group" that received undue favors and stakes in wholesale businesses and retail zones from AAP leaders in exchange for the money.
The alleged bribes were reportedly used to fund AAP’s 2022 Goa Assembly election campaign.
The ED named Kavitha as an accused in its sixth supplementary chargesheet.
Bail Justification
The court stated that since the investigation is complete and the chargesheet has been filed, Kavitha's custody is no longer necessary.
She has been in jail for five months, and the trial is unlikely to conclude soon.
The court emphasized that undertrial custody should not become a form of punishment.
Criticism of the Delhi High Court's Ruling
The court criticized a Delhi High Court ruling that
denied bail to an educated, sophisticated woman under the PMLA's beneficiary provision for women
It warned that if such reasoning became law, it would mean no educated woman could get bail, affecting courts in Delhi's jurisdiction.
The court rejected the idea of creating distinctions between an MP and a common person, stating that the High Court's reasoning introduced an artificial discretion not present in the statute.

**********Telegram CEO arrested in Paris
Why in news?
Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, was arrested in Paris recently on charges related to the alleged use of his messaging platform for illicit activities, including drug trafficking and the distribution of child sexual abuse material.
What’s in today’s article?
France’s case against Telegram and Durov
Response of the event
Founded by
Telegram was founded in 2013 by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai.
Before creating Telegram, Durov founded VKontakte, Russia's largest social network, but sold his stake and left Russia in 2014 after facing pressure from the Russian government to censor and hand over data on opposition activists.
Telegram is now based in Dubai, which Durov considers a neutral location that supports the platform's commitment to user privacy and freedom of speech.
About
Telegram is a messaging app that allows for one-on-one conversations, group chats, and large channels for broadcasting messages.
Unlike WhatsApp, which limits group chats to 1,024 participants, Telegram allows up to 200,000 people in a group, raising concerns about the spread of misinformation.
While Telegram offers end-to-end encryption, this feature is not enabled by default and does not apply to group chats, unlike competitors like Signal and Facebook Messenger, which encrypt chats by default.
Only Telegram's "secret chat" feature provides end-to-end encryption. With over 950 million active users, Telegram is widely used in France, including by government officials.
However, it has also been utilized by extremists and drug traffickers.
Pavel Durov was arrested at Le Bourget airport in connection with accusations against Telegram for
complicity in drug trafficking, terrorism support, and cyberstalking
Telegram’s strong privacy features have enabled some users to conduct illegal activities, such as selling drugs and committing online scams.
An investigation was launched after 12 alleged violations, with Durov reportedly refusing to cooperate, leading to an arrest warrant.
Security agencies had quietly begun investigating Telegram for the dissemination of child pornography, with additional charges added later.
Telegram's policy is to take down illegal content but resists politically motivated censorship.
Durov's Arrest and Russian-Western Relations
Pavel Durov’s arrest has strained relations between Russia and the West.
Russian officials, including the Kremlin, have condemned the detention as politically motivated and a double standard on freedom of speech.
The Russian Embassy in Paris reported that consular access to Durov was denied.
Tension Between Governments and Tech Companies
Durov’s arrest highlights ongoing
conflicts between governments and tech companies over balancing free speech with regulating illegal activities
Critics, including Edward Snowden, have condemned the French government for perceived overreach, calling the arrest an attack on basic human rights.
Durov’s Neutrality Stance
Durov has consistently advocated for Telegram to remain a neutral platform, resisting pressure from governments to engage in geopolitics.
He has highlighted the platform's commitment to privacy and free speech.
Parallels with Other Tech Giants
The situation with Telegram mirrors actions against other tech companies like Meta and X (formerly Twitter).
Governments have increasingly clashed with these platforms over the regulation of harmful content.
Notably, in Brazil, X shut down operations after refusing to comply with a Supreme Court order, citing transparency and free speech concerns.
In India, WhatsApp faced pressure to address fake news but refused to compromise user privacy by revealing message sources.

**********Over 3 crore PM Jan Dhan accounts to be opened in FY25
Why in the News?
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government aims to open more than 3 crore accounts under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). Wednesday marks the 10th anniversary of the scheme.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About PMJDY (Objectives, Key Features, Achievements, Challenges, etc.)
News Summary
About Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana:
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is a flagship financial inclusion initiative launched by the Government of India on August 28, 2014.
The scheme aims to provide affordable access to financial services such as banking, savings and deposit accounts, remittances, credit, insurance, and pension to the unbanked population in the country.
It is one of the largest financial inclusion initiatives in the world, designed to promote inclusive growth by ensuring that every household has access to essential financial services.
Objectives of the Scheme:
Financial Inclusion:
The primary objective of PMJDY is to ensure that every household in India has at least one bank account, thereby bringing the unbanked sections of society into the formal financial system.
Access to Financial Services:
The scheme aims to provide access to a wide range of financial services, including basic savings accounts, access to need-based credit, remittances, insurance, and pension.
Key Features of the Scheme:
Zero Balance Accounts:
Under PMJDY, beneficiaries can open a basic savings bank account without any requirement of maintaining a minimum balance. However, if the account-holder wishes to get a cheque book, they need to fulfil the minimum balance criteria.
RuPay Debit Card:
Each account holder under the scheme is provided with a RuPay debit card, which can be used for cash withdrawals, making payments, and purchasing goods and services. The
RuPay card also comes with an in-built accident insurance cover of Rs. 1 lakh
(which has been increased to Rs. 2 lakh for accounts opened after August, 2018).
Overdraft Facility:
PMJDY accounts are
eligible for an overdraft facility of up to Rs. 10,000 after six months of satisfactory operation
. This facility acts as a credit line for account holders, helping them meet urgent financial needs.
Life Insurance Cover:
Account holders under PMJDY are also
eligible for a life insurance cover of Rs. 30,000
, provided they open the account before a specified date and meet other eligibility criteria.
Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT):
PMJDY accounts are linked to the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, enabling beneficiaries to receive government subsidies, pensions, scholarships, and other payments directly into their bank accounts.
Mobile Banking Facility:
The scheme also offers basic mobile banking facilities to account holders, enabling them to check their account balance, transfer funds, and perform other banking transactions using their mobile phones.
Impact & Achievements:
As of 2024,
more than 53 crore active PMJDY accounts exist with a total deposit balance of ₹2.3 lakh crore
. The scheme has significantly contributed to the financial inclusion of millions of unbanked households.
Women Empowerment:
55% of PMJDY account holders are women
, promoting gender equality and empowering women by providing them with access to financial services.
Rural Penetration:
Approximately
67% of the accounts opened under PMJDY are in rural and semi-urban areas
, ensuring that financial services reach the remote and underserved regions of the country.
Major Challenges:
Dormant Accounts:
A significant number of Jan Dhan accounts remain inactive or have very low balances.
Many account holders, particularly in rural areas, do not actively use their accounts due to a lack of awareness, financial literacy, or limited access to banking services
This dormancy reduces the effectiveness of the scheme, as the financial inclusion goal is not fully achieved if accounts are not being utilized for transactions, savings, or other financial activities.
Limited Financial Literacy:
A considerable portion of the population, especially in rural areas, lacks basic financial literacy. This includes understanding the benefits of having a bank account, using digital banking services, or managing personal finances.
lack of financial literacy leads to underutilization of the services offered under PMJDY, such as overdraft facilities, insurance, and pension schemes
Infrastructure Challenges:
In many remote and rural areas, there is
limited access to banking infrastructure, such as bank branches, ATMs, or banking correspondents
. This makes it difficult for account holders to access banking services, deposit or withdraw money, or seek assistance.
Connectivity issues, especially in rural regions, also affect the functioning of mobile banking services and digital transactions, limiting the reach of the scheme.
Operational Burden on Banks:
The large-scale opening of Jan Dhan accounts has put an
additional operational burden on banks, particularly public sector banks, which often struggle with limited resources and staff
Managing a high volume of low-balance accounts increases the cost for banks, as they have to maintain these accounts and provide services with minimal financial returns.
News Summary:
On the 10th anniversary of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the government's goal to open over 3 crore new accounts, aiming to cover the entire adult population.
RuPay debit cards, which include a ₹2 lakh accident insurance cover, have been issued to 36.14 crore account holders.
PMJDY has played a crucial role in providing financial support through various government schemes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 56% of the accounts belonging to women.
The scheme has made significant strides in financial inclusion, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas, with 66.6% of accounts opened in these regions.
The Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity has propelled India's financial inclusion rate to 80% of adults, a remarkable achievement in just six years.
Additionally, India's digital infrastructure has enabled government-to-person (G2P) transfers totalling $361 billion, benefiting millions of citizens across the country.

data reveals that food inflation, particularly from pulses, vegetables, and cereals, is rising faster than the overall CPI inflation.
is the index used to calculate
headline inflation
in India. It is calculated and published monthly by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics
Key Highlights of the CPI-C Data:
On Current Inflation Rates:
general
CPI inflation stands at 3.54%,
while food inflation is
notably higher at 5.06%,
driven by increases in prices of pulses, vegetables, and cereals.
On Inflation Dynamics in the Past:
Over the past decade, food inflation has contributed to the overall volatility of prices. In
52 of the 124 months
analyzed,
food inflation exceeded the general CPI
rate,
indicating a significant and fluctuating impact on overall inflation.
Expectations by the report:
The RBI has highlighted that
food inflation significantly influences inflationary expectations,
which remain unanchored, often exceeding actual inflation rates.
(*Note: These data don’t include income taxes or investment items like stocks, bonds, and life insurance.)
Recently impact of good Monsoon on Food Production and Inflation:
Increased Sowing Due to Robust Monsoon:
India has reported a significant increase in the sowing of paddy and pulses, with paddy sowing up by
16% to 39 million hectares and pulses by 7% to 12 million hectares as of August 23, 2024,
driven by a strong monsoon.
Potential Impact on Food Inflation:
Despite concerns over rising food inflation, the expanded
cultivation area for staple crops like rice and pulses could positively impact the agriculture sector
and support government efforts to enhance farm productivity.
Present Situation of Inflation in the Agri-Food Sector
Volatility in Food Prices:
Food inflation has been volatile, with instances of both high and low inflation. For example, food inflation was
above 6% in 52 out of 124 months
, while it was
below 2% in 20 months,
including periods of negative inflation.
Supply-Side Factors:
The disparities between
food and retail inflation
can be attributed to supply-side issues such as
monsoon variability, crop failures, and government policies
minimum support prices (MSPs).
Excess demand for specific food categories, such as
oils and fats,
has also contributed to higher inflation.
Regional Disparities:
Rural CPI
higher (5.43%)
compared to
urban CPI (4.11%)
, reflecting the impact of agricultural conditions and market dynamics on rural households.
How Can the Gap Between Farmer and Consumer Be Reduced?
Market-Driven Pricing:
The government should reconsider its
intervention in agricultural markets through MSPs
, allowing market forces to determine food prices. This could help reduce production distortions and improve price signals for farmers.
Enhancing Agricultural Productivity:
Government expenditure
should focus on increasing agricultural productivity
better technology and irrigation practices
, which can lead to more stable food supplies and prices.
Reducing Middlemen:
Implementing measures to
eliminate middlemen in the supply chain can help narrow the gap
between what farmers receive and what consumers pay.
Infrastructure Development:
Improving infrastructure for
storage and transportation
can help reduce food wastage and ensure that food products reach consumers efficiently, further stabilizing prices.
Conclusion:
Need to
encourage the adoption of advanced agricultural technologies and sustainable farming
practices to boost productivity and reduce the impact of supply-side disruptions, ensuring more consistent food supplies and stable prices.
Mains PYQ:
Do you agree with the view that steady GDP growth and low inflation have left the Indian economy in good shape? Give reasons in support of your arguments.

**********Advancing equity, from COVID-19 to Mpox  
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About Monkeypox;
Mains level:
Major Learnings from the COVID-19 Pandemic;
Why in the News?
The recent declaration of
(formerly monkeypox) as a
Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)
by the
WHO
highlights several critical lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Vaccine Manufacturing Capabilities:
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed
significant gaps in vaccine manufacturing capabilities
, particularly in the
Global South.
This inadequacy was exacerbated by
limited technology transfers
and a
lack of know-how to produce vaccines
developed in high-income countries.
The current response to the
Mpox outbreak reflects similar challenges,
emphasizing the need for robust local manufacturing capabilities to ensure equitable access to vaccines.
Global Cooperation:
The pandemic underscored the
necessity of international collaboration
in health emergencies. The WHO’s declaration of
Mpox as a PHEIC aims to foster this cooperation
, encouraging countries and organizations to share information and resources to combat the outbreak.
Equity in Health Responses:
The recent amendments to the
International Health Regulations (IHR) include equity as a core principle
, which is crucial for ensuring that all countries, particularly those in lower-middle-income regions, have access to essential medical products during emergencies.
Recent Initiatives by India’s Drug Regulatory Agency:
On August 7, 2024, India’s
Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO)
decided that
drugs already approved in developed countries
like the U.S. and those in the EU
can be used during pandemics
in India
without needing to go through clinical trials
here.
This regulatory change is expected to
expedite the availability of critical vaccines like MVA-BN (Jynneos)
in India, facilitating faster access to vaccines necessary to combat the Mpox outbreak.
What could be the more improved solution for it?
Scaling Up Production:
The demand for pox vaccines is anticipated to surge, with estimates by
AfricaCDC
, suggesting that
10 million doses are needed to control the outbreak.
However, only 0.21 million doses are currently available.
Indian manufacturers, such as the
Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech,
have the potential to rapidly scale up production of the
MVA-BN vaccine
using established processes and supply chains.
Comprehensive Technology Transfer:
Effective technology transfer involves
sharing not only the vaccine but also the necessary biological resources, manufacturing know-how, and patents.
This is essential to
enable lower-middle-income countries to produce vaccines independently,
reducing reliance on high-income countries.
Collaborative Negotiations:
The Indian government, in collaboration with
international organizations like WHO and Gavi,
should negotiate with
Bavarian Nordic for technology transfer
to technology transfer for developing the vaccine.
Way forward:
Strengthen Local Manufacturing:
Encourage Indian manufacturers like the
, ensuring timely and sufficient supply to meet both domestic and global demand during the mpox outbreak.
Facilitate Technology Transfer:
The Indian government should lead
collaborative efforts with international organizations to secure comprehensive technology transfers
, enabling domestic production of vaccines and reducing dependency on high-income countries.
Mains PYQ:
COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented devastation worldwide. However, technological advancements are being availed readily to win over the crisis. Give an account of how technology was sought to aid the management of the pandemic.

A recent study published in
journal IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing
has found that
Chile’s Atacama salt flat (Salar de Atacama)
is sinking at a
rate of 1 to 2 centimetres per year
lithium brine extraction.
Lithium brine extraction involves
pumping salt-rich water to the surface and letting it evaporate in ponds to collect lithium.
About Salar de Atacama
The
in Chile boasts the
highest lithium concentration
(0.15% by weight) among all brine sources worldwide.
Argentina boasts
more than half
