India’s Changing Position on Climate Change
Why in News?
The government of India articulated a radically different position on climate change (at a time when it is becoming increasingly clear that the 1.5℃ target would be missed) in the Economic Survey (ES) 2023-24 presented in the Parliament.
The ES has also observed that the proposed Carbon Border Adjustment Tax (CBAT) of the European Union (EU) is in violation of the spirit of the Paris Agreement and reiterates the Central government's concern on protectionism.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Global Temperature Target?
Why is India Challenging Global Climate Change Discourse?
Suggestions in the Economic Survey for the Climate Problem
What is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)?
Why India Criticises CBAM?
According to the 2015 Paris Agreement
, countries must make efforts to ensure that the rise in global average annual temperature is contained -
Within 2℃ from the pre-industrial times (average of 1850-1900 period), and
Preferably within 1.5℃.
Every country has to prepare and implement an action plan that contributes towards meeting this target.
Inequity of the global climate change architecture:
India has consistently criticised the inequity of the global climate change architecture and the indifference of developed countries in their climate efforts.
A single global temperature (1.5 or 2℃ thresholds) target:
The global temperature target fails to reflect the intricate connections between climate, ecological integrity, and human well-being.
Alternate energy solutions had their own set of problems
: For example, critical minerals (required for batteries) were being mined in the most underdeveloped parts of the world, adversely affecting regional ecological health.
Suggestions in the Economic Survey for the Climate Problem:
A more sustainable approach
to addressing the climate problem would involve changing lifestyle choices and minimising waste and overconsumption rather than switching to an alternate energy source.
A more balanced approach
suggests that the best insurance against climate change is to implement shorter-term policies aimed at improving people's quality of life.
These are tariffs
that will apply on energy-intensive goods imported into the EU.
Its goal is to ensure that
Local producers of iron, steel, and aluminium (which use a significant amount of fossil fuel) do not face a competitive disadvantage when compared to
Producers of similar goods made in developing nations whose industries have more lenient emission standards for fossil fuels.
The CBAM system is expected to come into force on January 1, 2026.
CBAM is in contravention to the Paris Agreement:
These taxes are in contravention to the spirit of the Paris Agreement that recognised Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR).
India is adversely affected by CBAM:
In 2022, 27% of India’s exports of iron, steel and aluminium products worth $8.2 billion went to the EU.
To achieve net zero by 2070, India needs $28 billion annually until that year.
India’s climate action has been largely financed through domestic resources and the flow of international finance has been very limited.
Hence, CBAM will affect India’s financial resources for climate change adaptation.

**********Govt Servants and RSS Activities: What Rules Say
Why in the News?
Following a directive from the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) earlier this month, employees can now engage in activities of the RSS without facing disciplinary action under the applicable conduct rules.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About DoPT’s Circular (Purpose, Historical Context, Existing Rules, Impact, etc.)
Removal of Restrictions on RSS Activities for Government Employees:
The Centre has decided to remove the prohibition on government officials participating in activities of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
This restriction has been in place for almost six decades.
Following a directive issued by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) earlier this month,
employees can now engage in RSS activities without facing disciplinary action under the applicable conduct rules
: The directive reviewed and removed mentions of the RSS from Official Memorandums dated November 30, 1966, July 25, 1970, and October 28, 1980.
Historical Context:
Previous Circulars:
1966 Circular
: Issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, it prohibited government servants from participating in RSS and Jamaat-e-Islami activities, citing Rule 5 of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964.
1970 Circular
: Reiterated the 1966 directive and stressed disciplinary action against violators.
1980 Circular
: Emphasized the need for secularism among government servants and reiterated previous orders against communal organizations.
The RSS has always maintained that it is a non-political, cultural organization, unaffected by such restrictions.
Rule 5 of Conduct Rules:
: Prohibits government servants from associating with political parties or organizations involved in politics.
All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968
: Similar to the 1964 Rules, applicable to IAS, IPS, and Indian Forest Service officers.
Prior:
Before the 1964 and 1968 Rules, the Government Servants' Conduct Rules, 1949, prohibited political activities by government employees.
Violations and Consequences:
Violations of Rule 5 could lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal.
Determining political nature or association with the RSS was challenging due to its informal membership system.
Implications of the DoPT’s Circular:
The new directive implies that the RSS is not considered a political organization, allowing government employees to participate in its activities without violating conduct rules.
However, the
remains classified as a political organization.
Applicability to State Government Employees:
Recent circular applies only to central government employees.
State governments have their own conduct rules, and their stance on RSS participation varies.
Conclusion:
The removal of the restriction on participating in RSS activities marks a significant change in the government's approach to its conduct rules, reflecting a shift in policy after several decades.

Climate Change and India: Why We Must Look at the Problem Through Our Lens
Current global strategies for climate change are flawed and not universally applicable.
The Western approach does not seek to address the root of the problem, i.e. overconsumption, but rather chooses to substitute the means to achieve overconsumption.
A one-size-fits-all approach will not work, and developing countries need to be free to choose their own pathways.

What’s in today’s article?
Key highlights of Economic Survey 2023-24
About
The Economic Survey of India is an annual report released by the Finance Ministry. It details the state of the economic performance of the country in the past year.

The first Economic Survey was presented for 1950-51 and until 1964, it was presented along with the Budget.
Significance
Even though it comes just a day before the Budget, the assessment and recommendations carried out in the survey are not binding on the Budget.
However, the survey remains the most authoritative and comprehensive analysis of the economy that is conducted from within the Union government.
Key highlights from Economic Survey 2023-24
India’s economy – steady as she goes

Gross value added (GVA)
grew by 7.2 per cent in FY24 (at 2011-12 prices) and net taxes at constant prices grew by 19.1 per cent in FY24.
retail inflation
reduced from 6.7 per cent in FY23 to 5.4 per cent in FY24.
Current Account Deficit (CAD)
stood at 0.7 per cent of the GDP during FY24, an improvement from the deficit of 2.0 per cent of GDP in FY23.
55% of tax collected accrued from direct taxes and remaining 45% from indirect taxes
Government has been able to ensure free food grains to 81.4 Crore people. Total expenditure allotted to capital spending have progressively enhanced.
Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation- Stability is the Watchword
Credit disbursal by Scheduled Commercial Banks
(SCBs) stood at ₹164.3 lakh crore, growing by 20.2 per cent at the end of March 2024.
Agriculture and allied activities
witnessed double digits growth in credit during FY24.
Industrial credit growth
was 8.5 per cent compared to 5.2 per cent a year ago.
Primary capital markets facilitated
capital formation
of ₹10.9 lakh crore during FY24 (approximately 29 per cent of the gross fixed capital formation of private and public corporates during FY23).
Financial inclusion
is not just a goal but also an enabler for sustainable economic growth, reduction of inequality and elimination of poverty.
The next big challenge is Digital Financial Inclusion (DFI)
India poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade.
Indian microfinance sector emerges as the second largest in the world after China
Prices and Inflation- Under Control
The survey highlights that the inflation rate was stable, reflecting effective monetary policy management.
Central Government announced price cuts for LPG, petrol, and diesel. As a result, retail fuel inflation stayed low in FY24.
In August 2023, the price of domestic LPG cylinders was reduced by ₹200 per cylinder across all markets in India. Since then, LPG inflation has been in the deflationary zone.
Core services inflation eased to a nine-year low in FY24; at the same time, core goods inflation also declined to a four-year low.
In FY24, core consumer durables inflation declined due to an improved supply of key input materials to industries.
Agriculture sector faced challenges due to extreme weather events, depleted reservoirs, and crop damage, which impacted farm output and food prices.
Food inflation stood at 6.6 per cent in FY23 and increased to 7.5 per cent in FY24.
Government took appropriate administrative actions, including dynamic stock management, open market operations, subsidised provision of essential food items and trade policy measures, which helping to mitigate food inflation.
The survey emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to manage food prices effectively.
It makes a case for changing the inflation targeting framework of the central bank by excluding food inflation.
External Sector - Stability Amid Plenty
India’s external sector remained strong amidst on-going geopolitical headwinds accompanied by sticky inflation.
India’s rank in the
World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index
improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to
38th in 2023
, out of 139 countries.
The moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports have improved India’s current account deficit which narrowed 0.7 per cent in FY24.
India is gaining market share in global exports of goods and services.
Its share in global goods exports was
8 per cent in FY24
, against an average of 1.7 per cent during FY16-FY20.
India’s services exports grew by 4.9 per cent to USD 341.1 billion in FY24, with growth largely driven by IT/software services and ‘other’ business services.
India is the top remittance recipient country globally
, with remittances reaching a milestone of USD 120 billion in 2023.
India’s external debt
has been sustainable over the years, with the external debt to GDP ratio standing at 18.7 per cent at the end of March 2024.
Medium-Term Outlook – A Growth Strategy for New India
Key areas of policy focus in the short to medium term:
job and skill creation,
tapping the full potential of the agriculture sector,
addressing MSME bottlenecks,
managing India’s green transition,
deftly dealing with the Chinese conundrum,
deepening the corporate bond market,
tackling inequality and improving our young population’s quality of health.
Amrit Kaal’s growth strategy based on six key areas:
boosting private investment,
expansion of MSMEs,
agriculture as growth engine,
financing green transition,
bridging education-employment gap, and
building capacity of States.
For Indian economy to grow at 7 per cent plus, a tripartite compact between the Union Government, State Governments and the private sector is required
