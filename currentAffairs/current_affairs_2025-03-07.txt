Syllabus:
Prelims – GS 2
Context:
The Vice-President of India, Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar, called for a national debate on the shift from democracy to Emocracy, saying, “National debate is required so that we take note of shift from Democracy to Emocracy. Emotion-driven policies, emotion-driven debates, discourses threaten good governance.”
Background: –
“Historically, populism is bad economics. And once a leader gets attached to populism it is difficult to get out of the crisis. The central factor must be the good of the people, the largest good of the people, the lasting good of the people”, V P said.

REAL ESTATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY (RERA)
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
The Supreme Court criticised the functioning of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) and termed it as “disappointing”.
This isn’t the first time the court has criticised RERA’s performance. In September 2024, the Supreme Court described RERA as a “rehabilitation centre for former bureaucrats,” accusing it of undermining the Act’s purpose.
The Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) was established under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 to regulate and promote transparency in the real estate sector.
RERA is applicable to residential and commercial real estate projects, including plotted developments.
Objectives of RERA
Regulate the real estate sector and improve accountability.
Ensure timely completion of projects and prevent delays.
Promote transparency in property transactions.
Protect buyers’ rights by setting grievance redressal mechanisms.
Encourage investment by creating a reliable framework.
Key Provisions of the RERA Act, 2016
Establishment of RERA
States and Union Territories must establish a Real Estate Regulatory Authority for grievance redressal.
Functions include project registration, dispute resolution, and policy implementation.
Mandatory Project Registration : Developers must register real estate projects (above 500 sq. m. or 8 apartments) before advertising or selling. Projects without RERA registration are illegal.
Escrow Account Requirement : Builders must deposit 70% of funds collected from buyers into a separate escrow account to ensure funds are used for the same project.
Timely Completion & Compensation : Developers must complete projects on time, failing which they face penalties or compensation liabilities.
Consumer Protection & Rights
Buyers have the right to full project details, possession timeline, and compensation for delays.
False advertising by developers can lead to refunds or penalties.
Establishment of Real Estate Appellate Tribunal : If dissatisfied with RERA decisions, consumers can approach the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal.

CAPITAL ACCOUNT CONVERTIBILITY
Mains – ECONOMY
India should not rush into full capital account convertibility at its current per capita income level of about $2,570, Arvind Panagariya, Chairman of the 16th Finance Commission, has said.
Instead, the country should consider this reform only when per capita income reaches $8,000-10,000, he suggested.
Capital Account Convertibility (CAC) refers to the freedom to convert local financial assets into foreign financial assets and vice versa at market-determined exchange rates.
It is part of the Balance of Payments (BoP), which consists of the current account (trade in goods and services) and the capital account (financial transactions).
Types of Convertibility:
Current Account Convertibility: Allows free exchange of currency for trade in goods and services.
Capital Account Convertibility: Allows free exchange of currency for financial transactions like investments, loans, and acquisitions.
Importance of Capital Account Convertibility:
Foreign Investment: CAC attracts foreign investment and capital inflows boosting economic growth.
Global Integration: It facilitates integration with global financial markets, enabling access to international capital.
Economic Efficiency: CAC promotes efficient allocation of resources by allowing capital to flow to its most productive uses.
Challenges and Risks of Capital Account Convertibility:
Volatility: Free capital flows can lead to exchange rate volatility and financial instability, as seen during the Asian Financial Crisis (1997).
Capital Flight: In times of economic uncertainty, investors may withdraw capital rapidly, leading to currency depreciation and economic instability.
Monetary Policy Constraints: CAC limits the ability of the central bank to control domestic interest rates and money supply, as it must consider global financial conditions.
Speculative Attacks: Countries with weak economic fundamentals may face speculative attacks on their currency, leading to crises.
India’s Approach to Capital Account Convertibility:
Tarapore Committee (1997):
The S.S. Tarapore Committee was set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to recommend a roadmap for CAC in India.
The committee suggested a three-phase approach with preconditions like fiscal consolidation, low inflation, and a strong financial system.
Partial Convertibility:
India has adopted a gradual and cautious approach to CAC, allowing partial convertibility with certain restrictions.
For example, while FDI and FPI are allowed, there are limits on the amount of capital that can be moved in and out of the country.
Current Status:
India has full current account convertibility but partial capital account convertibility.
The Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) allows individuals to remit up to $250,000 per year for permissible transactions.

**********Antarctic Circumpolar Current
A groundbreaking study has revealed that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)—the world’s most powerful ocean current—is slowing down due to melting ice sheets.
About Antarctic Circumpolar Current:
The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is the
strongest ocean current globally,
flowing clockwise (from west to east) around Antarctica and connecting the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.
As the only ocean current connecting the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, the ACC is five times stronger than the Gulf Stream and over 100 times more powerful than the Amazon River.
The Antarctic Circumpolar Current separates the Southern Ocean from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans at 60° S latitude, which roughly coincides with the current’s southern boundary.
It plays a
critical role in regulating Earth’s climate
by distributing heat, water, and nutrients worldwide. Beyond climate regulation, the ACC acts as a natural barrier, preventing non-native marine species from reaching Antarctica.
However, the rapid melting of Antarctic ice due to rising global temperatures is introducing large volumes of freshwater into the ocean, which can disrupt the ACC's flow.
Potential Impacts of ACC Slowdown:
Climate Regulation:
A slowdown of the ACC could lead to more extreme climate events and alter weather patterns globally.
Marine Ecosystems:
Changes in the ACC can disrupt nutrient distribution, affecting marine biodiversity and fisheries.
Carbon Sequestration:
The ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide may decrease, potentially accelerating global warming.

**********Who is a D-Voter?
Assam's opposition recently raised concerns over the plight of ‘D’ (Doubtful) voters in Assam, demanding the closure of the state’s only detention centre, now termed a transit camp, and the tabling of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) report in the Assembly.
About D-Voter:
D-voters or doubtful voters, are a category of voters in Assam who couldn't give evidence to prove their Indian nationality and whose cases are pending with the Foreigners Tribunals or who have been declared foreigners by the Tribunal.
The D-voter category was introduced by the Election Commission of India in 1997.
Because their Indian citizenship has not been verified, doubtful voters are not allowed to vote in elections.
They are also not permitted to run for office in the nation's elections.
However, ‘doubtful voter’ or ‘doubtful citizenship’ have not been defined in the Citizenship Act, 1955, or the Citizenship Rules of 2003.
The Citizenship Rules, 2003, was framed under the provisions of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003.
The rules framed in 2003 list out the steps to be followed for the preparation of the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC).
It has only been stated that the Local Registrar will include the details of individuals whose citizenship is in doubt with an "appropriate remark in the population register for further enquiry" under subsection 4 of section 4, which deals with the production of the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC).
A family or individual is notified in a specific pro forma as soon as the verification process concludes, whether they have been classified as a dubious citizen (D-Category).
Before deciding whether or not to add their name to the register, they are also given the opportunity to be heard by the Taluk or Sub-district Registrar of Citizenship.
The Registrar has ninety days to complete and justify his findings.
The marking as a doubtful voter is a temporary measure and cannot be prolonged. Within a specific timeframe, a decision needs to be made.
According to the documentation provided, if it is determined that the individual is a foreign national or an illegal immigrant, they may be deported or placed in a detention centre.
D-voters can also apply to have their names added to the NRC.
They will be included only after they get clearance from the Foreigners Tribunals and their names are removed from electoral rolls under the ‘D’ category.

**********What is Vitiligo?
New research shows gut-friendly bacteria may slow vitiligo progression, offering hope for millions with autoimmune disease.
About Vitiligo:
Vitiligo (vit-ih-LIE-go) is a disease that causes loss of skin color in patches.
The condition can affect the skin on any part of the body.
It generally starts on your hands, forearms, 0feet and face.
The discolored areas usually get bigger with time.
It can also affect hair and the inside of the mouth.
Causes:
The condition occurs when your body’s immune system destroys melanocytes.
Melanocytes are skin cells that produce melanin, the chemical that gives skin its color, or pigmentation.
While research is ongoing to learn more about the causes of vitiligo, studies indicate that about 30% of vitiligo cases are genetic.
Vitiligo affects all races and sexes equally. It’s more visible in people with darker skin tones.
Globally, about 1% of the population has vitiligo.
Treatment:
The condition is not life-threatening or contagious.
Treatment for vitiligo may restore color to the affected skin.
But it doesn't prevent continued loss of skin color or a recurrence.

**********Beyond ‘Beijing’, Unlocking a Feminist Future in India
Context
The
Beijing Declaration
and Platform for Action,
adopted in 1995,
remains one of the
most
comprehensive global blueprints for advancing women’s rights
.
It
laid out a road map for accelerating gender equality across 12 critical areas
of concern, including education, health, economic empowerment, and political participation.
Over the past three decades,
India has made significant strides in these dimensions,
driven by sustained policy efforts, grassroots activism, and the resilience of women and girls.
Now
it becomes imperative to examine India’s progress in gender equality, highlighting achievements in health, education, and economic empowerment
while acknowledging the persistent challenges of gender-based violence.
India’s Achievements in Advancing Women’s Rights
Health and Maternal Care: A Significant Leap Forward
One of India’s most notable achievements in advancing women’s rights has been in the
field of healthcare, particularly maternal and reproductive health.
Government initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan and
Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
have significantly improved maternal health care,
leading to an increase in institutional deliveries to 95%.
Furthermore,
maternal mortality has decreased from 130 to 97 deaths per 100,000 births between 2014 and 2020,
demonstrating progress in ensuring safer childbirth.
Expansion of Reproductive health services
The expansion of reproductive health services has
given women greater autonomy
over their bodies.
Over half of married women (56.5%) now use modern contraceptives
, empowering them with greater control over family planning.
Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana
, the world’s largest government-funded healthcare program,
has provided millions of women with access to critical medical treatment,
further strengthening India’s commitment to women’s well-being.
Education and Empowerment: A Path to Inclusion
Education has been at the heart of India’s gender equality agenda.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP)
initiative has played a crucial role in improving the child sex ratio and increasing school enrolments for girls.
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
has introduced reforms aimed at increasing retention rates and expanding opportunities for women in fields such as Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).
However,
safety concerns in higher secondary education persist,
necessitating further efforts to create a secure learning environment for girls.
Economic Empowerment of Women: Bridging the Digital Divide
Economic independence is central to gender equality,
and India has made remarkable progress in this area.
Through initiatives like the
National Rural and Urban Livelihood Missions
nearly 100 million women have been integrated into financial network
s via self-help groups, creating entrepreneurship and financial autonomy.
The expansion of digital financial services
, particularly through the
Unified Payments Interface (UPI), has enabled more women to participate in the digital economy.
Moreover, the
Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana–National Rural Livelihood Mission has facilitated access to credit, financial literacy programs
, and entrepreneurship opportunities for millions of rural women.
In addition,
the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan has trained over 35 million rural women in digital literacy
, ensuring their inclusion in the evolving digital landscape.
Gender-Responsive Budgeting
Recognising the importance of financial investment in women’s empowerment,
India has embraced gender-responsive budgeting.
share of the Gender Budget
in the total national budget has
increased from 6.8% in 2024-25 to 8.8% in 2025-26, with $55.2 billion
allocated toward gender-specific programs.
These financial commitments
highlight India’s dedication to sustaining and expanding its progress toward gender equality.
Women in Leadership: A Catalyst for Change
active participation of women in leadership roles has been instrumental
in driving India’s progress on gender equality.
Young women are emerging as leaders in climate action,
digital entrepreneurship, and governance.
Initiatives
like the Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions
(GATI) Project,
which supports women in STEM, and the
G20 TechEquity Platform
, which has trained thousands of young women in emerging technologies, reflect this transformation.
Political Representation
Political representation has also seen a boost.
Women’s Reservation Bill, which guarantees 33% representation for women in legislatures
, builds on the success of local governance initiatives that have empowered 1.5 million women leaders, creating the world’s largest cohort of women in political leadership.
Persistent Challenges in Addressing Gender-Based Violence
Despite progress in many areas,
gender-based violence remains a pressing issue.
Beijing Declaration emphasised the need to eliminate violence
against women, yet many continue to face abuse and discrimination.
In response,
India has established 770 One Stop Centres,
providing medical, legal, and psychological support to survivors of violence.
Legal reforms have also strengthened protections for women.
The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023, implemented in July 2024,
enhances legal frameworks for women’s safety and justice.
Innovations such as
Odisha’s blockchain-based system have expedited support services
for survivors, ensuring confidentiality and efficiency in assistance.
Additionally,
partnerships between the United Nations Population Fund and institutions like the Rajasthan Police Academy
have enhanced gender-responsive policing, improving trust in law enforcement and increasing access to justice.
While these measures represent progress, further efforts are needed
to eliminate gender-based violence completely.
A Roadmap for the Future
As India marks the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration,
it reaffirms its commitment to gender equality as a national and global priority.
While significant progress has been made in health, education, and economic empowerment,
challenges such as gender-based violence and workplace discrimination persist.
Strengthening collaborations,
investing in young women’s leadership, and addressing systemic barriers will be crucial in accelerating progress.
Conclusion:
The Beijing Platform for Action continues to serve as a guiding framework
for India’s journey toward gender equality.
With
sustained government efforts
, strong partnerships, and an unwavering focus on women-led development,
India is setting a global benchmark for inclusive and sustainable growth.
Now, more than ever,
these efforts are vital in shaping a more equitable and just world.

**********Women in Corporate Leadership, the Lived Reality
Context
Every year, International Women’s Day serves as a reminder of the progress made toward gender equality
while also highlighting the ongoing challenges women face in professional spaces.
Despite corporate efforts to project an inclusive image,
the reality of women in the workforce, especially in leadership roles, paints a starkly different picture.
Therefore,
it is crucial to examine the barriers that hinder women’s participation in leadership roles, the role of legal mandates in gender diversity
, the benefits of women in leadership, and the necessity of real empowerment rather than symbolic inclusion.
The Challenges of Women’s Participation in the Workforce
Limited Opportunities for Advancement
Women are often underrepresented in middle and senior management roles, leading to a phenomenon known as the
‘broken rung.’
This
refers to the difficulty women face in securing their first promotion
to managerial positions, which in turn limits their chances of progressing to higher leadership roles.
lack of women in middle management creates a leadership pipeline issue
, further reducing their presence in executive roles.
Preference for Male Leadership Traits
Corporate cultures often value
leadership traits traditionally associated with men,
such as assertiveness and competitiveness, over those associated with women, such as collaboration and empathy.
This bias can result in fewer women being considered for senior leadership positions
, even when they possess the necessary skills and experience.
Glass Ceiling Effect
It refers to the
invisible but real barriers
that prevent women from advancing beyond a certain level in an organisation.
While entry-level hiring may provide women with initial opportunities, these efforts often do not translate into leadership positions
due to institutional resistance and deeply ingrained workplace biases.
Unequal Access to Networks and Mentorship
Professional growth often depends on
mentorship, sponsorship, and access to influential networks
Women, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds,
frequently lack access to the same mentorship and sponsorship opportunities that their male colleagues enjoy.
This lack of professional support further limits their ability to advance within an organisation.
Unconscious Bias and Stereotypes
Women frequently face
unconscious biases
that question their capabilities, leadership potential, and commitment to their jobs.
For example,
women who exhibit strong leadership qualities may be perceived as ‘too aggressive’ or ‘bossy,’
while those who adopt a collaborative approach may be seen as lacking authority.
Such biases create a double bind
, where women must carefully balance their behaviour to be taken seriously as leaders without being penalized for deviating from traditional gender norms.
The Motherhood Penalty
One of the biggest challenges for women in the workforce is the
motherhood penalty,
where working mothers face discrimination in hiring, promotions, and pay.
Employers may assume that women with children are less committed to their jobs
, leading to fewer opportunities for career advancement.
Additionally,
workplace policies often fail to provide adequate support for working mothers,
such as paid maternity leave, flexible work arrangements, and accessible childcare.
The Role of Legal Mandates in Advancing Gender Diversity
In some regions,
legal mandates have been instrumental in increasing women’s representation
in leadership.
India,
for instance, has implemented
progressive measures to ensure women’s inclusion
in corporate governance.
Companies Act of 2013
requires public limited companies to have at least one female board member, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated that the top 1,000 listed companies appoint at least one independent female director.
As a result,
on the boards of
NSE 500 companies
has increased from
5% in 2011 to 18% in 2023.
hese legal frameworks demonstrate that structured interventions can be effective
in promoting gender diversity.
However
, for such initiatives to translate into meaningful change, companies must go beyond mere compliance
and actively develop an environment where women can lead and influence decision-making.
The Benefits of Women in Leadership and the Way Forward
Research has consistently shown that
organisations benefit when women hold leadership positions.
A more diverse leadership team expands the talent pool
, creates innovative thinking, and improves decision-making.
Women bring unique perspectives
derived from varied educational backgrounds, career experiences, and professional networks.
Their leadership style
, often characterised by collaboration and inclusivity,
enhances team performance and stakeholder engagement.
From a corporate governance perspective,
women in leadership improve risk management, strengthen shareholder value,
and drive sustainable business practices.
ompanies with strong female representation in senior roles are more likely to be recognised
for their ethical standards and employee-friendly policies.
Such recognition
not only enhances corporate reputation but also creates a cycle where
more women aspire to and attain leadership positions.
The Way Forward: Moving Beyond Token Representation
true measure of progress lies in the actual influence
and decision-making power granted to women in leadership roles.
Token appointments, where women are placed in positions without real authority,
do little to advance gender equality.
Instead,
companies must ensure that women occupy executive roles, serve as independent directors
, and lead critical board committees.
Another key factor in achieving genuine equality is pay parity.
Women must be compensated at the same level as their male counterparts,
reflecting their contributions and responsibilities.
Without equitable pay,
gender diversity initiatives remain superficial and fail to create lasting change.
Conclusion
The rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion programs
persistence of gender disparities
in leadership, and the prevalence of tokenism
all threaten to undermine hard-won gains
Legal mandates have played a crucial role in developing gender diversity,
but true progress requires organizations to actively support and empower women in leadership positions.
Beyond compliance and public relations efforts,
companies must recognise the tangible benefits of gender diversity and work toward genuine inclusivity.

Why in news?
The government will launch "Pashu Aushadhi" stores nationwide to provide affordable generic veterinary medicines. This initiative is part of the revised Livestock Health and Disease Control Programme (LHDCP), approved by the Union Cabinet headed by PM Modi.
The Pashu Aushadhi stores will be managed by
cooperative societies
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samriddhi Kendras (PMKSK
). The Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying will soon release operational guidelines for these stores.
What’s in today’s article?
Pashu Aushadhi Initiative Based on Janaushadhi Kendras
Revised Livestock Health and Disease Control Programme (LHDCP)
Significance of Pashu Aushadhi
Pashu Aushadhi Kendras to Offer Traditional Medicines
The Pashu Aushadhi initiative is modeled after the Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs), which offer affordable generic medicines to reduce healthcare costs for citizens.
Existing Janaushadhi Kendras
Currently, over 10,300 PMBJKs operate across India under the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers.
The country will observe Janaushadhi Diwas on March 7.
Generic Medicines for Animals
While PMBJKs provide generic medicines for humans, Pashu Aushadhi Kendras will offer non-branded, cost-effective veterinary medicines for animal healthcare.
Pashu Aushadhi to Improve Livestock Health
Recently, the Union Cabinet, chaired by PM Modi, has approved the revision of the Livestock Health and Disease Control Programme (LHDCP) to enhance animal healthcare and disease prevention.
The Pashu Aushadhi initiative is a key part of the revised LHDCP.
Components of LHDCP
National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP)
– Focuses on controlling major livestock diseases.
Livestock Health & Disease Control (LH&DC)
– Has three sub-components:
Critical Animal Disease Control Programme (CADCP)
– Targets severe animal diseases.
Establishment and Strengthening of Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries - Mobile Veterinary Units (ESVHD-MVU)
– Provides mobile veterinary services for doorstep healthcare.
Assistance to States for Control of Animal Diseases (ASCAD)
– Supports states in tackling livestock diseases.
Pashu Aushadhi (New Component)
– Aims to improve access to affordable generic veterinary medicines through PM-Kisan Samriddhi Kendras and Cooperative Societies.
Financial Allocation for LHDCP
The LHDCP has a total outlay of ₹3,880 crore for 2024-25 and 2025-26.
Out of this, ₹75 crore has been allocated for providing quality and affordable generic veterinary medicines and incentives for their sale under the Pashu Aushadhi component.
Objectives and Benefits of LHDCP
Disease Prevention
– Controls Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), Brucellosis, PPR, Classical Swine Fever, Lumpy Skin Disease, etc., through vaccination and immunization.
Livestock Healthcare
– Enhances disease surveillance and strengthens veterinary infrastructure.
Economic and Social Impact
– Boosts livestock productivity, prevents economic losses for farmers, generates rural employment, and promotes entrepreneurship in the veterinary sector.
As per the 20th Livestock Census (2019), India’s livestock population stands at 535.78 million, including 302.79 million bovines (cattle, buffalo, mithun, and yak).
Impact of Livestock Diseases
Various diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), Brucellosis, Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), and Lumpy Skin Disease significantly reduce livestock productivity.
While vaccination drives have been implemented, farmers still face high out-of-pocket expenses on medicines for their animals.
Role of LHDCP in Disease Prevention
The Livestock Health and Disease Control Programme (LHDCP) aims to reduce economic losses by preventing livestock diseases through immunization and improving access to affordable veterinary medicines.
Apart from generic veterinary medicines, Pashu Aushadhi Kendras will also sell
ethnoveterinary medicines
which are based on traditional beliefs and indigenous knowledge to treat animal disease
Ethnoveterinary Formulations for Livestock Health
National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)
has compiled
traditional remedies
for treating various ailments in bovines.
This includes Mastitis; Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) – mouth and foot lesions; Fever; Diarrhoea etc.
Ingredients in Traditional Animal Medicines
Ethnoveterinary formulations use natural ingredients such as coriander, garlic, bay leaves, pepper, cumin, turmeric, chirata, betel, tulsi, neem, sweet basil, jaggery, and onions for treating conditions like fever in animals.

**********USAID’s Contributions in India - Beneficiaries and Initiatives
Why in news?
The Trump administration's January 20 Executive Order ends U.S. foreign aid and effectively dismantles USAID, halting several initiatives in India.
Key affected programs include the development of a secure 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under the Indo-Pacific strategy, clean air and water projects, sanitation efforts, and numerous health initiatives.
USAID has played a significant role in India's health and population sectors for over two decades and, since 2022, has supported systems to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific.
In 2022, USAID was the fourth-largest provider of Official Development Assistance to India, contributing $228 million, following Japan ($2.97 billion), the EU ($383.5 million), and Germany ($235 million).
What’s in today’s article?
USAID Funding for India: Key Trends and Allocations
Impact of USAID Funding Cuts on India and Global Health
Total Disbursement Since 2001
USAID has provided $2.8 billion in Official Development Assistance to India since 2001.
Recent Highs in Aid (2022-2024)
2022: $228 million (highest annual disbursal).
2023: $175 million.
2024: $151 million (as of December 19).
A sharp rise in funding post-Covid-19 contributed to these record levels.
Economic Support Fund Surge
2022: $148 million allocated.
2023: $81 million allocated.
This increase was a major factor in the recent peak in US aid.
Historical Trends and Focus Areas
2001-2002:
Majority of funds directed to Food Aid and Commodity Assistance.
2003-2021:
Shift toward Health and Population programs, including polio eradication, maternal health, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis control.
2022-2024:
Focus expanded to include Covid-19 response and economic recovery efforts.
Comparison with Past Peaks
The previous peak in annual disbursal was $175 million in 2006.
The 2022-2024 period marked the first time since 2001-08 that aid exceeded $100 million annually.
The Trump administration has severely cut USAID funding to curb U.S. economic losses.
Developing countries in Asia and Africa, including India, will be affected, especially in health and social sector programs with limited government funding.
Tuberculosis Program at Risk
Breaking the Barriers, a USAID-funded TB awareness program in Karnataka, Telangana, Bihar, and Assam, will shut down.
USAID provided $7 million for this initiative in 2022-23 through the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT).
Threat to HIV/AIDS Programs
USAID and PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) have played a major role in the global fight against HIV/AIDS.
The defunding of USAID has created uncertainty and could lead to lives lost and increased HIV transmission, according to health experts.
Global Concerns Over Healthcare Funding
Experts emphasized that rich countries have a responsibility to support healthcare in poorer nations.
With 50% of the world’s population lacking access to healthcare, the funding cuts pose a severe risk to global health initiatives.
Legal Battle Over Foreign Aid
On February 13, a U.S. Federal Court stayed Trump’s order to halt foreign aid.
The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that 5,800 foreign aid projects had been reviewed, with 500 retained.
In a 5-4 verdict on March 5, the court rejected the US government’s request to cancel the February 13 order of the US Federal Court.

**********The Delimitation Debate - Balancing Representation and Federalism
Context:
The delimitation issue has resurfaced as
a contentious political debate.
Southern states
, particularly Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, have raised
concerns
over the
potential impact of population-based representation
The debate is intertwined with
North-South demographic differences
political power distribution.
The Core Issue - Population-Based Representation:
The upcoming delimitation exercise
could reduce the South’s representation
in the Lok Sabha due to lower population growth.
Southern states have historically performed
better
in the Human Development Index
(HDI) and economic indicators.
The demand to freeze the current strength
of each state in the Lok Sabha is gaining traction.
North-South Divide and Political Tensions:
Southern leaders argue that population-based representation would disadvantage them despite their progressive policies.
The push for Hindi
perceived centralization
by the Centre fuels regional tensions.
However, concerns of
North Indian domination in Parliament
remain debatable as numerical advantage have not necessarily translated into policy bias.
Challenges in Finding a Consensus:
Freezing the current representation ratio
maintains the
balance
but leads to
overburdened
representatives (approx. 20 lakh people per MP).
Avoiding the North-South binary
is crucial to prevent further polarization.
The BJP and Congress face internal contradictions as their state units take opposing stands.
Potential Solutions:
A strict population-based delimitation
could lead to numerical imbalances but aligns with
constitutional principles
An alternative approach is to expand the Lok Sabha
, ensuring no state loses seats while populous states gain additional representation.
Reforming the Rajya Sabha
to enhance federal representation could be another option, though it requires constitutional amendments.
Federalism and Democratic Representation:
Democracy
should be interpreted
beyond numbers
to include federal balance.
Past delimitation exercises
have implicitly recognized this by ensuring small states have at least one Lok Sabha member.
Expanding the Lok Sabha
can
strengthen federalism
while upholding democratic principles.
Way Ahead:
For a genuine debate on the delimitation question, it is necessary to
avoid two tempting myths.
In the first place
, many intellectuals and politicians from the South are tempted to raise alarms about North India's dominance over the South.
Secondly
, in the present party-political arena, there is a temptation to see the issue through the prism of the BJP’s dominance.
The recent statement by the Union Home Minister that states of the South will not lose any seats highlights the extent of
anti-BJP sentiment on this matter.
Conclusion:
The delimitation debate
must
move beyond political rhetoric
to a
balanced approach
Leaders must advocate for solutions that maintain both
democratic and federal integrity
Expanding representation without reducing existing seats offers a pragmatic way forward.

middle-class working women in India
(2019).
Recently, the world celebrated International Women’s Day, with companies highlighting their efforts toward including more women in the workforce. However, the reality is different. The rollback of DEI programs in the U.S. threatens women’s participation in corporate America, where they make up 48% of the workforce, raising concerns about identity erasure.
Today’s editorial talks about issues faced by women. This content is useful for writing answers in GS Paper 1 and GS Paper 2 of the UPSC Mains exam.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
International Women’s Day will be celebrated worldwide on March 8, 2025.
What challenges do women face in entering and advancing in the corporate workforce?
Gender Bias and Stereotyping:
Women often face assumptions that they are less competent or less committed due to gender-based stereotypes.
Example:
A 2023 McKinsey report found that women are 18% less likely to be promoted from entry-level to managerial roles compared to men, despite similar qualifications.
Glass Ceiling Effect:
Systemic barriers prevent women from advancing to senior leadership and executive positions.
As of 2023, only
of CEOs in Fortune 500 companies were women, reflecting limited upward mobility for women in corporate hierarchies.
Work-Life Balance and Caregiving Responsibilities:
Women are disproportionately responsible for family and household duties, making it harder to manage demanding corporate roles.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, 1 in 4 women considered downshifting or leaving their jobs due to increased caregiving burdens.
Unequal Pay and Compensation Disparities:
Women consistently earn less than their male counterparts for performing similar work.
In India, the gender pay gap remains around
19%
, with women earning significantly less than men for equivalent roles (Monster Salary Index Report, 2022).
Lack of Mentorship and Sponsorship:
Women often lack access to influential mentors who can advocate for their promotion and career growth.
A Harvard Business Review study (2021) revealed that
64% of women
reported not having a senior leader to sponsor their career advancement, limiting their growth opportunities.
Why are legal mandates like the Companies Act, 2013, and SEBI regulations crucial for increasing women’s representation in corporate leadership?
Ensuring Minimum Representation:
Legal mandates create a compulsory framework requiring companies to appoint women to leadership positions, ensuring basic gender diversity.
mandates at least
one woman director
on the board of certain public companies, increasing female representation in leadership roles.
Driving Structural Change:
Regulations push companies to institutionalize policies that promote gender diversity, fostering long-term cultural and organizational transformation.
SEBI’s 2015
directive for India’s
top 1,000 listed companies
to have at least
one independent woman director
has led to a threefold increase in women’s participation on NSE 500 boards (from
5% in 2011 to 18% in 2023
Reducing Gender Bias:
Legal mandates act as a corrective mechanism against gender-based discrimination by ensuring that women receive leadership opportunities based on merit.
Following
mandate, companies actively seek to identify and groom qualified women for board positions, reducing biases in corporate hiring practices.
Enhancing Corporate Governance:
Women in leadership roles bring diverse perspectives that strengthen decision-making, risk management, and accountability.
Research by
Credit Suisse (2021)
found that companies with
at least one woman board member
show better financial performance and stronger governance frameworks.
Setting Industry Benchmarks:
Legal frameworks establish a baseline for gender inclusion, encouraging other companies and sectors to adopt similar diversity policies.
have inspired several Indian private firms to adopt voluntary policies promoting
gender-balanced leadership
, creating a ripple effect across industries.
How does the presence of women in leadership roles benefit corporate governance?
Diverse Perspectives and Better Decision-Making:
Women leaders bring varied experiences and viewpoints, leading to more comprehensive discussions and well-rounded decisions.
Harvard Business Review (2021)
study found that boards with at least
30% women
make better strategic decisions and are more likely to consider stakeholder interests.
Enhanced Risk Management:
Women leaders tend to adopt a more cautious and analytical approach, improving risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
2019 MSCI report
showed that companies with
three or more women
on their boards experienced
lower risk
of governance-related controversies and better compliance practices.
Improved Corporate Transparency and Accountability:
Women in leadership roles advocate for ethical practices, ensuring greater transparency and stronger corporate governance frameworks.
Norway
, where a
40% quota
for women on corporate boards exists, studies have shown increased reporting standards and improved financial disclosures.
Stronger Stakeholder Engagement:
Women leaders prioritize relationship-building and stakeholder communication, fostering trust and long-term value creation.
Indian companies with
women independent directors
are more likely to engage with diverse stakeholders and prioritize corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives (SEBI Report, 2023).
Higher Corporate Performance and Reputation:
Companies with gender-diverse leadership are often recognized as more ethical, responsible, and attractive to investors.
analysis found that companies with
on their board had
higher return on equity (ROE)
and better market performance over a five-year period.
What are the steps taken by the Indian government?
Legislative Mandates for Board Diversity: The Companies Act, 2013
mandates that certain public companies must appoint
at least one woman director
on their boards.
SEBI Regulations for Independent Women Directors:
In 2015,
mandated India’s
at least one independent woman director
to ensure greater gender diversity in decision-making roles.
Gender-Specific Schemes and Incentives:
Programs like
Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP)

**********The academic link between Nepal and India
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India-Nepal relations;
Why in the News?
On February 16, a third-year female student from Nepal died by suicide at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) in Bhubaneswar.
What were the reasons behind the protests by Nepali students at KIIT, Bhubaneswar?
Harassment and University Inaction
: Nepali students protested after a third-year Nepali woman student died by suicide, allegedly due to harassment by a male student. Despite multiple complaints, the university failed to take action.
Example:
The deceased student had repeatedly reported the harassment to university authorities, but no substantial steps were taken to address her concerns.
Forced Campus Eviction
: KIIT ordered Nepali students to vacate the campus following the protests, which was viewed as an unjust punishment against the entire community.
Instead of addressing the harassment claims, the university’s eviction order further alienated Nepali students, leading to greater unrest.
Demand for Justice and Fair Treatment
: Students sought accountability for the harassment and fair treatment under the Indo-Nepal Peace Treaty of 1950, which ensures equal rights for Nepali citizens in India.
Protesters argued that the eviction violated Articles 6 and 7 of the treaty, which guarantee the right to residence and fair treatment.
Why is Nepal’s education system being influenced by the colonial legacy of British India?
Affiliation with Indian Universities
: Nepal’s first college, Tri-Chandra College (established in 1918), was affiliated with Indian universities (Calcutta and later Patna University), controlling courses, pedagogy, and examinations.
Dependence on Indian Instructors
: Early instructors in Nepal’s education system were trained in Indian universities, leading to the adoption of Indian academic frameworks.
Limited Domestic Higher Education
: Until Tribhuvan University was established in 1959, Nepal lacked postgraduate education, forcing students to seek higher education in India.
Colonial Curriculum
: The content of education remained heavily influenced by British India’s system, limiting the development of Nepal-centric academic discourse.
Post-1950 Reforms
: Efforts like the National Educational Planning Commission (1954) and New Education System Plan (1971) aimed to “Nepalise” the system, yet the intellectual field continued to be shaped by Indian education.
In what way is the KIIT incident linked to the Indo-Nepal Peace Treaty of 1950, especially Articles 6 and 7?
Violation of Equal Treatment (Article 6):
Article 6 of the
ensures that citizens of Nepal and India receive “national treatment” in each other’s territories. The directive for Nepali students to vacate the KIIT campus violated this provision by treating them differently based on their nationality.
Infringement on the Right to Residence (Article 7):
Article 7 grants Nepali citizens the right to reside in India without discrimination. KIIT’s order to vacate the premises directly infringed on this right, as it targeted Nepali students exclusively.
Impact on Educational Access (Article 7):
The Treaty allows Nepali citizens to pursue education in India without barriers. The disruption of academic activities and the evacuation order restricted their educational access, breaching this provision.
Way forward:
Strengthening Institutional Accountability:
Ensure universities establish robust grievance redressal mechanisms to address harassment complaints promptly and impartially. Independent inquiry committees should be set up to investigate incidents, ensuring transparency and justice.

It has yet to implement binding regulations on space debris disposal and re-entry control.
About the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS)
The COPUOS was
established in
1958
promote international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space
and address legal issues related to space exploration.
The committee currently has
102 member states
(as of 2022) and meets annually in
Vienna, Austria
COPUOS plays a key role in
preventing the militarization of space and ensuring responsible space activity
Historical Context
Established following the launch of
Sputnik in 1957
, COPUOS was instrumental in
preventing space from becoming a new conflict zone
Resolution 1721 (1961)
declared that
international law applies
in outer space and directed states to
report all space launches to the UN public registry
Subcommittees
Scientific and Technical Subcommittee
(meets in February).
Legal Subcommittee
(meets in April).
Space Treaties overseen by COPUOS:
COPUOS oversees
five key UN treaties and agreements
related to space activities:
Outer Space Treaty (1967):
Establishes principles for space exploration and prohibits national sovereignty over celestial bodies.
Rescue Agreement (1968):
Governs the rescue and return of astronauts and space objects.
Liability Convention (1972):
Defines responsibility for damage caused by space objects, introducing
absolute liability
for damages on Earth.
Registration Convention (1976):
Requires states to register launched space objects with the UN.
Moon Treaty (1984):
Regulates activities on the Moon and other celestial bodies.
Defining Space Debris in Law
Space debris has
no universally accepted legal definition
in international treaties.
defines it as
non-functional man-made objects in Earth orbit or re-entering the atmosphere
Legal disputes arise
over whether a piece of debris qualifies as a
“space object”
under the
1972 Liability Convention
Liability Under International Space Law
Outer Space Treaty (1967), Article VI
: States bear responsibility for national space activities, including those by private companies.
: Introduced “absolute liability”, meaning launching states are automatically responsible for damage caused by space objects.
However,
liability enforcement remains weak
, and affected nations often struggle to claim full compensation.
