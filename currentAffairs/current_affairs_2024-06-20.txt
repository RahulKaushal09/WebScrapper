PRO-TERM SPEAKER
Syllabus
Prelims – POLITY
Context:
Senior Congress leader K Suresh, as the seniormost member of the Lok Sabha, is expected to be appointed as pro-tem Speaker when the first session of the 18th Lok Sabha begins.
Background:-
The 18th Lok Sabha will hold its first session from June 24 to July 3, during which the new Speaker of the House will be elected. Until this happens, a pro-tem Speaker will be chosen to swear in the new Members of Parliament.
What is a pro-tem Speaker?
Being the Presiding Officer of the Lok Sabha, the Speaker has to fulfil certain key duties related to its day-to-day proceedings.
Article 94 of the Indian Constitution states: “Whenever the House of the People is dissolved, the Speaker shall not vacate his office until immediately before the first meeting of the House of the People after the dissolution.”
In the new Lok Sabha, the Speaker of the House is decided by a simple majority. Until her selection, the pro-tem Speaker is chosen to administer some important duties. ‘Pro-tem’ essentially means ‘for the time being’ or ‘temporarily’.
The Constitution does not mention the post. However, the official ‘Handbook on the Working of Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs’ speaks about the ‘Appointment and Swearing in of Speaker pro term’.
How is the pro-tem Speaker chosen?
The handbook states when the Speaker post falls vacant before a new Lok Sabha, “the duties of the Speaker are to be performed by a Member of the House appointed for this purpose by the President as Speaker pro tem”.
Administering oaths to the new MPs is the pro-tem Speaker’s primary duty.
Under Article 99 of the Constitution, “Every Member of the House shall, before taking his seat, make and subscribe before the President or some person appointed in that behalf by him, an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule of the Constitution.”
Normally, three other elected members of the Lok Sabha are also appointed by the President for the MPs to take oath before them. According to the handbook, the seniormost members (in terms of number of years of membership of the House) are generally chosen for the purpose, though there have been exceptions.
As soon as the new government is formed, the Legislative I Section of the Government of India prepares a list of the seniormost Lok Sabha members. It is then submitted to the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs or the Prime Minister for identifying an MP as Speaker pro-tem and another three members for oath-taking.
How are new MPs administered oaths?
After the Prime Minister’s approval, the consent of these members is obtained by the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs. The Minister then submits a note to the President, seeking approval for the appointment of the Speaker pro-tem and the other three members. They also decide the date and time of the swearing-in ceremony.
Following the approval of the President, the Ministry informs the Speaker pro-tem and other members about their appointments.
Finally, the President administers the oath to the Speaker pro-tem in the Rashtrapati Bhawan. The other three members appointed by the President are administered the oath by the Speaker pro-tem in the Lok Sabha.

STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE AND ENVIRONMENT CONCERN IN GREAT NICOBAR PROJECT
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
The Congress party has described the proposed Rs 72,000-crore infra upgrade at the Great Nicobar Island as a grave threat to the island’s indigenous inhabitants and fragile ecosystem, and demanded immediate suspension of all clearances and a thorough, impartial review of the proposed project.
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a cluster of 836 islands, split into two groups — the Andaman Islands to the north and the Nicobar Islands to the south — by the 150-km wide Ten Degree Channel.
Key Takeaways
Great Nicobar is the southernmost and largest of the Nicobar Islands, a sparsely inhabited 910-sq-km patch of mainly tropical rainforest in southeastern Bay of Bengal. Indira Point on the island, India’s southernmost point, is only 90 nautical miles (less than 170 km) from Sabang at the northern tip of Sumatra, the largest island of the Indonesian archipelago.
Great Nicobar has two national parks, a biosphere reserve, small populations of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribal peoples, and a few thousand non-tribal settlers.
The Great Nicobar Island has tropical wet evergreen forests, mountain ranges reaching almost 650 m above sea level, and coastal plains.
The leatherback sea turtle is the island’s flagship species.
The project for the “holistic development” of Great Nicobar Island was implemented after a report by NITI Aayog. A pre-feasibility report flagged the opportunity to leverage the strategic location of the island, which is roughly equidistant from Colombo in Sri Lanka to the southwest and Port Klang (Malaysia) and Singapore to the southeast.
<img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-194113 size-full" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="902" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gerp.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gerp.png 629w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gerp-209x300.png 209w" width="629"/>
It is close to the Malacca Strait, the main waterway that connects the Indian Ocean to the Pacific, and the infrastructure project is expected to allow Great Nicobar to participate in the regional and global maritime economy by becoming a major player in cargo transshipment.
It has been alleged that the project violates the rights of the tribal population, and will impact the island’s ecology with the felling of nearly a million trees.
The opposition — by wildlife conservation researchers, anthropologists, scholars, and civil society apart from the Congress — has focused on the potentially devastating impact on the Shompen, a particularly vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) of hunter-gatherers with an estimated population of a few hundred individuals who live in a tribal reserve on the island.
It is feared that the port project will destroy coral reefs with spinoff effects on the local marine ecosystem, and pose a threat to the terrestrial Nicobar Megapode bird and leatherback turtles who nest in the Galathea Bay area.
For Your Information:
The Great Nicobar project is to be implemented in three phases over the next 30 years.
The proposal: A “greenfield city” has been proposed, including an International Container Transhipment Terminal (ICTT), a greenfield international airport, a power plant, and a township for the personnel who will implement the project.
The site for the proposed ICTT and power plant is Galathea Bay on the southeastern corner of Great Nicobar Island.

INDUSTRY SEEKS REMOVAL OF ANGEL TAX
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
Amid a sharp decline in funding for startups and consequent job losses, Indian Inc has sought the removal of Angel Tax that has been a subject of heated debate between the industry and the government ever since the scope of the controversial tax was expanded in the Finance Bill 2023.
The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in its Union Budget recommendation on Tuesday suggested the removal of Section 56(2)(viib) of the Income-tax Act colloquially known as the ‘Angel Tax’ stating that the step would greatly aid capital formation in the country.
About Angel Tax
Angel Tax was first introduced in 2012 to deter the generation and use of unaccounted money through the subscription of shares of a closely held company at a value that is higher than the fair market value of the firm’s shares.
Angel tax – which is income tax at the rate of 30.6 per cent – is levied when an unlisted company issues shares to an investor at a price higher than its fair market value.
Earlier, it was imposed only on investments made by a resident investor. However the Finance Act 2023 proposed to extend Angel Tax even to non-resident investors from April 1, 2024, meaning that when a start-up raises funding from a foreign investor, that too will now be counted as income and be taxable.
The industry has argued that the government is wrong in citing the difference between valuations and actual performance as a sign of money laundering, adding that investors fund startup based on their future potential. Taxes levied on the difference between issue price of unlisted securities and its fair market value (FMV) has hurt funding, it said.
The changes in the Angel Tax provisions came at a time when an estimated 100 Indian startups laid off over 15,000 employees in 2023, as funding winter that began in 2022 persisted.
Moreover, Indian startups witnessed over 60 per cent decline in funding in terms of value in 2023.
With the latest amendment, the government had proposed to also include foreign investors in the ambit, meaning that when a start-up raises funding from a foreign investor, that too will now be counted as income and be taxable.

GHAGGAR RIVER
Prelims – GEOGRAPHY
: Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann recently conducted an on-site review of flood-prone areas along the Ghaggar River.
<img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-194115 size-full" decoding="async" height="635" sizes="(max-width: 1057px) 100vw, 1057px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ghag.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ghag.png 1057w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ghag-300x180.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ghag-768x461.png 768w" width="1057"/>
This proactive move aims to mitigate flood risks in Punjab and assess the preparedness for the upcoming monsoon season. Notably, this approach represents a significant shift from past practices, where state visits occurred post-flooding.
About GHAGGAR RIVER
The Ghaggar river rises from the Shivalik Range in northwestern Himachal Pradesh.
It is a seasonal river that flows only during the monsoon season.
The Ghaggar River flows through four states in India: Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan
The Hakra, which flows in Pakistan, is the continuation of the Ghaggar River in India, and they are together called the Ghaggar – Hakra River.
Before reaching the Ottu barrage, it is known as the Ghaggar.
Downstream of the barrage, it becomes the Hakra and flows through the Thar Desert in Pakistan.
It dries up in the Great Indian (Thar) Desert.
Historical Significance:
In pre-Harappan times, the Ghaggar was a tributary of the Sutlej River.
The Sutlej changed its course around 8,000-10,000 years ago, leaving the Ghaggar-Hakra as a system of monsoon-fed rivers terminating in the Thar Desert.
The Indus Valley Civilization thrived along the dried-up Hakra riverbed in Pakistan.
Sarasvati River Connection:
Scholars have suggested that the Ghaggar-Hakra might be the defunct remains of the Sarasvati River mentioned in the Rig Veda.
Despite drying up, it still holds historical and cultural significance.

**********India's $10 Million Contribution to Global Digital Health Initiative Delayed
Why in news?
The Global Initiative on Digital Health (GIDH) was launched during India's G20 Presidency at the Health Ministers' meeting in Gujarat in August 2023. Later, it became part of the New Delhi declaration.  India pledged a $10 million contribution as a seed fund. The GIDH officially started in February 2024. However, India has yet to fulfill its $10 million commitment due to the Department of Economic Affairs (Ministry of Finance) not approving the contribution.
What’s in today’s article?
Digital health
Digital health refers to the use of technology, such as mobile devices, software applications, and other
digital tools, to improve health and healthcare delivery
Basically, it is a multidisciplinary concept that includes
concepts from an intersection between technology and healthcare
It encompasses a wide range of technologies and services, including telemedicine, electronic health records, wearable devices, health information exchange, and more.
India’s CoWIN, UNICEF’s RapidPro and FamilyConnect etc. are few notable examples.
The real-time information platform, RapidPro, is a core solution in UNICEF’s digital health portfolio.
UNICEF’s FamilyConnect sends targeted life cycle-based messages via SMS to pregnant women, new mothers, heads of households etc.
Significance of digital health
Empowers patients
Digital tools are giving providers a more holistic view of patient health through access to data and giving patients more control over their health.
Hence, it empowers patients to make better-informed decisions about their own health.
E.g., wearable devices can monitor vital signs and provide real-time feedback to patients and clinicians.
Treatment of disease
Digital health tools provide new options for facilitating prevention, early diagnosis of life-threatening diseases, and management of chronic conditions outside of traditional health care settings.
Other benefits
Reduce inefficiencies; Improve access; Reduce costs; Increase quality, and Make medicine more personalized for patients.
Support overall universal health coverage targets
Digital health is a great enabler in delivery of healthcare services and has the potential to support overall universal health coverage targets.
This is because it can ensure availability, accessibility and affordability, and equity of health services.
For example, telemedicine allows patients to connect with healthcare providers remotely.
Challenges of digital health
Equitable access
Universalization of digital health and enabling of equitable access to healthcare services across the world, particularly for low- and middle-income countries is challenging.
The issue of accessibility becomes more daunting against the backdrop of low digital literacy and low-level of internet penetration.
Ethical Challenges related to privacy, security and data ownership
The increasing digitization of healthcare and the growth of mobile and IoT devices as data collection tools raises many ethical issues.
One commonly recurring theme relates to the
exact nature of the role of consumer tech companies
, such as Amazon, Apple etc. who have all entered the digital health domain.
Such companies offer solutions for collecting, storing and analysing health data which raises issues relating to
privacy, data protection and informed consent
Ethical challenges related to regularisation of digital health technologies
The growth of apps and technologies developed for a consumer market blurs the lines between what is medical and non-medical devices.
Data management
Due to the massive amounts of data collected from a variety of systems that store and code data differently, data interoperability is an ongoing challenge.
GIDH is one of the key deliverables of India’s G-20 Presidency.
It will consolidate the evidence and amplify recent and past gains in global digital health while strengthening mutual accountability to enhance the impact of future investments.
GIDH will be a WHO Managed Network (“Network of Networks”) that will promote equitable access to digital health.
It will do so by sharing digital goods and knowledge.
The GIDH will ensure inclusivity, integration, and alignment of healthcare goals by not leaving anyone behind.
Aims of GIDH
ALIGN
efforts to support the Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020–2025;
SUPPORT
quality assured technical assistance to develop and strengthen standards-based and interoperable systems aligned to global best practices, norms and standards;
FACILITATE
the deliberate use of quality assured digital transformation tools that enable governments to manage their digital health transformation journey.
Pillars of GIDH
It will have
four pillars:
investment tracker; ask tracker to track technologies the countries need; a library of available digital tools, and a platform for knowledge-sharing to implement these technologies at scale.
Strategies to be employed by GIDH
GIDH will bring countries and partners together to achieve measurable outcomes by:
developing clear
priority-driven investment plans
for digital health transformation;
improving
reporting and transparency
of digital health resources;
knowledge exchange and collaboration
across regions and countries to accelerate progress;
technical and financial support
to the implementation of the Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020–2025 and its next phase.

**********2024 Hindu Kush Himalayas snow update
Why in news?
As per the Hindu Kush Himalaya snow update of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) report, the Ganga River basin — India’s largest — reached a record low snow persistence in 2024.The Brahmaputra and the Indus basins have suffered similarly, threatening water supply to millions of people.
What’s in today’s article?
Snow persistence
Key highlights of the report
What explains the lower and higher snow persistence in 2024?
Way forward
About
The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region is a vast mountain area that stretches across
eight countries
: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan.
This region is often called the
"Third Pole"
because it contains the largest amount of ice and snow outside of the polar regions.
Source of 10 large Asian river systems
It is the source of ten large Asian river systems – the Amu Darya, Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Irrawaddy, Salween, Mekong, Yangtse, Yellow River, and Tarim.
The basins of these rivers provide water to 1.9 billion people, a fourth of the world’s population.
Snow covered area
A considerable volume of water resources is stored as snow and glacier ice in the HKH.
Cryosphere components including permafrost and glacial lakes provide various ecosystem services for mountain and downstream communities.
Indian areas in HKH region
Entire territory of 11 mountain states/UTs (Jammu & Kashmir (Indian administered area), Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh), & Darjeeling district of West Bengal state lies in HKH region.
ICIMOD is a regional intergovernmental learning and knowledge-sharing center.
Established
-It was established in 1983 with its
headquarters in Kathmandu, Nepal
Member Countries
- It serves
member countries in HKH region: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan.
Focus Areas
Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability: Monitoring climate change impacts and promoting adaptive measures.
Livelihoods and Poverty Reduction: Supporting sustainable livelihoods and reducing poverty in mountain communities.
Ecosystem Management: Promoting the sustainable management of mountain ecosystems.
Water Resources: Ensuring sustainable management and use of water resources.
Disaster Risk Reduction: Enhancing resilience to natural disasters in the region.
Snow persistence refers to the duration of time that snow remains on the ground in a specific area.
It is a measure of how long snow cover is present during a given period, typically over a season or year.
Snow persistence is an important indicator in various fields, such as hydrology, climatology, and ecology, as it influences water availability, climate patterns, and ecosystem health.
Factors Influencing Snow Persistence
Temperature: Warmer temperatures lead to faster melting of snow, reducing snow persistence.
Precipitation: The amount and type (snow vs. rain) of precipitation.
Elevation: Higher elevations typically have longer snow persistence due to cooler temperatures.
Vegetation: Dense vegetation can insulate snow, slowing its melt and increasing persistence.
Topography: The shape and slope of the land can influence how snow accumulates and melts.
The authors of the 2024 HKH snow update analysed data from 2003 to 2024.
They found significant fluctuations in snow persistence between November and April every year, when snow accumulates above ground.
Snow Persistence Trends in India (2024)
Ganga River Basin:
Lowest in 22 Years: 17% below long-term historical average
Previous Record (2018): 15.2% below normal
High (2015): 25.6% above normal
Brahmaputra River Basin:
2024: 14.6% below normal
Worse(2021): 15.5% below normal
Indus River Basin:
2024: 23.3% below normal
Offset: Excesses in lower altitudes
Implications
Crucial for rivers like Ganga
Snow persistence is crucial for the Ganga River basin as its melt contributes 10.3% of the water, compared to 3.1% from glacier melts.
In the Brahmaputra and Indus basins, snowmelt provides 13.2% and around 40% of the water, respectively, versus 1.8% and 5% from glaciers.
Regional Impact
: Significant reductions in snow persistence are expected to have a lasting effect on water supply for millions of people.
Downstream Effects
: These changes threaten water availability and agriculture in downstream regions.
What explains the lower and highersnow persistence in 2024?
Lower snow persistence
Weak Western Disturbances
: Identified as the main cause for lower snow persistence in 2024.
It originates in Mediterranean Sea and brings rain and snow to the HKH region in winter.
However, high sea-surface temperatures in the origin regions weakened and delayed these disturbances, reducing winter precipitation and snowfall.
Changing Climate and Global Warming
: Increasing instability in weather patterns.
Exacerbation by La Niña–El Niño
: Prolonged and intense phases significantly influence global weather patterns, including western disturbances.
Higher snow persistence
- Snow persistence in the Yellow River basin was 20.2% above normal in 2024.
East Asian Winter Monsoon
: Brings cold, dry air from Siberia and Mongolia.
Interaction with Moist Air
: Cold air interacts with moist air from the Pacific Ocean. As a result, there was snowfall over higher altitudes in the upper Yellow River basin and eastern Himalaya.
Experts suggest that
reforestation with native tree species
can help the ground retain more snow.
Improved weather forecasting and early warning systems can help local communities prepare for water stress.
Better water infrastructure and policies to protect snowfall areas are also essential.
Involving communities in decision-making and promoting regional cooperation are vital for sustainability.
Reducing emissions is crucial to mitigate increasing sea-surface and ground temperatures, which lower snow persistence.
Emphasizing the need for political will, experts highlighted the importance of cutting fossil energy consumption and production, especially among G-20 countries, which account for 81% of all emissions.

**********Revival of Ancient Nalanda Mahavihara
Why in News?
The Prime Minister of India inaugurated the new campus of Nalanda University in Rajgir, Bihar. The new campus is near the ancient ruins of Nalanda University, which was established through the Nalanda University Act 2010, enacted following a decision made at the 2nd East Asia Summit in the Philippines in 2007.
What’s in Today’s Article?
The Ancient Nalanda Mahavihara
Revival of Nalanda University
Features of the New Nalanda University Campus
Highlights of the PM's Address at the New Nalanda University Inauguration
The Ancient Nalanda Mahavihara:
Nalanda was a renowned Buddhist mahavihara
(great monastery) in ancient and medieval
Magadha
(modern-day Bihar), near the city of Rajagriha (now Rajgir) and about 90 kms southeast of Pataliputra (now Patna).
It was established by Kumargupta I
- the ruler of Gupta Empire (c. 3rd to 6th century CE), and is considered to be
among the greatest centres of learning in the ancient world
It played a vital role
in promoting the patronage of arts and academics during the 5th and 6th century CE, a period that has since been described as the "Golden Age of India" by scholars.
The chronicles of seventh century Chinese traveller
Hsuan Tsang
provide the most detailed description of ancient Nalanda.
After Guptas
, Nalanda continued to thrive with the support of the rulers of the
Pala Empire
and may have been attacked (in 1190s) and
damaged by Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji
- a Turko-Afghan military general.
After being lost for six centuries,
the university was rediscovered in 1812 by Scottish surveyor Francis Buchanan-Hamilton.
Later (in 1861), it was officially identified as the ancient university by
Sir Alexander Cunningham.
The current site of Nalanda is a
UNESCO World Heritage Site
and the Government of India enacted a law in 2010 to revive the famous university
The contemporary Nalanda University at Rajgir
has been listed as an "
Institute of National Importance
" by the Government of India.
Revival of Nalanda University:
In a bid to revive its legacy, the idea to re-establish Nalanda University was proposed by former president
Dr APJ Abdul Kalam in 2006.
In 2007
, the proposal to re-establish Nalanda was endorsed at the East Asia Summit in Mandaue, Philippines, and was reiterated in the East Asia Summit of 2009, in Hua Hin, Thailand.
This vision gained momentum with the passing of the Nalanda University Bill in 2010 in the Indian Parliament,
leading to its operational launch in 2014
from a temporary location near Rajgir.
Former president Pranab Mukherjee laid the foundation
stone for the permanent campus in 2016 at Pilkhi village, Rajgir.
Construction commenced in 2017
and the university became fully functional by 2022, culminating in the inauguration of the new campus recently.
In total,
17 countries other than India
, including Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, etc - have helped set up the university.
Features of the New Nalanda University Campus:
The architecture of the university,
situated on a sprawling 455 acres of land, fuses both the modern and ancient styles.
The new campus integrates eco-friendly architecture, ensuring a net-zero carbon footprint.
The university currently operates six schools
, covering Buddhist studies, historical studies, ecology, sustainable development, languages, literature, and international relations.
Additionally, it hosts four centres
specialising in Bay of Bengal Studies, Indo-Persian Studies, Conflict Resolution, and a Common Archival Resource Center.
It offers a range of programs including
postgraduate and doctoral research courses, short-term certificate courses, and scholarships for international students, reflecting its commitment to global academic excellence.
Highlights of the PM's Address at the New Nalanda University Inauguration:
Nalanda University is a proclamation of the fact that
knowledge cannot be destroyed by fire.
Nalanda University would add a new dimension
to the idea of world brotherhood and become the identity of India’s development journey.
The Renaissance of Nalanda will tell the world about India’s capacity and will help India become
a global hub for knowledge and education.
History was proof that all developed countries became economic and cultural leaders only after they made a mark in the field of education.
India currently has 23 IITs, 21 IIMs
and has witnessed the setting up of one university every week in the last 10 years, along with establishment of an industrial training institute every 10 days.
Major reforms are going on in the education sector,
which includes the National Education Policy 2020.

**********CIL Awards Underground Mines to Private Players to Bolster Revenue Stream
Why in the News?
In an effort to bolster its revenue stream, national miner Coal India Ltd (CIL) has awarded its abandoned coal mines to private players on a revenue-sharing model.
CIL had identified 23 coal mines — most of them underground ones — which were closed or discontinued for technical or financial reasons.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Coal (Distribution across World & India)
Coal in India (Types, Problems, India’s Dependence on Coal, Revenue Sharing Model, etc.)
News Summary
Distribution of Coal Across the World:
Coal is a widespread resource for energy and chemicals.
The quantities of proven coal reserves in the world are typically shown in Millions of Tons of Coal Equivalent (MTCE).
Nearly 75 per cent of the world’s recoverable coal resources are controlled by five countries:
United States
(~22 per cent)
Russia
(~15 per cent)
Australia
(~14 per cent)
China
(~13 per cent)
(~10 per cent)
India’s Coal Reserves:
Commercial coal-mining industry has been in operation since 1774, launched by the East India Company along the Damodar River in West Bengal.
70 per cent of India’s coal supply comes from the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.
State-owned
Coal India Limited
has a virtual monopoly on coal mines in India, which produce roughly 75 per cent of the coal burned in India’s coal-fired power stations.
Types of Coal in India:
India has four primary types of coal based on their carbon content and energy potential. Each type of coal varies in its properties and uses.
Here are the types of coal found in India:
Problems With Coal Found in India:
High Ash Content:
Issue
: Indian coal generally has high ash content, ranging from 20% to 45%.
Impact
: High ash content reduces the calorific value, increasing the cost of coal handling and transportation, and results in more waste and pollution.
Lower Calorific Value:
: Indian coal has a lower calorific value compared to imported coal.
: This necessitates burning more coal to produce the same amount of energy, leading to higher emissions and inefficiencies in power generation.
Limited Coking Coal:
: India has a shortage of high-quality coking coal, which is essential for steel production.
: This necessitates the import of coking coal, increasing costs and dependence on foreign sources.
Environmental Concerns:
: Coal mining and combustion contribute significantly to air pollution, water contamination, and deforestation.
: These environmental issues have severe health implications and contribute to climate change, making coal less sustainable in the long term.
India’s Dependence on Coal for Energy Supply:
While renewable energy capacity is dramatically increasing,
coal still provides around 70 per cent of the country’s electricity
Coal is expected to account for at least 21 per cent of India’s electricity requirements even by 2050.
Easily Available Source of Power
Alternatives like nuclear energy have been hampered by high costs and safety concerns.
India’s Developmental Needs
International Energy Agency
(IEA) predicts that between 2020 and 2040, India will have the largest growth in energy demand of any country in the world.
To meet this demand, India will need to rely on a variety of energy sources—both conventional and renewable.
Source of Employment
Around 4 million people in India are employed either directly or indirectly in the coal sector.
Other than active workers, another 500,000 Indians rely on the coal sector for their pensions.
Source of Revenue for the Government
Coal India Limited is the largest coal mining company in the world.
The coal sector is a major source of revenue for States and the Central Government.
Revenue Sharing Model for Coal Plants:
The revenue sharing model involves collaboration between Coal India Ltd (CIL) and private players.
Revenue Sharing Framework
Structure
: Private players are awarded contracts to operate abandoned or underutilized coal mines on a revenue-sharing basis with Coal India Ltd (CIL).
Revenue Split
: The revenue generated from coal sales is shared between CIL and the private operators based on agreed terms.
Identification of Mines
Selected Mines
: CIL identified 23 abandoned or discontinued mines, mostly underground, with a cumulative peak-rated capacity of 34.14 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) and estimated reserves of 635 million tonnes (MT).
Operational Mechanism
Mine Developer and Operator (MDO)
: Private operators, also known as Mine Developer and Operators (MDOs), are responsible for the coal extraction and production process.
Freedom in Operations
: MDOs have the autonomy to choose their technology, methods, and machinery for coal extraction.
Auction Process
Market-Driven Pricing
: Coal mined from these sites is sold at market-driven prices through an auction process managed by the operators on behalf of the authority.
News Summary:
assigned its abandoned coal mines to private players on a revenue-sharing model to boost domestic production and reduce imports
Out of 23 identified mines, which have a combined capacity of 34.14 MTPA and reserves of 635 MT, most were closed for technical or financial reasons.
This initiative, aimed at increasing industry participation, will see 75% of coal excavation outsourced to private operators, with a goal to reach 90% in five years.
While the revenue impact is modest (10-12%), the focus is on quicker production turnaround and environmental benefits.
These mines will sell coal at market prices through auctions and support coal gasification projects.
CIL reported a 7.28% increase in coal production, reaching 160.25MT, and a 27% growth in production from captive and commercial mines.

Why in the news?
International attention is urgently needed to address the worsening mental health crisis among Rohingya refugees in India.
About Rohingya Sufferings
Trauma and Mental Health:
Rohingya refugees in Delhi experience severe trauma, including anxiety, dissociative episodes, and depression, often due to past experiences in Myanmar and ongoing re-traumatization from living conditions and violence in India.
Living Conditions:
Rohingya refugees live in shanty-like huts prone to accidental and intentionally set fires, leading to constant fear and re-traumatization.
Discrimination and Legal Status:
Officially labelled as “illegal immigrants,” Rohingya refugees face severe discrimination in India. They are denied full access to education, healthcare, legal services, and formal employment opportunities.
Detention and Deportation:
Fear of arbitrary detention and deportation is widespread, despite many having UNHCR refugee cards. At least 500 Rohingya, including women and children, are detained in centres across India without criminal charges, some for decades.
Civil Society and Funding:
Civil society organizations working with Rohingya refugees face funding challenges due to cancelled FCRA licenses. Many support programs have shut down or reduced operations, leaving few UNHCR-supported organizations to cautiously continue their work.
About unsolved Tibetan issue
The Tibetan issue in India is a complex and contentious topic with historical, cultural, and political implications.
Historical Background

**********What are the findings of the 2024 Hindu Kush Himalayas snow update? | Explained
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Data related to Low snow persistence
Mains level:
Role of climate change in low levels of snowmelt this year
Why in the news?
In 2024, the Hindu Kush Himalaya snow update from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) reported that the Ganga River basin, India’s largest, experienced its lowest recorded snow persistence.
What does the report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development highlight?
Record Low Snow Persistence:
The Ganga River basin, along with the Brahmaputra and Indus basins, reached record low snow persistence in 2024.
Significant Declines:
The Ganga basin recorded its lowest snow persistence in 22 years, 17% below the long-term historical average. The Brahmaputra basin was 14.6% below normal, and the Indus basin fell 23.3% below normal.
Broader Impacts:
Similar low snow persistence was recorded in the Amu Darya and Helmand river basins, significantly below normal levels.
How important is snow persistence?
Water Supply:
Snow persistence, the fraction of time snow is on the ground, is crucial as its melt provides significant water to streams and ecosystems.
Runoff Contribution:
Snowmelt contributes 23% of the runoff to the HKH region’s 12 major river basins, supporting nearly one-fourth of the world’s population.
Regional Significance:
The HKH mountains, known as the “water towers of Asia,” are vital for 10 major river systems, including the Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Indus, which are essential freshwater sources for millions.
How much of a role does climate change play in river basins receiving low levels of snowmelt this year?
Weak Western Disturbances:
Lower persistence in 2024 was primarily due to weak Western disturbances, which are low-pressure systems bringing rain and snow to the HKH region.
Global Warming Effects:
Climate change and global warming destabilize weather patterns, exacerbating prolonged La Niña–El Niño conditions, and influencing the arrival and intensity of western disturbances.
High Sea-Surface Temperatures:
Persistently high sea-surface temperatures in the regions where western disturbances originate disrupt their formation, leading to reduced snowfall.
Changed the weather system:
The pattern of high temperatures and altered weather systems explains both the record low snow persistence in 2024 and similar historical records.
Way forward:
Integrated Water Management:
Develop comprehensive water management plans that incorporate predictions of reduced snowmelt. This includes optimising reservoir operations, prioritising water allocation, and implementing efficient irrigation practices to mitigate water scarcity risks.
Transboundary Collaboration:
Foster regional cooperation among countries sharing river basins affected by declining snow persistence. Develop joint strategies for sustainable water management, disaster risk reduction, and climate change adaptation. This includes sharing hydrological data, coordinating emergency responses, and implementing mutual benefit agreements.
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions:
Strengthen efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions at local, national, and international levels. Promote renewable energy sources and sustainable practices to curb global warming, thereby stabilising weather patterns crucial for snowfall.
Mains PYQ:
Climate change’ is a global problem. How India will be affected by climate change? How Himalayan and coastal states of India will be affected by climate change?

**********Thailand to become third Asian country to legalise same-sex marriage  
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Legalisation of same-sex marriage in Asian countries
Why in the news?
On Tuesday, June 18, the Marriage Equality Bill was approved by the Thai Senate, the upper house of Thailand’s National Assembly, with overwhelming support.
What does the bill entail?
Gender-Neutral Language:
The bill replaces gender-specific terms such as “husbands” and “wives” in Thai marriage laws with gender-neutral terms like “spouse” and “person”. This change allows any two individuals, regardless of their gender, to marry each other.
Equal Rights:
Same-sex couples will have the same rights as heterosexual couples in various legal and practical aspects, including:
Adoption rights:
Same-sex couples can adopt children.
Inheritance rights:
They are entitled to inherit property from their spouses.
Tax benefits:
They will receive similar tax benefits as heterosexual married couples.
Legal decision-making:
They can make legal decisions on behalf of their spouses, such as consenting to medical treatment.
Recognition and Protection:
The bill ensures that same-sex marriages are legally recognised and protected, providing stability and legal security to LGBTQ+ couples in Thailand.
Public Support:
The bill’s passage reflects growing societal acceptance and support for LGBTQ+ rights in Thailand. Public opinion has been largely positive, with significant cross-party support in the Thai Senate and lower house of the National Assembly.
What about other Asian countries?
Criminalization:
Many Asian countries, beyond those mentioned (Thailand, Taiwan, Nepal), still criminalize same-sex sexual activity. This includes countries like Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, where laws derived from colonial-era penal codes often penalize homosexuality with imprisonment or fines.
Lack of Legal Recognition:
Most Asian nations do not legally recognize same-sex marriages or partnerships. Even in countries where same-sex relations are not explicitly criminalized, there is often no legal framework for marriage or civil unions for LGBTQ+ individuals.
Legal Battles:
In countries like India, legal battles continue as activists seek to overturn discriminatory laws and secure legal recognition for same-sex relationships, including marriage.
International Pressure:
International human rights organizations and diplomatic efforts sometimes exert pressure on Asian governments to improve LGBTQ+ rights. However, progress is often slow and faces strong domestic resistance.
Note:
Currently, same-sex marriage is legal in 36 countries (not including Thailand) globally, according to LGBTQ+ rights advocacy Human Rights Campaign.
Way forward:
Legal Challenges and Reform:
Support ongoing legal challenges in courts across Asia to overturn discriminatory laws and promote legal recognition of same-sex relationships. This includes advocating for legislative reforms that protect LGBTQ+ rights, including the recognition of same-sex marriages or civil unions.
International Pressure and Diplomacy:
Encourage international human rights bodies, governments, and diplomatic missions to engage with Asian countries diplomatically, urging them to uphold international human rights standards, including LGBTQ+ rights.

**********CRISPR Cas9 Gene Therapy for Sickle Cell Disease
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/india-getting-close-to-developing-gene-therapy-for-sickle-cell-disease-say-officials/article68308487.ece
Why in the News?
India is close to developing a gene therapy using CRISPR-Cas9, a gene-editing tool for sickle cell disease (SCD).
SCD is a genetic blood disorder prevalent among the Scheduled Tribes.
What is Sickle Cell Disease?
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of
inherited blood disorders
caused by a
genetic mutation
hemoglobin-β gene
located on
chromosome 11
This mutation results in
defective hemoglobin
, which forms rod-like structures after releasing oxygen.
As a result,
red blood cells become rigid
and assume a
sickle shape
The disease is
in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both parents must carry the abnormal gene for a child to inherit it.
Symptoms may not manifest immediately
in newborns but can include extreme tiredness, fussiness, swollen hands and feet, and jaundice.
Implications:
mis-shapen RBCs
block small blood vessels
, leading to impaired blood flow and causing chronic anaemia.
Individuals with SCD often experience
acute pain episodes
severe bacterial infections
, and tissue damage due to inadequate blood supply.
Treatment:
Presently treatment includes medications for pain relief, regular blood transfusions to replace damaged red blood cells.
In rare cases, a
bone marrow
stem cell transplant
, which carries significant risks, is recommended.
Eliminating Sickle Cell Disease: Global and National Context
This progress follows the approval of
CRISPR-Cas9 technology
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a cell-based gene therapy
to treat sickle cell disease
in December 2023.
One of the main challenges for India is to develop a cost-effective therapy, as part of its mission to
eradicate sickle cell disease by 2047
, launched by Prime Minister in July 2023.
The mission aims to conduct over
7 crore screenings
among vulnerable tribal populations across 17 States and Union Territories, with three crore screenings completed so far.
Back2Basics: CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing
CRISPR-Cas9 stands for
lustered
egularly
nterspaced
hort
alindromic
epeats and CRISPR-associated
protein 9
It is a technology that allows geneticists and researchers to
edit parts of the genome by altering sections of the DNA sequence.
Emmanuelle Charpentier
Jennifer Doudna
’s work on CRISPR-Cas9 as a ‘
molecular scissor’
earned them the
2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry
The system consists of two key components:
: This is the enzyme that acts like a pair of molecular scissors. It is responsible for cutting the DNA strand at a specific location, allowing for the removal, addition, or alteration of DNA at that site.
Guide RNA (gRNA)
: This is a piece of RNA that is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence of DNA that matches its code. The gRNA guides the Cas9 enzyme to the exact spot in the genome where an edit is desired.
Mechanism
The process begins with the design of a gRNA that matches the DNA sequence where an edit is needed.
Once inside the cell, the Cas9 enzyme and the gRNA form a complex that can identify and bind to the target DNA sequence.
The Cas9 then cuts the DNA at this location.
After the DNA is cut, the cell’s natural repair mechanisms can be harnessed to add or remove genetic material, or to make specific changes to the DNA.
PYQ:
[2023]
Consider the following statements in the context interventions being undertaken under Anaemin Mukt Bharat Strategy :
It provides prophylactic calcium supplementation for pre-school children, adolescents and pregnant women.

involves training on noisy data
de-noising to predict accurate protein structures
Working:
Given an input list of molecules, AlphaFold 3 generates their joint 3D structure, revealing how they all fit together.
It models large biomolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA, as well as small molecules, also known as ligands — a category encompassing many drugs.
Applications of AlphaFold 3
AlphaFold 3 excels in predicting protein structures and interactions, aiding drug discovery efforts.
DeepMind’s spin-off, Isomorphic Labs, utilizes AlphaFold 3 for drug candidate identification.
Challenges
The model’s code restriction has sparked criticism among researchers for hindering scientific collaboration and transparency.
