IMMIGRATION AND FOREIGNERS BILL, 2025
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
The Immigration and Foreigners Bill, 2025, is likely to be introduced by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the ongoing Budget session of Parliament.
The proposed legislation will replace the existing laws — the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939; the Foreigners Act, 1946; and the Immigration (Carriers’ Liability) Act, 2000.
The acts, namely the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939, and the Foreigners Act, 1946, are not only of the pre-Constitution period but also, they were brought into extraordinary times of first and second world wars. While there is an underlying continuity and commonality of objectives among the four Acts, there are some overlapping provisions among the said laws.
The Bill will specify the matters relating to foreigners and their registration, the provisions relating to the obligation of universities and educational institutions admitting any foreigner, the obligation of hospitals, nursing homes or any other medical institution admitting foreigners.
The bill specifies the role of “every person occupying or having under his control any residential premises” to submit to the registration officer information in respect to any foreigners accommodated in such premises.
It mandates every university and educational institution admitting any foreigner to furnish information to the registration officer.
Similarly, it specifies the role of “every hospital, nursing home or any other such medical institution providing medical, lodging or sleeping facility in their premises” to inform the authority (registration officer) about “any foreigner taking indoor medical treatment or their attendant for whom such lodging or sleeping facility has been provided”.
The Bill obligates the carriers such as airlines and vessels to remove a passenger denied entry by the immigration officer and provide passenger and crew data to the authorities in advance. The bill carries a provision of up to ₹5 lakh in fine for violating carriers.

NARI ADALATS
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
The government has written to states inviting proposals to establish ‘Nari Adalats’, Women and Child Development Minister Annpurna Devi said.
The ministry intends to extend the  scheme, already  running on a pilot basis in Assam and J&K, to other states.
Nari Adalats are women-led alternative dispute resolution forums established under the “Sambal” sub-scheme of Mission Shakti by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
These forums aim to provide women with an accessible grievance redressal mechanism at the gram panchayat level, addressing cases of petty nature such as harassment, subversion, or curtailment of rights.
Key Features:
Structure: Each Nari Adalat comprises 7 to 11 members, known as ‘Nyaya Sakhis,’ who are nominated by the gram panchayat.
Functioning: These forums resolve disputes through negotiation, mediation, and reconciliation, ensuring speedy, accessible, and affordable justice for women.
Implementation: Initially launched on a pilot basis in 2023 in 50 gram panchayats each in Assam and Jammu & Kashmir, the program has seen success, prompting the Ministry to invite proposals from other states and Union Territories for expansion.

PRESIDENT’S RULE AMONG OPTIONS FOR MANIPUR
A significant temperature drop has been observed across North India due to a western disturbance currently positioned over North Pakistan, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported.
After N Biren Singh resigned as Manipur’s Chief Minister, the BJP leadership is exploring its options. If the party fails to find a consensus CM candidate, the state may have to be put under President’s rule.
The imposition of President’s Rule under Article 356 effectively transfers all the functions of the state government to the Centre and the function of the state legislature to Parliament during the period when it is in force.
The process begins if the President, on receiving a report from the Governor, is “satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution”.
President will issue a ‘Proclamation’, which can remain in force for up to two months. The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha must approve it through a resolution before this period expires for it to remain operative further. If approved, the proclamation of President’s Rule can be extended to six months and Parliament can approve further six-month extensions for up to three years.
Certain conditions must be met before a proclamation can be renewed by Parliament beyond a year since it was first issued. Further extensions can only be approved if an Emergency has been declared in the country or that particular state, or if the Election Commission certifies that President’s Rule is necessary due to difficulties in conducting state elections.
Since 1950, when the Constitution first came into force, President’s Rule has been imposed a total of 134 times across 29 states and UTs.
It has been imposed most frequently in Manipur and Uttar Pradesh, at 10 times each. However, these are not the states (including UTs) that have spent the most time under central control. That distinction is held by Jammu & Kashmir, followed by Punjab and Puducherry.
Since 1950, Jammu and Kashmir has spent over 12 years (4,668 days) under President’s Rule and Punjab has been under Central control for over 10 years (3,878 days) in the same period. In both states, this is largely owed to recurring spells of militant and separatist activity, and unstable law and order situations.

DAYANAND SARASWATI
Prelims – HISTORY
12th February marked the 201st birth anniversary of Dayanand Saraswati.
In 2023, to commemorate his 200th birth anniversary, a year-long celebration was held across India.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, India’s second President, called Dayanand Saraswati ‘a maker of modern India.’
Dayanand Saraswati was born on February 12, 1824, in Morbi, Kathiawar, Gujarat.
In 1875, he founded the Arya Samaj. Arya Samaj played a crucial role in social awakening through its emphasis on social reforms and education. This was a monotheistic Hindu order that rejected the ritualistic excesses and social dogmas of orthodox Hinduism and promoted a united Hindu society on the basis of Vedic teachings.
Among his various beliefs included a rejection of idolatry and the overly ritualistic traditions of Hinduism, support for women’s education, denunciation of child marriage, and an opposition to untouchability.
His magnum opus, Satyarth Prakash (1875), emphasised the “return to Vedic principles” that Dayanand Saraswati believed “had been lost” over time. The book uses the language of religious revivalism.
He advocated for worshipping of one Supreme God and followed simple rituals and recitation of Vedic mantras. All other religions were rejected by him and he wanted Hindus who had converted to other religions to return to Hinduism based on the Vedas.
He also emerged as an early proponent of cow protection, who first published Gokarun·aˉnidhi , a pamphlet in 1881, which circulated his concerns against cattle slaughter. He later on went to establish a committee for the protection of cows called Gaurakshini Sabha in 1882.
After he died in 1883 his followers established a school in Punjab in his name – Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) School to educate children in modern subjects and at the same time keep them in touch with their religion and culture.
Philosophy of Dayanand Saraswati
Crucial among his “ten founding principles of Arya Samaj” is the idea that all activities must be done for the benefit of humankind as a whole, rather than individuals or even idols and religious symbols.
This universalism was directly antithetical to the caste system. While Dayanand did not fully oppose the institution of caste itself, he advocated for significant reform within it.
Citing the Vedas, he claimed that caste is not supposed to be hereditary but rather based on an individual’s talents and disposition.
Furthermore, he was against the practice of untouchability, which he believed was an outcome of centuries of Brahmanical domination. Crucially, he advocated Vedic education for all castes.
He campaigned for the education of women as well as against ‘regressive practices’ such as child marriage.

**********Einstein Ring
Recently, the European Space Agency’s Euclid space telescope has discovered a rare ring of light, known as an Einstein ring, around a galaxy nearly 590 million light-years away from Earth.
About Einstein Ring:
It is a
ring of light around
a form of
dark matter, galaxy or cluster of galaxies
It is essentially an
example of gravitational lensing
Einstein rings
are not visible to the naked eye
, and can be observed only through space telescopes such as Euclid.
In the case of the recently discovered Einstein ring, NGC 6505 was the gravitational lens.
The nearer galaxy distorted and amplified the light coming from a distant unnamed galaxy, located 4.42 billion light-years away.
The first Einstein ring was discovered in 1987, and since then, several more have been discovered.
Significance of Einstein ring:
These rings
help scientists investigate dark matter
, which has never been detected but is believed to make up 85% of the total matter in the universe.
They enable scientists to
learn about distant galaxies,
which otherwise might not be visible.
They can also
provide information
about the
expansion of the universe
as the space between the Earth and other galaxies — both in the foreground and the background
What is Gravitational lensing?
It is a phenomenon which occurs when a
massive celestial body
— such as a galaxy or cluster of galaxies — creates a gravitational field which
distorts and amplifies the light
from distant galaxies that are behind it but in the same line of sight.
The body causing the light to curve is called a gravitational lens.

About MITRA Platform:
Mutual Fund Investment Tracing and Retrieval Assistant
(MITRA) will assist investors in tracking and
reclaiming inactive or unclaimed mutual fund folios.
Features:
The platform addresses a growing concern wherein investors, over time, lose
track of their mutual fund investments
lack of updated contact information, or unawareness of investments made in their name.
It will allow investors to
identify the overlooked investments
or any investments made by any other person for which he/she may be rightful legal claimant and also encourage them to do KYC as per the current norms thus reducing the number of non-KYC compliant folios.
It is
developed by the Registrar and Transfer Agent
(RTAs) to provide investors with a searchable database of inactive and unclaimed mutual fund folios at an industry-level which will empower the investors.
The criteria for classifying a folio as inactive include an absence of investor-initiated transactions, financial or non-financial, for a period of ten years, despite having a unit balance.
SEBI has also revised the mandate of the
Unit Holder Protection Committee
(UHPC) under Mutual Funds rules.
The UHPC will now be responsible for
reviewing inactive folios
along with unclaimed dividends and redemptions, ensuring proactive steps are taken to reduce such cases.

**********Dokra artwork
Recently, the Prime Minister of India presented French President Emmanuel Macron with a meticulously crafted Dokra artwork.
About Dokra Artwork:
Dokra art whichis also
known as bell metal craft
traces its origins back more than 4,000 years.
It is a form of folk art practiced by the
Dhokra Damar tribes,
who are traditionally metalsmiths.
These artisans are primarily found in eastern India, including
West Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand,
with a notable presence in
Chhattisgarh
as well.
Features of
No two pieces are ever the same.
Each sculpture is
painstakingly handcrafted,
drawing inspiration from mythology, nature, and daily rituals.
Process of Dokra Artwork:
The method of making Dokra is done by combining the metallurgical skills with that of the
lost wax technique.
Artisans begin by sculpting a
basic clay model
of the desired object.
This model is
then coated in wax,
where fine details are meticulously etched. Another clay layer is added to form a mold, into which molten metal—typically
brass or copper—is poured
The heat melts the beeswax, allowing the liquid metal to take the shape of the original model. Once cooled and hardened, the outer clay mold is broken away, revealing the finished sculpture.

**********Should Convicted Persons Be Allowed to Contest Elections?
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court is hearing petitions filed by Ashwin Upadhyay and others, seeking a life time ban on convicted persons from contesting elections.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, Legal Framework, Arguments in Favour / Against, Challenges, Significance, etc.)
Introduction:
The question of whether convicted persons should be allowed to contest elections in India has been a subject of debate for years.
While the Indian Constitution upholds the principles of democracy and representation, it also mandates ethical standards for lawmakers.
The Supreme Court of India, the Election Commission, and various legal experts have weighed in on this issue, making it a significant topic in electoral reforms.
Legal Framework Governing Convicted Persons in Elections:
Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RPA)
It lays down the eligibility criteria for candidates contesting elections.
Section 8(1) and 8(2):
Disqualifies individuals convicted of certain serious offenses such as terrorism, corruption, and sexual crimes from contesting elections for a specified period.
Section 8(3):
Any individual sentenced to imprisonment for two years or more is disqualified from contesting elections for six years from their release.
Landmark Supreme Court Judgments
Lily Thomas v. Union of India (2013):
The Supreme Court ruled that legislators convicted of a crime with a punishment of two years or more should be immediately disqualified, striking down the provision that allowed them to continue if they appealed within three months.
Public Interest Foundation v. Union of India (2018):
The court emphasized the need for decriminalization of politics but left it to Parliament to enact a law disqualifying candidates with pending criminal cases.
Election Commission’s Recommendations
The Election Commission of India has proposed barring candidates from contesting elections if they have serious criminal charges against them at the time of filing nominations.
Arguments in Favour of Allowing Convicted Persons to Contest Elections:
Presumption of Innocence:
The legal principle "innocent until proven guilty" is fundamental to democracy. Some argue that disqualification should apply only after all appeals are exhausted.
Political Vendetta:
In a politically charged country like India, opponents may misuse legal provisions to frame and convict rival leaders unfairly.
Right to Representation:
Preventing convicted persons from contesting elections could limit voters’ choices, especially in cases where the individual enjoys strong public support.
Judicial Delays:
Many cases take years, even decades, for final resolution. Banning individuals based on lower court rulings could be unfair if they are eventually acquitted.
Arguments Against Allowing Convicted Persons to Contest Elections:
Moral and Ethical Standards:
Leaders must be held to higher moral and ethical standards. Allowing convicted criminals to contest elections weakens democratic integrity.
Decriminalization of Politics:
India has a high number of legislators with criminal records. Barring convicted persons would reduce corruption and criminal influence in governance.
Erosion of Public Trust:
Voters lose faith in the political system when individuals with serious criminal records hold public office.
Global Democratic Norms:
Many democracies impose stricter eligibility criteria for political candidates to maintain public confidence in governance.
Challenges in Implementation:
Misuse of Laws:
Political parties may weaponize the judicial process to eliminate rivals through fabricated cases.
Delay in Electoral Reforms:
Despite recommendations from the Election Commission and Law Commission, Parliament has not enacted comprehensive electoral reforms.
Need for Fast-Track Courts:
Speedy trials for politicians facing serious charges would ensure justice while preserving electoral rights.
Significance of the Debate:
The issue of whether convicted persons should be allowed to contest elections is crucial for India's democracy.
On one hand, it involves safeguarding the constitutional right to participate in elections; on the other, it raises concerns about criminalization in politics.
While the Supreme Court has taken steps to prevent criminal elements from entering politics, the onus remains on Parliament to enact laws that balance fairness with accountability.
Electoral reforms, stricter scrutiny of candidates, and fast-tracking cases against politicians could be key solutions.
Conclusion:
The question of whether convicted individuals should be allowed to contest elections remains a contentious issue in Indian democracy.
While the legal framework disqualifies those convicted of serious crimes, gaps remain regarding candidates with pending cases.
The need for electoral reforms, judicial efficiency, and stricter eligibility criteria is essential to uphold democratic integrity.
The decision must strike a balance between protecting electoral rights and ensuring ethical governance.

**********Scientists discover Einstein ring around nearby galaxy
Why in news?
The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Euclid space telescope has discovered a rare Einstein ring around the galaxy NGC 6505, located 590 million light-years from Earth.
Captured in September 2023 and released recently, the images show a bright central galaxy encircled by a luminous ring.
Astronomers have described the find as extraordinary and lucky, highlighting its significance in Euclid’s early data.

Einstein Ring
Need to Study Einstein Rings
NGC 6505 is an
elliptical galaxy
classified as E/S0, located in the
Draco constellation
in the northern celestial hemisphere.
Draco is a constellation in the northern sky that looks like a dragon.
It's the ninth largest constellation and is visible for most of the year from the Northern Hemisphere.
It lies about 608 million light-years from the Milky Way and has a diameter of 190,000 light-years.
Discovered by Lewis A. Swift in 1884, it gained significance in 2025 when the Euclid Space Telescope detected a complete Einstein ring surrounding it.
An Einstein ring is a circular ring of light formed around a galaxy, dark matter, or a cluster of galaxies due to gravitational lensing.
Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive celestial object, like a galaxy or galaxy cluster, bends and amplifies the light from a more distant object behind it but along the same line of sight.
The object causing the light to bend is called a gravitational lens.
The Recently Discovered Einstein Ring
In the case of the Einstein ring found by ESA’s Euclid telescope, the galaxy NGC 6505 acted as the gravitational lens, distorting and magnifying the light from a distant unnamed galaxy located 4.42 billion light-years away.
Rarity and Discovery of Einstein Rings
Einstein rings were predicted by Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
The first one was discovered in 1987, and while several more have been found, their total number remains unknown.
They are
extremely rare
, with less than
1% of galaxies
having an Einstein ring.
These rings are not visible to the naked eye and can only be observed through space telescopes like
Understanding Dark Matter
– Einstein rings help study
, which makes up
85% of the universe
but cannot be directly detected. Gravitational lensing allows scientists to observe its effects.
Studying Distant Galaxies
– These rings magnify galaxies that would otherwise be invisible, providing insights into their structure and composition.
Exploring Universe Expansion
– By analyzing light from both foreground and background galaxies, Einstein rings help scientists understand how the
universe is expanding
over time.
Bridging Science with Everyday Life
- The principles of gravitational lensing have applications in medical imaging, optical lens design, and telecommunications.
Computational models used in analyzing cosmic distortions also contribute to AI, machine learning, and big data analytics, influencing diverse fields like finance, climate science, and urban planning.

**********Understanding India's Obscenity Laws
Why in news?
Ranveer Allahbadia, founder of Beer Biceps, and comedian Samay Raina are under investigation by Mumbai police for allegedly obscene comments made on the YouTube show
India’s Got Latent.
Various complaints have been filed under Section 296 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, which deals with “obscene acts.”
What’s in today’s article?
Obscenity Under Indian Law
Evolution of the Court’s Understanding of Obscenity
Obscenity in Online Content: Court Rulings
Ranveer Allahbadia controversy
Section 294: Punishment for Obscene Material
Covers
the sale, import, export, advertisement, or profit from obscene content, including books, paintings, figures, and electronic content.
Defines
obscene material as content that is lascivious, excessively sexual, or corrupting to viewers.
: Up to 2 years imprisonment and a fine of up to ₹5,000 for first-time offenders.
Obscenity in Digital Spaces: Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000
Punishes publishing or transmitting obscene material online.
Uses the same definition of obscenity as Section 294 of BNS (previously IPC Section 292).
Punishment: Up to 3 years imprisonment and a fine of up to ₹5 lakh for a first-time offence
Early Rulings and the Hicklin Test
The first major Indian case on obscenity was
Ranjit D Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra
(1964), where the Supreme Court held Lady Chatterley’s Lover to be obscene under Section 292 of the IPC.
The ruling relied on the
Hicklin test
(from Queen v. Hicklin, 1868), which defined obscenity based on whether a work had a tendency to “deprave and corrupt” those susceptible to immoral influences.
This test judged material from the perspective of the most impressionable readers, including children or those already inclined toward impure thoughts.
Shifting Standards in the UK and the US
The UK moved away from the Hicklin test with the Obscene Publications Act, 1959, requiring works to be judged “as a whole.”
The US Supreme Court in Roth v. United States (1957) introduced the community standards test, assessing whether material, taken as a whole, appealed to prurient interests based on contemporary societal norms.
India’s Shift to the Community Standards Test
The Indian Supreme Court adopted a more progressive approach in Aveek Sarkar v. State of West Bengal (2014).
It ruled that obscenity must be assessed in context, rejecting the Hicklin test’s approach of isolating specific passages.
The case involved a nude photograph of Boris Becker and his fiancée, where the court held that obscenity should be judged by evolving community standards rather than the lowest common denominator.
Supreme Court’s Ruling on College Romance
In March 2024, the Supreme Court quashed obscenity charges against the creators of the YouTube web series College Romance under Section 292 of the IPC and Section 67 of the IT Act.
The prosecution claimed the show featured vulgar language and sexually explicit discussions among college students.
The court differentiated between
profane, indecent, or foul language
ruling that obscenity must arouse sexual and lustful thoughts
, which the show did not.
Application of the Community Standards Test
The court held that while the language used was sexual in nature, it did not provoke lustful feelings in an average viewer but rather reflected emotions like anger, frustration, or excitement.
Mumbai Police have filed an FIR against YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia, comedian Samay Raina, and YouTuber Apoorva Makhija over controversial remarks made on the show India’s Got Latent.
Allahbadia’s comments allegedly demeaned the Indian family system and offended religious sentiments.
The episode featured inappropriate questions about sex and parents, sparking public outrage.
Sections under which Allahbadia and others have been booked
The YouTubers present on the show were charged under Sections 79, 196, 296, and 3(5) of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.
Section 79
– Any word or gestures intended to insult the modesty of a woman. Punishment- up to 3 years and fine.
Section 196
– addresses the promotion of enmity between different groups based on factors such as religion, race, or place of birth, carrying a penalty of up to three years of imprisonment, a fine, or both.
– deals with the public performance of obscene acts, songs, or words, with offenders facing up to three months in jail, a fine, or both.
Section 3(5)
- If more than one person carries out an act to further a common intention, all involved are liable for punishment.

**********Ensuring Integrity in Higher Education - Addressing Corruption in Accreditation
Context:
Recent arrests of senior officials, including a vice-chancellor and members of the National Accreditation and Assessment Council (
NAAC
), highlight the
deep-seated corruption in the education accreditation system
.
This raises concerns about the
credibility of educational institutions
and the
effectiveness of past reforms
in ensuring transparency.
The Evolution of Accreditation Reforms:
Over a decade ago
, transparency and accountability were introduced in the accreditation process.
Digitalization
of applications, processing, and final approvals reduced direct interactions and minimized corruption.
The system gained credibility,
yet loopholes remain
, allowing unethical practices to persist.
Challenges in Regulatory Systems:
Regulatory agencies inherently
provide opportunities for corruption
due to
discretionary powers and monopolistic controls.
The All-India Council for Technical Education (
AICTE
) was once plagued by systemic corruption.
introduced in AICTE, such as
e-governance and staff restructuring
(completely replacing employees on deputation with permanent staff, who are transferred periodically), improved accountability.
Today, the AICTE and the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) enjoy a fair degree of credibility.
Though the system is still not fool proof and securing it against corruption remains a work in progress,
other regulatory agencies could learn from AICTE’s experience
Corruption Beyond Government Institutions:
Corruption is not confined to government agencies;
private educational institutions also indulge in unethical practices.
seek higher rankings
to attract students and justify higher fees, making them willing to
manipulate the system
The government must lead the way in ensuring transparency and good governance.
Need for Further Reforms:
Technological interventions
such as digital verification and third-party audits can enhance credibility.
The proposed binary accreditation
by NAAC may simplify the process but risks ignoring qualitative aspects of education.
Mandatory document uploads
through secure platforms like
DigiLocker
can enhance transparency and accountability.
Cultural and Systemic Changes Needed:
Experts emphasized that
integrity and transparency must be ingrained as fundamental values.
Individual actions alone are insufficient;
collective action and systemic shifts
are required.
As corruption may be as old as human history, eliminating corruption completely may be unrealistic. However, stringent measures can significantly reduce its impact.
Regulatory heads and vice-chancellors must lead by example
. This could be the precursor to systemic change.
Conclusion:
The cost of corruption in education is ultimately borne by students and taxpayers.
Regulatory bodies and institutional heads must lead by example to ensure a fair and transparent accreditation system.
A corruption-free education sector is crucial for fulfilling the aspirations of a growing and
knowledge-driven society

**********Budgeting for Gender-Inclusive ‘Viksit Bharat’
Context
The
Union Budget 2025-26 underscores the government’s commitment to inclusive growth
, with a special focus on the poor, youth, farmers, and women.
This year’s budget
aims to advance India’s development under the vision of Viksit Bharat, emphasising goals such as poverty eradication, universal education
, workforce skilling, and increased female workforce participation.
Therefore,
it is important to critically examine the key gender-related provisions in the budget, their potential impact, and the challenges that remain
in achieving equitable economic participation for women in India.
Key Gender Related Provisions in the Union Budget
Increased Gender Budget Allocation
One of the most significant advancements in this year’s budget is the
rise in gender budget allocation, which now stands at 8.8% of the total budget, up from 6.8%
the previous year.
allocation of ₹4.49 lakh crore across 49 ministries reflects a holistic
, government-wide approach to gender mainstreaming.
expansion of gender budgeting into non-traditional sectors such
as railways
, shipping, and food processing
signifies a shift towards integrating gender perspectives in areas previously overlooked.
Recognition of Rising FLFPR
The budget
also recognises the rising Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR),
which increased from 33% in 2021-22 to 42% in 2023-24.
While this is a positive trend,
a considerable gap remains between male (79%) and female workforce participation.
Achieving the ambitious target of 70% women’s participation in economic activities by 2047
will require sustained investments in employment, entrepreneurship, social security
, and access to productive resources.
budget addresses these areas through increased allocations to key initiatives,
including the Skill India Programme, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), and PM Vishwakarma.
Notably, 52% of the combined ₹1.24 lakh crore allocated for these programs is directed towards women and girls,
reinforcing the government’s intent to enhance economic opportunities for women.
Gig Economy and Social Security for Women Workers
A major highlight of the budget is the
focus on gig and informal sector workers, who comprise 90% of India’s working women.
decision to issue identity cards and register gig workers on the e-Shram portal is a progressive move
that could enable millions of women to access social security entitlements and financial inclusion benefits.
Despite the gig economy offering women flexibility
and financial independence
, it is fraught with challenges such as low wages, job insecurity, and lack of maternity benefits.
Ensuring labour rights through comprehensive social security measures
, including progressive parental entitlements across both informal and formal sectors, will be crucial for safeguarding women’s economic security.
Moreover,
the establishment of a Centre of Excellence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for education, alongside a dedicated ₹600 crore
gender budget under the India AI Mission,
demonstrates the government’s intent to harness technology
for gender inclusivity.
Investing in digital education and skill development for women will be vital in bridging the gender gap in high-growth technological fields.
Acknowledgment of Women Entrepreneurs
Women-owned businesses make up 20.5% of MSMEs in India,
employing approximately 27 million people.
budget acknowledges the potential of women entrepreneurs by advocating for collateral-free loans,
alternative credit scoring models, and targeted financial literacy programs.
Reports suggest that creating 30 million additional women-owned businesses could generate up to 170 million jobs
, over 25% of the employment needed for India’s working-age population by 2030.
Thus,
policies that enhance financial access and business support for women entrepreneurs are key to economic growth.
Remaining Challenges and the Road Ahead
While the budget lays a strong foundation for gender-inclusive development,
achieving Viksit Bharat’s ambitious targets will require more than just financial allocations.
Effective policy implementation, sustained infrastructure development
, and social norm transformation are essential.
Persistent challenges such as gender pay gaps, occupational segregation, and cultural barriers limiting women’s workforce participation must be addressed
through comprehensive labour reforms and gender-sensitive workplace policies.
gender-responsive budgeting must go beyond allocations and focus on measurable outcomes.
use of gender-disaggregated data to track access and utilisation of government schemes can ensure that investments translate into tangible improvements
in women’s economic participation.
Conclusion
Union Budget 2025-26 marks a significant step towards fostering women’s economic empowerment
through increased gender-focused allocations, targeted skill development, and financial inclusion measures.
However,
the realisation of Viksit Bharat requires sustained commitment beyond budgetary provisions.
By ensuring gender-responsive governance, strengthening social protections
, and promoting equal labour market participation,
India can position women as key drivers of economic growth.

**********Nuclear Energy-Dangerous Concessions on Liability
Context
The
recent announcement in India’s Union Budget speech
regarding potential
amendments
to the
Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act has sparked significant debate.
While this move is likely to please the United States
, where successive administrations have opposed liability for nuclear suppliers,
it raises serious concerns for India’s nuclear safety.
Any attempt to indemnify nuclear manufacturers from liability
in case of an accident not only endangers public safety but also
contradicts the principles of accountability and justice.
The Problem with Nuclear Supplier Indemnity (or Insurance)
The core issue surrounding the proposed amendments is the
removal of liability for nuclear suppliers.
reactors being pushed for purchase from the United States are extremely expensive and come with inherent risks.
The 2011
Fukushima nuclear disaster
serves as a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear accidents, which impact victims, plant operators, and suppliers alike.
Historically, Indian law has upheld stringent liability norms for hazardous industries. After the
Bhopal gas tragedy
(1984), the Supreme Court established the principle of
absolute liability
, holding enterprises accountable for any harm caused.
However, the
2010 Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act
weakened this principle by channelling primary liability to the operator and
capping compensation at ₹1,500 crore.
Given that the economic damage from a nuclear disaster can reach thousands of times this amount,
such a cap is grossly insufficient.
Fukushima cleanup costs
, for instance, were estimated between
¥35 trillion and ¥80 trillion
(₹20 lakh crore to ₹46 lakh crore).
A Key Protection in India’s Nuclear Liability Laws: The Right of Recourse
Despite its flaws,
India’s nuclear liability law includes a
‘right of recourse’
clause, which allows the operator to seek compensation from the supplier if an accident results from faulty equipment or substandard services.
This provision, included due to civil society pressure, is crucial in holding suppliers accountable.
In contrast,
many Western liability regimes completely indemnify suppliers
, largely due to the influence of powerful corporations rather than safety concerns.
Evidence from past nuclear disasters reveals the role of
design flaws
in accidents. The
Mark 1 containment design
used in Fukushima was flagged as unsafe as early as 1972, yet the reactor’s designer,
General Electric (GE)
, ignored these concerns.
Similarly, after the
Three Mile Island accident
(1979), investigations found that the supplier,
Babcock & Wilcox
, had prior knowledge of potential hazards but failed to take corrective measures.
When suppliers face no liability, they lack economic incentives to ensure reactor safety
post-sale.
Fallacy of U.S. Reactor Imports
Political Pressures and Corporate Influence
Nuclear suppliers have
consistently resisted any liability obligations in India.
United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government initially attempted to weaken the right of recourse
, leading to criticism from political leaders, including Arun Jaitley.
However, after coming to power, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government adopted a similar stance
, downplaying the right of recourse and suggesting that liability could be bypassed through contractual arrangements.
Aggressive Lobbying by US to Amend India’s Nuclear Liability Law
United States has actively lobbied for amendments to India’s nuclear liability law.
Eric Garcetti, the outgoing U.S. Ambassador to India, confirmed discussions with Indian political leaders
to push for changes that favour U.S. nuclear suppliers.
insistence on indemnity reflects fears that a future Indian government might increase the liability cap
, exposing corporations to significant financial risks.
If
supplier liability is enforced in India, it could also set a precedent in other countries,
disrupting the established corporate protection enjoyed by U.S. nuclear firms.
The Economic Concerns
Beyond liability concerns,
the economic rationale for purchasing U.S. nuclear reactors is questionable.
The leading
AP1000 reactor
, manufactured by
Westinghouse
, has encountered severe cost overruns and construction delays.
In the U.S., two AP1000 reactors in
South Carolina
were abandoned after $9 billion had been spent, while two others in
Georgia
were completed at an astronomical cost of $36.8 billion, more than
250% over budget
High construction costs translate to expensive electricity, making nuclear power uncompetitive against renewable sources.
2013 study in the Economic & Political Weekly
showed that even with India’s lower labour costs, electricity from these reactors would remain disproportionately expensive.
The newer
small modular reactor (SMR)
designs, touted as a solution, suffer from the
loss of economies of scale
, making them even less viable.
Hollow Safety Claims
liability debate also exposes the contradictions in supplier safety claims.
Companies like Westinghouse argue
that a radiation
release from an AP1000 reactor would occur only once in 50 million years.
However, if the technology is so safe, why do these corporations insist on complete indemnity?
Their unwillingness to accept liability suggests they recognise the real risks of accidents
, yet expect Indian citizens to bear those risks without adequate protection.
Conclusion
India’s nuclear liability law is crucial for protecting public safety
and ensuring accountability.
Weakening supplier liability
would not only endanger citizens
but also shift financial burdens to taxpayers in the event of a nuclear disaster.
The Indian government must resist external pressure
and prioritise national interests over corporate profits.
A strong nuclear liability framework is not just a legal necessity but a fundamental safeguard
for the country’s future.

Today’s editorial talks about the
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act.
This content will help in GS papers 2 and 3 in mains answer writing.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
The mention of plans to amend the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act in the Union Budget is a serious issue that needs attention.
What is the Atomic Energy Act?
Atomic Energy Act, 1962
is an Indian law that regulates the development, production, and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes while ensuring national security. It gives the government
exclusive control over nuclear materials, plants, and research
and allows the establishment of nuclear power projects. The Act also covers
radiation safety, uranium mining, reactor operations, and waste disposal
to prevent misuse and ensure public safety.
What is the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act?
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, 2010
is an Indian law that defines liability in case of a nuclear accident. It ensures compensation for victims while holding nuclear plant operators accountable.
Key Features:
Operator Liability:
The primary financial responsibility for any nuclear accident rests with the plant operator (NPCIL in India), not the supplier.
Right of Recourse:
Unlike many other countries, India allows operators to seek compensation from suppliers if defective equipment or services cause an accident (Section 17).
Liability Cap:
Operator liability is capped at ₹1,500 crore (~$180 million), with the government covering additional costs if needed.
Exclusion from Global Regimes:
India has not joined international nuclear liability agreements like the
Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC)
, meaning financial responsibility remains domestic.
What are the safety and liability concerns related to nuclear energy?
Risk of Catastrophic Accidents:
Nuclear plant failures can lead to massive radiation leaks, environmental destruction, and long-term health impacts.
Example
: The
Fukushima Daiichi disaster (2011, Japan)
resulted from a tsunami, causing multiple reactor meltdowns and widespread radioactive contamination.
Design Flaws and Negligence:
Suppliers may overlook or downplay safety risks in reactor designs, leading to vulnerabilities.
Three Mile Island accident (1979, USA)
occurred due to a known reactor design flaw that the supplier failed to address.
Limited Liability for Suppliers:
In many countries, nuclear suppliers are indemnified, placing financial liability entirely on plant operators and governments.
General Electric (GE)
, which designed the Fukushima reactors, faced no financial consequences due to Japan’s liability laws.
Insufficient Compensation for Victims:
Liability caps limit compensation for victims, despite the high costs of nuclear disasters.
: India’s
caps liability at ₹1,500 crore, whereas Fukushima’s cleanup costs are estimated at ₹20-46 lakh crore.
Radioactive Waste and Long-Term Risks:
Safe disposal of nuclear waste remains a major challenge, with risks of leaks and contamination lasting thousands of years.
Chernobyl disaster (1986, USSR)
left a radioactive exclusion zone that remains uninhabitable nearly 40 years later.
How does India’s approach to nuclear liability differ from global standards?
Operator Liability with Limited Supplier Responsibility:
, places
primary liability on the operator (NPCIL)
, but allows it to seek compensation from suppliers in case of defective equipment or services (
Right of Recourse, Section 17
Global Standard
: Most countries
fully indemnify suppliers
, meaning they bear no financial responsibility after supplying reactors.
faced no liability for the
Fukushima disaster (2011)
, while in
India, foreign suppliers fear financial risks
if an accident occurs.
Liability Cap vs. Unlimited Liability in Some Countries:
caps operator liability at ₹1,500 crore (~$180 million)
, with additional compensation coming from the government if needed.
: Some countries, like
Germany
, impose
unlimited liability
on operators to ensure full compensation. The
U.S. Price-Anderson Act
establishes a large industry-backed fund for damages beyond a certain limit.
: After the
, the Soviet government bore the entire cost (~$235 billion), whereas an
Indian accident beyond ₹1,500 crore would shift the financial burden to taxpayers
India is Not Part of Global Nuclear Liability Regimes:
not signed the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC)
, which standardizes liability norms and creates an international compensation pool.
: Most nuclear-powered nations, including
the U.S. and Japan, are CSC members
, ensuring global financial support for nuclear accidents.
: If a
nuclear accident occurs in France
, CSC members contribute to compensation, but in India,
all financial burdens remain domestic
What are the reasons behind the government’s plan to amend the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act?
Attracting Foreign Investment and Suppliers
– The existing
CLND Act
allows India’s nuclear operator (NPCIL) to seek compensation from foreign suppliers in case of faulty equipment, discouraging companies from supplying reactors. Amendments could
limit supplier liability
, making India a more attractive market for nuclear investments from countries like the
U.S., France, and Russia
Expanding Nuclear Energy Capacity
– India aims to
increase its nuclear power generation
to meet rising energy demands and climate goals. Simplifying liability laws could
accelerate agreements with international partners
and facilitate the construction of new nuclear plants under deals such as the
India-U.S. Civil Nuclear Agreement
What are the other implications of increasing nuclear energy reliance?
High Economic Costs and Project Delays:
Nuclear power plants require
massive upfront investments, long construction periods, and frequent cost overruns
AP1000 reactors in Georgia, USA
, were initially estimated at
$14 billion
but were completed at
$36.8 billion
—a
250% cost overrun
. Similarly, India’s
Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant
significant delays and cost escalations
Nuclear Waste Management and Environmental Risks:
Nuclear energy produces
radioactive waste
that remains hazardous for thousands of years, requiring secure disposal and long-term monitoring.
led to the release of radioactive material, contaminating land and water, with cleanup costs estimated between
¥35-80 trillion (~₹20-46 lakh crore)
. India
lacks permanent storage facilities
for high-level nuclear waste.
Geopolitical and Security Concerns:
Expanding nuclear energy means
higher dependence on foreign suppliers
strategic vulnerabilities and potential external influence
civil nuclear deal with the U.S. (2008)
opened doors for technology transfer, but suppliers now demand
liability protection
before delivering reactors,
creating diplomatic pressure
Way forward:
Strengthen Liability and Safety Frameworks:
The government should Amend the
to ensure fair risk-sharing between operators and suppliers.
Need to invest in
advanced reactor safety technologies
(e.g., Small Modular Reactors – SMRs) and strengthen
independent regulatory oversight
Develop Robust Waste Management and Indigenous Capabilities:
The government should establish
permanent disposal sites
for high-level nuclear waste with stringent monitoring.
Need to enhance
domestic nuclear technology

**********Should convicted persons contest elections?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to election; RPA, 1951;
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court is reviewing petitions by Ashwin Upadhyay and others, asking for a lifetime ban on convicted people from contesting elections.
What does the RPA, 1951 stipulate with respect to electoral candidates convicted of criminal offences?
Section 8(3):
Disqualifies a person convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to at least two years of imprisonment. The disqualification extends for six years after their release.
Section 8(1):
Provides for automatic disqualification for convictions under specific laws (e.g., IPC for heinous crimes like rape, Prevention of Corruption Act, UAPA) regardless of sentence length, plus six years after release.
Section 8(4) (Struck Down in 2013):
Previously allowed sitting legislators to continue in office despite conviction if they appealed—declared unconstitutional in
Lily Thomas (2013)
Section 11:
Empowers the Election Commission (EC) to remove or reduce the period of disqualification. Used controversially in 2019 to allow Prem Singh Tamang to contest elections.
What are the various judgments of the SC which favour the decriminalisation of politics?
Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) case (2002):
Mandated the disclosure of criminal records by all candidates.
CEC vs. Jan Chaukidar case (2013):
Upheld that individuals in jail cease to be ‘electors’ and are therefore not qualified to contest elections. However, this was overturned by a parliamentary amendment in 2013, allowing under-trial prisoners to contest elections.
Lily Thomas (2013):
Struck down Section 8(4) of the RP Act, 1951, thereby disqualifying sitting legislators immediately upon conviction.
What is the case for a lifetime ban on convicted individuals standing for office?
Upholding Integrity & Public Trust:
Lawmakers must adhere to the highest ethical standards as they create and enforce laws.
Example:
The Lily Thomas (2013) judgment disqualified convicted legislators immediately, reinforcing the need for clean governance.
Parity with Government Jobs:
A convicted person is ineligible for even a
junior government job
, yet they can contest elections after six years.
A person convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act cannot work in government but can become an MP/MLA.
Curbing Criminalisation of Politics: 46% of MPs in 2024
have criminal cases, and
31% face serious charges
like rape, murder, and kidnapping.
Mohammad Shahabuddin, a former MP from Bihar, had multiple murder cases but was elected to office multiple times.
Judicial & Expert Recommendations:
Supreme Court, Law Commission (1999, 2014), and Election Commission
have all recommended stricter disqualification norms.
The Law Commission recommended barring individuals from contesting elections once
charges are framed for serious offences
Strengthening Democracy & Rule of Law:
A lifetime ban for heinous crimes and corruption would prevent criminals from misusing political power.
Lalu Prasad Yadav was convicted in the
fodder scam
but continued to influence politics despite being disqualified.
Should convicted persons be allowed to contest elections?
Arguments in Favour:
Rehabilitation & Second Chance:
A convict who has served their sentence should not be permanently barred from participating in democracy.
Nelson Mandela was convicted and imprisoned for 27 years but later became South Africa’s President, leading the country to democracy.
Potential for Political Misuse:
Opponents may misuse legal provisions by filing false cases to prevent strong candidates from contesting elections.
Political leaders in India, like Arvind Kejriwal, have faced multiple cases, some of which were later dismissed as politically motivated.
Disproportionate Punishment:
Not all convictions involve moral turpitude or crimes against society. A blanket ban would be excessive in certain cases.
A person convicted for
protesting against an unjust law
(civil disobedience) should not be equated with someone convicted of
corruption or murder
Arguments Against:
Ensuring Clean Politics:
Public representatives should maintain high ethical standards, and allowing convicts to contest elections erodes trust in governance.
Mohammad Shahabuddin, a convicted criminal, was elected multiple times despite serious charges, highlighting flaws in the system.
If convicted individuals are ineligible for government employment, they should also be barred from lawmaking positions.
cannot hold a bureaucratic post but can become an MP or MLA, which is inconsistent.
Threat to Democratic Institutions:
Criminally convicted politicians can misuse their power to influence investigations, intimidate witnesses, and weaken democratic institutions.
Politicians with serious criminal cases often manipulate legal loopholes and delay proceedings to continue contesting elections.
Way forward:
Stricter Disqualification Norms:
Implement a
on candidates convicted of heinous crimes (murder, rape, corruption) while allowing judicial review for politically motivated cases. Strengthen laws to
bar individuals from contesting elections once charges are framed
for serious offences, as recommended by the Law Commission.
Electoral & Judicial Reforms:
Fast-track trials of politicians facing criminal cases through
special courts
, ensuring timely justice. Strengthen the
Election Commission’s authority

**********No fundamental right to reservation, but State can’t deny it without valid reasoning: SC
SC Judgements
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Reservation in India; Fundamental Right;
Why in the News?
Recently, the Supreme Court stated that reservation is not a fundamental right. Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) of the Constitution allow the government to provide reservations, but they do not make it mandatory. However, if the government decides not to give reservations, it must have valid reasons and supporting data to justify its decision.
What is the legal status of reservation in India?
Constitutional provisions:
Article 15(4)
allows the state to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes, Scheduled Castes (SCs), and Scheduled Tribes (STs).
Article 16(4)
enables the State and Central Governments to reserve seats in government services for SCs and STs.
Article 16(4A),
introduced via the 77th Constitutional Amendment in 1995, empowers the government to provide reservations in promotions for SCs and STs if they are not adequately represented in public services. This was later modified by the 85th Amendment in 2001 to include consequential seniority.
Article 338B
gives constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC).
Article 342A
empowers the President to notify the list of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) for any state or union territory, which can only be amended by Parliament.
Article 46
states that the State shall promote the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections, particularly SCs and STs, and protect them from social injustice and exploitation.
Judicial precedence:
Champakam Dorairajan vs. State of Madras (1951):
The Supreme Court ruled against communal reservations, leading to the First Constitutional Amendment, which introduced Article 15(4).
Indra Sawhney vs. Union of India (1992):
The Supreme Court capped caste-based reservations at 50%, ruling that reservations should not destroy the concept of equality. It also mandated the exclusion of the “creamy layer” among Other Backward Classes (OBCs) from reservation benefits and stated that there should not be reservation in promotions.
M. Nagaraj v. Union of India (2006):
The Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Article 16(4A) but stated that any reservation policy must ensure the SC/ST community is socially and educationally backward, not adequately represented in public employment, and that such policy shall not affect the overall efficiency in the administration.
Janhit Abhiyan vs Union Of India (2022):
The Supreme Court upheld the 103rd Constitutional Amendment, which introduced 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) from unreserved classes, even if it exceeds the 50% limit on total reservations.
Under what conditions can the state deny or grant reservations?
Based on Quantifiable Data:
The State must collect
quantifiable data
to assess the
underrepresentation
of backward classes before granting reservations.
Example:
required the government to prove inadequate representation before providing reservations in promotions.
No Arbitrary Decisions:
Reservations cannot be
granted or denied arbitrarily
and they must be backed by
valid reasoning and legal justification
The Supreme Court ruled in
State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas (1976)
that reservation policies should be rational and not violate the right to equality.
Transparency in Public Employment:
The government must clearly
specify reservation details
(total posts, reserved/unreserved categories) in job advertisements. If
no reservation is provided, it must be justified
The Supreme Court struck down a
2010 recruitment process in Palamu, Jharkhand
for failing to mention reservation details, deeming it non-transparent.
How does the Supreme Court balance reservation with equality and fairness?
Reservations Are Enabling, Not Mandatory:
The Court clarifies that
Articles 16(4) and 16(4-A) are enabling provisions
, meaning the State may grant reservations but is not obligated to do so.
Ensuring No Arbitrary Decisions:
The State must base its decision on
regarding underrepresentation. Arbitrary refusal or granting of reservations is unconstitutional.
50% Ceiling on Reservations:
As per the
judgment (1992), reservations should
not exceed 50%
, ensuring fair opportunities for all, unless exceptional circumstances justify exceeding the limit.
Merit and Social Justice Balance:
The Court emphasizes that reservation should uplift disadvantaged groups
without compromising meritocracy
in public employment and education.
Judicial Scrutiny to Prevent Abuse:
Courts can strike down reservation policies if they are found to be politically motivated,
lacking empirical justification
, or violating
Articles 14 and 16 (equality in public employment).
Way forward:
Data-Driven Reservation Policies:
The government should ensure periodic
empirical assessment of backwardness and representation
to justify reservations, preventing misuse and ensuring targeted benefits.
Balancing Merit and Affirmative Action:
Strengthen
skill development, education, and economic empowerment
programs to reduce long-term reliance on reservations while ensuring fair representation in public employment and education.

**********Doctrine of Pith and Substance
SC Judgements
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court has
reaffirmed the
, holding that the
Centre cannot impose service tax on lottery distributors
as the power to tax lotteries falls
exclusively within the jurisdiction of state governments
.
Why did the Supreme Court dismiss the Centre’s Plea?
Lotteries Are Not a Service but Gambling
: The court ruled that the relationship between states and lottery distributors is
buyer-seller
, not
principal-agent
, making
service tax inapplicable
Exclusive Taxing Power of States:
The Constitution grants
state legislatures
the authority to
tax betting and gambling, including lotteries
Parliament
cannot override this through residuary powers (Entry 97 – List I)
as taxation on lotteries is already covered under
Entry 62 – List II
Doctrine of Pith and Substance Applied:
dominant nature of lotteries is gambling
, even if
marketing and promotion involve service elements
Since the
primary focus
remains within the
State List
Centre cannot impose service tax on it
Sikkim High Court Ruling Upheld:
The SC upheld the
2012 Sikkim HC decision
, which declared
Section 65(105) of the Finance Act, 1994 (as amended in 2010)
unconstitutional, as it attempted to impose service tax on lottery-related activities.
What is Doctrine of Pith and Substance?
helps determine whether a
law’s dominant purpose falls within the legislative competence of the enacting government
Key Features:
Examines the true nature
of a law, rather than incidental overlaps.
Resolves Centre-State conflicts
over legislative powers.
Allows minor encroachments
if the primary subject falls within the legislature’s authority.
Major Supreme Court Cases Applying the Doctrine:
State of Bombay v. FN Balsara (1951):
Upheld a
state alcohol prohibition law
, despite minor overlaps with Union subjects.
Prafulla Kumar Mukherjee v. Bank of Commerce (1947):
Allowed
incidental encroachment
as long as the law’s primary focus was within its jurisdiction.
Application in Lottery Taxation Case:
Centre’s argument for taxing lotteries
under Entry 97 – List I
was rejected
dominant purpose of lottery transactions is gambling
states exclusively regulate and tax
