Tardigrades
A team of researchers has identified the genetic mechanisms that help a newly discovered species of tardigrades (Hypsibius henanensis) withstand high levels of radiation.
About Tardigrades:
These are known as
water bears or moss piglets,
tardigrades have long fascinated scientists as they can
withstand extreme conditions.
They are free-living tiny invertebrates belonging to the
phylum Tardigrada.
Around 1,300 species of tardigrades are found worldwide.
Habitat:
considered aquatic
because they require a thin layer of water around their bodies to prevent dehydration, they’ve also been observed in all kinds of environments, from the deep sea to sand dunes.
Freshwater mosses and lichens are their preferred habitat, hence their nickname, moss piglet.
Researchers found
three factors
that help this
species survive radiation.
It has ability to quickly repair double-strand breaks in DNA due to radiation exposure, by using a
protein called TRID1.
The second factor involved a gene that was switched on during exposure to radiation, resulting in the generation of two proteins that are known to be important for mitochondrial synthesis of ATP—in tardigrades, it appears they also help with DNA repair.
It has ability to minimize damage from radiation by producing a large number of proteins that serve
as effective antioxidants
—they clear out free radicals before they can cause problems in the creature's cells.
Significance:
The findings could one day be harnessed to help protect astronauts from radiation during
space missions, clean up nuclear pollution
or improve cancer treatment, according to a report in Nature.

**********Kittur Rani Channamma
On the 200th anniversary of Kittur Vijayotsava a commemorative Postage stamp was released at the historic Kittur Rani Channamma Stage, Kittur Fort Premises.
About Kittur Rani Channamma:
She was born in Kakati, a small village in today’s
Belagavi district of Karnataka.
She became queen of Kitturu (now in Karnataka) when she married
Raja Mallasarja of the Desai family.
After Mallasarja’s death in 1816, his eldest son, Shivalingarudra Sarja, ascended the throne.
Before his death in 1824, Shivalingarudra adopted a child,
Shivalingappa
, as the successor.
However, the British East India Company
refused to recognise Shivalingappa as the successor
of the kingdom under the ‘
doctrine of lapse’.
Key facts about the Kittur Rebellion
John Thackery, the British official at Dharwad, launched an attack on
Kittur in October 1824.
In this first battle British forces lost heavily and the Collector and political agent, St. John Thackeray was killed by the Kitturu forces.
Two British officers,
Sir Walter Elliot and Mr. Stevenson
, were also taken as hostages.
However, the British army again attacked the Kittur Fort and captured it.
Rani Chennamma and her family were imprisoned and jailed at the fort in Bailhongal, where she died in 1829.

**********Coral Triangle
A report released at the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) highlighted alarming facts about oil and gas activities in the Coral Triangle.
About Coral Triangle:
The Coral Triangle, often referred to as the
‘Amazon of the seas’,
is a huge marine area spanning over 10 million square kilometres.
It includes countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, and the Solomon Islands.
Significance:
This region is home to
76 per cent of the world’s coral species
and supports more than 120 million people who rely on its resources for their livelihoods.
Threats:
Unsustainable
fishing practices, pollution from coastal development
, and climate change-induced coral bleaching pose significant risks to the health and resilience of these ecosystems.
What are Corals?
Corals are essentially animals, which are sessile, meaning they
permanently attach themselves to the ocean floor.
Corals share a
symbiotic relationship
with single-celled algae
called zooxanthellae.
The algae provide the coral with food and nutrients, which they make through photosynthesis, using the sun’s light.
They use their tiny tentacle-like hands to catch food from the water and sweep into their mouth.
Each individual
coral animal is known as a polyp
and it lives in groups of hundreds to thousands of genetically identical polyps that form a ‘colony’.

**********Reforming Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)
Why in News?
The G20 Independent Expert Group has issued a report card assessing the progress made by Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in expanding lending capacity and mobilising private capital.
This assessment highlights
the gap between current achievements and the ambitious "triple agenda"
needed to meet global development and sustainability goals.
The expert group had been set up under the G20 Indian Presidency and had Fifteenth Finance Commission Chairman NK Singh and former US Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers as co-convenors.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What are Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)?
Why is Reforming MDBs Essential?
Key Recommendations for MDB Reforms
Way Ahead to Strengthen MDBs
Conclusion
MDBs are financial institutions
providing loans, grants, and technical assistance to foster economic and social development in low- and middle-income countries.
These include
the World Bank Group, Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, etc.
MDBs have been pivotal in addressing poverty,
building infrastructure, and enhancing human capital across developing nations.
However, evolving global needs now call for reforming MDBs to better support countries in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth.
Outdated legal and institutional framework:
The current frameworks of MDBs,
established post-World War II for reconstruction
, no longer align with the digital age's complexities and challenges.
They
do not fully reflect the current realities
and aspirations of developing nations, particularly those in the
Global South.
Limited private financing engagement:
MDBs were urged to mobilise $740 billion annually in private financing to meet climate and sustainable development goals (SDGs).
However, current private sector involvement falls short, with MDBs securing only about $70 billion in private capital in the past year.
Limited local currency lending:
While MDBs have expanded guarantees and risk mitigation tools, local currency lending remains underdeveloped, with few successful examples to date.
Key Recommendations for MDB Reforms:
Triple mandate for MDBs:
Eliminating extreme poverty.
Promoting inclusive growth.
Financing global public goods
with an emphasis on sustainable development and climate goals.
How to meet this triple mandate?
MDBs were advised to triple their financial commitments, establish a "Global Challenges Funding" mechanism, and significantly boost private sector engagement.
Expanding lending capacity:
MDBs have made strides in expanding their lending capacities:
A 33% increase in lending capacity.
Improved use of balance sheets and guarantee platforms.
Reforms to the capital adequacy framework to optimise resources.
Despite this progress, MDBs are still short of the targeted tripling in capacity required to fulfil their expanded mandate.
Innovations in capital mobilisation:
MDBs introduced innovative funding mechanisms
, including hybrid capital options (non-voting shares) to attract additional financing.
Although some member states showed interest, uptake has been limited.
Private sector involvement:
There is the need to change the MDB cultures
to lower perceived risks for private capital
Involving private investors, working with rating agencies, and creating an atmosphere that is conducive to investment is the need of the hour.
Way Ahead to Strengthen MDBs:
Enhancing performance and relevance:
Current approaches do not maximise MDBs' potential to mobilise resources, foster policy alignment, and support innovation.
Tailored, flexible solutions and diversified instruments
are crucial for the dynamic needs of different countries and sectors.
Improving governance:
MDBs' governance structures are often seen as
unrepresentative of developing countries
Increased transparency, accountability, and responsiveness
are essential to MDBs’ credibility and effectiveness.
Concessional financing:
For the world’s poorest countries.
Climate-related financing:
MDBs have substantially increased climate financing, with commitments reaching $75 billion in 2023 - up from $42 billion in 2019. This includes $50 billion for mitigation and $25 billion for adaptation activities.
Coordination among MDBs:
MDBs are working to harmonise procurement practices and have introduced a digital co-financing portal to facilitate large-scale project coordination.
Conclusion:
The G20 report card underscores both achievements and gaps in MDB reforms.
While MDBs have enhanced lending capacity and introduced measures for better private sector engagement, significant efforts are still required to meet the ambitious goals of the “triple agenda.”
With a strong role to play,
India’s leadership and commitment to MDB reforms
could help shape a more inclusive, responsive, and effective MDB system for the Global South.

**********The rise and fall of P2P lending in India
Why in news?
In August 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed strict rules on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms. As a result, the industry’s asset under management (AUM) plummeted by 35% — from an estimated ₹10,000 crore to ₹6,500 crore.
The main purpose of P2P platforms is to connect lenders and borrowers, without being directly involved in the loans themselves. There are mixed views on whether P2P platforms can adapt to the changes imposed by RBI. This article explores the sector’s past, present, and possible future.
What’s in today’s article?
Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending
Regulation by RBI
The Uncertain Future of P2P Lending in India
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending
About
P2P lending is a method of lending money directly to individuals or businesses without a financial institution as an intermediary.
This typically occurs through online platforms that connect lenders with borrowers.
While P2P loans can be either secured or unsecured, most are unsecured personal loans, with secured loans—usually backed by luxury items—being rare.
P2P lending is valued as an alternative financing option due to its distinct characteristics.
Working
Borrower Application
: A borrower submits an application on a P2P platform.
Risk Assessment
: The platform evaluates the borrower's creditworthiness, assigns a risk rating, and sets an interest rate.
Investor Matching
: Upon approval, the borrower receives loan offers from investors based on their rating and interest rate.
Selection
: The borrower reviews options and selects a suitable offer.
Repayment
: The borrower makes regular interest payments and repays the principal at the loan’s maturity.
Platform Fees
: The platform charges fees to both borrowers and lenders for its services.
Advantages
Higher Returns
: P2P lending generally offers investors higher returns than traditional investments.
Accessible Funding
: It provides a funding option for borrowers who may not qualify for traditional bank loans.
Lower Interest Rates
: Due to increased competition and lower fees, P2P loans often feature reduced interest rates.
Disadvantages of Peer-to-Peer Lending
Credit Risk
: P2P loans carry a higher risk of default since many borrowers have low credit ratings.
No Government Protection
: Lenders are not insured or protected by government guarantees.
Regulatory Limitations
: Some regions restrict or heavily regulate P2P lending, limiting access for certain borrowers and investors.
Extra charges
– Borrowers might encounter additional charges beyond the loan’s interest rate, which can potentially raise the cost of borrowing.
Early Discussions on Regulating P2P Lending
In 2016, RBI began considering regulations for P2P lending to address informal money-lending practices.
With global growth in P2P lending and new platforms emerging in India, the RBI released a discussion paper on whether regulation was needed.
Concerns included potentially legitimizing P2P lending by regulating it, stifling its growth, and the sector's limited impact on the financial system at the time.
After consulting stakeholders, the RBI issued guidelines in 2017 that outlined activities for lenders, set eligibility criteria, and mandated transparency on fees and pricing.
Regulatory Concerns and Clampdown
P2P platforms started behaving like banks by profiting from the difference between borrower interest rates and lender earnings
This led the RBI to intervene, banning practices such as using one lender's funds to replace another's, thus shutting down the secondary market.
The RBI's regulations mainly targeted popular features like guaranteed returns based on investment terms and easy withdrawal options, and also required a faster settlement process (T+1).
The RBI also required full fee disclosure and prohibited closed-group matching of lenders and borrowers.
The outlook for P2P lending in India remains unclear.
A major P2P platform recently halted new customer registrations, resulting in a 30-35% drop in assets under management (AUM).
AUM is the total market value of investments that a financial institution, fund manager, or entity manages on behalf of its clients.
The RBI has been inspecting platforms for compliance, and if secondary market options remain restricted, volumes may decline significantly.
Some large platforms are even considering relinquishing their licenses.

Sustainable production;
Why in the News?
India’s Anusandhan National Research Foundation and the BioE3 policy promote academia-industry collaboration, driving the bioeconomy for economic growth, sustainability, and climate action commitment.
What is BioE3 policy?
The BioE3 policy aims to transform chemical industries into sustainable bio-based models, promoting biotechnology to drive economic growth, protect the environment, and create jobs, supporting India’s sustainable development and climate goals.
Primary Environmental impacts associated with FMCG production and consumption:
Resource Depletion
: The production of FMCGs often requires significant natural resources, such as water, energy, and raw materials. For example, palm oil, widely used in food and personal care products, leads to deforestation when forests are cleared for plantations.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
: The manufacturing and distribution of FMCGs contribute to greenhouse gas emissions at multiple stages, from sourcing raw materials to production processes and transportation.
Waste Generation
: FMCGs, especially those with single-use packaging (e.g., plastics), generate a considerable amount of waste, which ends up in landfills or the ocean, causing environmental pollution.
Water Pollution
: The production and use of FMCGs, such as soaps, detergents, and other chemicals, can lead to water pollution through the discharge of untreated wastewater containing harmful substances.
Loss of Biodiversity
: The agricultural practices used to source raw materials like palm oil can lead to habitat destruction, thereby threatening biodiversity. Monoculture farming and deforestation disrupt ecosystems and endanger wildlife.
How can FMCG companies implement sustainable practices across their supply chains?
Companies should
adopt responsible sourcing policies
, such as using certified sustainable palm oil and other raw materials that adhere to ‘No Deforestation, No Peat’ policies.
Implementing energy-efficient processes, switching to renewable energy sources, and optimizing logistics to reduce emissions can
minimize the carbon footprint
across the supply chain.
Emphasizing recycling, reusing materials, and developing biodegradable or compostable packaging can help
reduce waste and resource depletion
The integration of
bio-based or synthetic alternatives
to traditional materials can also be beneficial.
Companies should implement measures to reduce water usage in manufacturing and treat wastewater
to prevent water pollution
Working with smallholder farmers to implement regenerative agricultural practices can help restore soil health, improve biodiversity, and support sustainable livelihoods.
What metrics should be used to measure the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives in FMCGs?
Carbon Footprint Reduction
: Tracking greenhouse gas emissions across the supply chain and setting targets for reducing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.
Sustainable Sourcing Percentage
: Measuring the proportion of raw materials sourced sustainably, such as certified palm oil or recycled materials.
Waste Reduction and Recycling Rates
: Monitoring the volume of waste generated, the amount sent to landfills, and the recycling rate of packaging materials.
Water Usage and Pollution Levels
: Tracking water consumption in production and measuring the quality of wastewater discharged to ensure compliance with environmental standards.
Biodiversity Impact
: Assessing the effect of sourcing practices on ecosystems and tracking initiatives to protect or restore biodiversity.
Product Sustainability Index
: Developing a sustainability index for products that takes into account their entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal.
Way forward:
Strengthen Collaboration and Innovation:
Foster partnerships between academia, industry, and government to drive research and development of sustainable alternatives to traditional materials, such as palm oil, and implement innovative practices throughout the FMCG supply chain.
Implement Comprehensive Sustainability Frameworks:
Establish regulatory frameworks that incentivize sustainable practices, including mandatory reporting on sustainability metrics, eco-labelling for products, and support for circular economy initiatives to minimize waste and resource depletion.
**********SC rules that Aadhaar cannot be used as proof of date of birth
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Supreme court role;
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar cards cannot be accepted as proof of age, as other official documents like the School Leaving Certificate are more appropriate for this purpose.
What are the legal implications of the SC’s ruling on Aadhaar as proof of date of birth?
The ruling reinforces the legal stance that Aadhaar is primarily intended for identity verification rather than as a document for verifying age or date of birth. This aligns with the previous Supreme Court judgment in 2018, which defined Aadhaar as “
proof of identity”
rather than proof of age or residence.
By citing the
Juvenile Justice Act
and previous HC judgments, the SC emphasized that statutory provisions and established legal precedents should guide the determination of age.
consistency
ensures that legal processes are not diluted by using documents like Aadhaar, which lack stringent verification for date of birth.
The ruling adheres to
UIDAI’s own circular
, which states that Aadhaar is not intended to serve as proof of date of birth. This reduces potential misuse or misinterpretation of the Aadhaar card’s scope and usage.
How will this decision impact individuals and agencies that utilize Aadhaar for identity verification?
Impact on Identity Verification Practices
: While Aadhaar remains a valid document for identity verification, organizations and institutions will need to reassess the supporting documents they accept for age-related verification.
For instance, banks, insurance companies, and government agencies may need to request additional documents when the date of birth is a critical factor.
Review of Policies in Government Schemes
: Agencies implementing government schemes may need to revise their processes to comply with this ruling, ensuring that alternative documents are requested for verifying age-related eligibility.
Impact on Legal and Compensation Cases
: In cases where age is a factor in calculating benefits, legal entities must rely on more reliable documents, such as birth certificates or school records, instead of Aadhaar.
What alternative documents can be used for verifying the DoB following this ruling?
School Leaving Certificate/Matriculation Certificate
: This is often considered the most reliable document for verifying the age of an individual, as it is issued based on records from the time of schooling.
Birth Certificate
: The birth certificate remains the primary document for establishing a person’s date of birth as it is issued by a government authority at the time of birth.
Passport
: As an official government document that undergoes strict verification, the passport can serve as valid proof of age.
Government-issued Certificates (e.g., PAN Card)
: While not always requested for age verification, documents like the PAN card can also be used in some cases where other primary documents are unavailable.
Driver’s License or Voter ID (if Date of Birth is Mentioned)
: These documents, where the date of birth is explicitly recorded, could be used as supporting evidence for age verification.
Way forward:
Strengthen Guidelines for Acceptable Age Verification Documents
: Government agencies, financial institutions, and service providers should clearly outline which documents are accepted for age verification, prioritizing reliable records like birth certificates and school certificates to ensure consistency and compliance.
Enhance Public Awareness on Aadhaar’s Usage Limitations
: The government should initiate campaigns to educate citizens about Aadhaar’s limitations as age proof and encourage the use of appropriate documents for age-related matters, reducing confusion and potential legal disputes.
Mains PYQ:
Two parallel run schemes of the Government, viz the Adhar card and NPM, one of voluntary and the other as compulsory, have led to debates at national levels and also litigations.

Supreme Court Ruling on Minority on June 2023:
Violation of Equal Protection:
The Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling declared Harvard and UNC’s (University of North Carolina) race-based admissions
unconstitutional
, citing violations of the Equal Protection Clause and racial stereotyping.
Minority Representation:
The decision is likely to decrease African-American enrollment at top universities while benefiting Asian-American admissions, raising concerns about equity.
The ruling could extend beyond higher education, affecting K-12 schooling and race-related employment practices under Title VII.
K-12 education
refers to the comprehensive educational system that spans from kindergarten (K) through 12th grade. This structure is designed to provide a standardized framework for formal education, primarily in the United States, Canada, and several other countries.
What are the implications of the SC’s ruling on affirmative action for Minority Groups?
Shift in Demographics
: The Supreme Court’s ruling, which prohibits race-based considerations in college admissions, has resulted in a significant decrease in African-American representation at prestigious universities while benefiting Asian-American admissions.
Heightened Tensions
: The ruling exacerbates existing tensions between different minority groups, particularly between African Americans and Asian-Americans, as the latter may perceive an advantage in admissions due to the ruling, creating conflict over perceived equity in opportunities.
Reevaluation of Policies
: Minority groups may need to reassess their strategies for achieving representation and equity in educational and professional fields in light of changing admission policies and their implications on access.
How do intersectional conflicts among minority groups manifest in contemporary politics?
Competing Interests
: Conflicts arise when minority groups, such as African-Americans and Asian-Americans, have differing views on policies like affirmative action, leading to a fragmented approach to addressing discrimination and inequality.
Political Polarization
: Issues like immigration and welfare policies create further divisions, as different groups may align with political parties based on how they perceive their interests are being served or threatened.
Influence on Electoral Dynamics
: The intersections of race, ethnicity, and social issues complicate the electoral landscape, as political candidates and parties navigate these dynamics to appeal to various voting blocs, often leading to strategic alignments or divisions within the broader minority coalition.
Conclusion:
Kamala Harris’s identity influences U.S. politics, highlighting racial dynamics and intersectional conflicts. The Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling fuels tensions among minority groups, while the election’s outcome could reshape U.S.-India relations and diaspora engagement policies.
