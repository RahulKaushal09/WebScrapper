New research reveals that long-dormant volcanoes in the Cascades region of the Pacific Northwest still have substantial magma reservoirs beneath them.
About Cascade Range:
It is a prominent collection of mountains found in the
Pacific Northwest area
northwestern United States and southwestern Canada.
The range was
formed by the subduction of
Juan de Fuca Plate beneath the North American Plate
, which continues to drive volcanic activity.
It is known for its
snow-capped peaks,
massive glaciers,
steep scree slopes, and lush forests.
The range is home to 4375 named mountains, the highest and most visible of which is
Mount Rainier

**********M23 Rebels
Rwanda-backed M23 rebels recently captured the regional capital Goma in an anarchic and mineral-rich part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
About M23 Rebels:
M23, or the
March 23 Movement
, is one of more than 100 armed groups
fighting Congolese forces in
the mineral-rich
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
M23’s leadership is
dominated by ethnic Tutsis
, a
minority group
in eastern DR Congo.
It is present in
North Kivu province in areas bordering Rwanda and Uganda
and has more than 8,000 fighters, according to the UN.
named after the date in 2009
signing of an accord between
the National Congress for the Defence of the People
(CNDP), a Tutsi-led rebel group,
and the Congolese government
to end a revolt led by the Tutsi people in eastern DRC.
The agreement promised better political representation and integration of former rebels into the Congolese army.
It is alleged that
Rwanda is backing the M23 rebels.
Why is M23 fighting Congolese forces?
It was created in 2012 after former CNDP troops rebelled against the Congolese government, accusing it of failing to implement the 2009 agreement by integrating Tutsi fighters into the army, protecting minorities, and distributing resources evenly.
Its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to the DRC after taking part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that targeted Tutsis.

**********Donkey Route
Indian deportees from the US, arriving in Amritsar, recently shared their harrowing experiences using the "donkey route" for illegal immigration.
About Donkey Route:
Named after a Punjabi
idiom referring to an arduous, unplanned journe
y, it involves
crossing multiple international borders
, often through
treacherous terrain,
under false promises of legal entry.
It typically
involves illegal border crossings via indirect routes
with multiple stops in different countries.
For instance, individuals might obtain a tourist visa for the European Union's Schengen Area, allowing free movement across 26 countries, and then illegally enter the UK with the help of "consultants" or "agents."
These agents often charge hefty fees for services ranging from fake documentation to smuggling via shipping containers.

**********Marsupials
Recently, a team of scientists has successfully produced the first kangaroo embryos using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) which could be a crucial step towards the conservation of endangered marsupial species.
About Marsupials:
Marsupials are the group of mammals commonly thought of as
pouched mammals.
They give
birth to relatively undeveloped young
that often reside in a pouch located on their mothers' abdomen for a certain amount of time.
A distinctive characteristic common to most of these species is that the young are carried in a pouch. They have an extra pubic bone, the
epipubic bone
, to support their pouch.
Examples:
Marsupials include opossums, Tasmanian devils, kangaroos, koalas, wombats, wallabies, bandicoots, and the extinct thylacine.
They represent the clade originating from the last common ancestor of
extant metatherian,
the group containing all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals.
Not all marsupials have pouches
Distribution:
There are over 330 species of marsupials. Around two-thirds of them live in The other third live mostly in
South America.
What is In-Vitro Fertilization?
It is a
medical procedure
used to assist individuals or couples who are facing fertility challenges in achieving pregnancy.
It is the most common and effective type of assisted
reproductive technology (ART).
Process:
It is a complex process that involves
retrieving eggs
from ovaries and manually combining them with sperm in a lab for fertilization.
Several days after fertilization, the fertilized egg (now called an embryo) is placed inside a uterus.
Pregnancy occurs when this embryo implants itself into the uterine wall.
The procedure can be done using a couple's own eggs and sperm. Or IVF may involve eggs, sperm or embryos from a known or anonymous donor.

**********US President Trump Imposes Sanctions on the International Criminal Court
Why in the News?
U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court over investigations of Israel, a close U.S. ally.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article, Reasons Behind Sanctions)
Significance / Criticism / Implications of the Sanctions
Background:
, imposing sanctions on the
(ICC)
The move comes in response to the ICC’s issuance of an
arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for alleged war crimes committed in
Gaza
following the
Hamas attack in October 2023
Neither the
United States
nor
recognizes the ICC’s jurisdiction, leading Trump to denounce the court's actions as
“illegitimate and baseless”
This order marks another significant step in the U.S. stance against the ICC’s interventions in American and allied affairs.
Reasons Behind Donald Trump Imposing Sanctions on the ICC:
ICC’s Arrest Warrant for Israeli Leaders
The ICC issued an
arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant
, holding them accountable for Israel’s
military actions in Gaza
after the 2023 Hamas attack.
The conflict resulted in
tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties, including children
, drawing widespread international condemnation.
U.S. and Israel’s Non-Recognition of ICC
Israel nor the U.S. is a member of the ICC
, as both governments reject the court’s authority over their national security matters.
Trump’s executive order argues that the
ICC is setting a dangerous precedent
by prosecuting leaders of non-member states.
Trump’s Defense of U.S. Allies
The executive order states that the
ICC’s actions are a direct attack on a close U.S. ally
, and that targeting Netanyahu is
unacceptable
The U.S. government has long been wary of an
international tribunal holding American and allied officials accountable for military operations
Significance of the Sanctions:
Trump's executive order threatens
“tangible and significant consequences”
for ICC officials involved in the investigation against Israel. These include:
Freezing Assets and Property
– ICC officials and their associates could have their
U.S. assets frozen
Travel Bans
– ICC prosecutors and their
family members may be denied entry into the U.S.
Restrictions on Collaborators
– Individuals and organizations that assist the ICC’s investigations could face
legal consequences
under U.S. laws.
This is not the first time the
U.S. has sanctioned ICC officials
. In 2020, Trump imposed similar measures against
then-Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda
for investigating alleged U.S. war crimes in
Afghanistan
. However, these sanctions were later lifted under
President Joe Biden
Criticism of Trump’s Decision:
Human Rights Organizations Condemn the Move
Human Rights Watch
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
have denounced the sanctions, calling them
an attack on international justice
As per the ACLU, the
sanctions would discourage victims of human rights abuses from seeking justice
through the ICC.
Concerns Over Free Speech and Accountability
Critics argue that the
executive order violates First Amendment rights
U.S. citizens who assist the ICC could face penalties
Impact on U.S. Global Influence
The move raises concerns about the U.S. appearing to
shield its allies from accountability
while advocating for international justice elsewhere.
2023, the U.S. supported ICC charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin
for war crimes in Ukraine, showing
inconsistency in its stance toward the court
Political and Diplomatic Implications:
Trump’s sanctions on the ICC could have
long-term geopolitical consequences
Strengthening U.S.-Israel Relations
– The move is likely to
deepen U.S.-Israel ties
, as Trump presents himself as a defender of Israel against international scrutiny.
Straining U.S. Relations with Europe
– Many European nations support the ICC’s role in
prosecuting war crimes
, and this decision could create friction between the
S. and its European allies
Future of U.S. Foreign Policy
– Trump’s his
aggressive stance against international institutions
like the ICC could reshape
U.S. foreign policy
in future global conflicts.

**********RBI Reviews Economic Capital Framework: Implications for Risk Buffer and Surplus Transfers
Why in the News?
Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Governor said the central bank is currently reviewing the Economic Capital Framework (ECF).
What’s in Today’s Article?
About ECF (Meaning, Utility, etc.)
RBI’s Review of ECF (Key Observations, Impact of Review, Significance, etc.)
Understanding the Economic Capital Framework (ECF):
The
is a policy that determines how the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
manages its financial reserves, risk provisioning, and surplus transfers to the central government.
It sets guidelines for the
contingency risk buffer (CRB)
—a financial reserve maintained by the RBI to address unforeseen economic crises.
Bimal Jalan Committee
, formed in
2018
, recommended that the
CRB should be maintained between 5.5% to 6.5% of the RBI’s balance sheet
This buffer acts as a safeguard for economic stability, ensuring that the RBI can function effectively as the
Lender of Last Resort (LoLR)
during financial crises.
Since
2019
, the RBI has followed these recommendations, and any revisions to the framework could influence how much surplus the RBI transfers to the government in future years.
RBI’s Current Review of the ECF:
RBI Governor’s Statement on ECF Review
Recently
, RBI Governor
confirmed that the central bank is
This periodic review, recommended by the
, is meant to assess whether any adjustments are needed in the CRB range.
Malhotra clarified that while the
current CRB stands at 6.5% (as of March 31, 2024)
, the review could lead to an
increase or decrease
in the required buffer, though no immediate changes have been confirmed.
Background on the Bimal Jalan Committee Recommendations
Bimal Jalan-led panel
had suggested a
five-year review cycle
for the ECF, with its recommendations valid from
June 2019 to June 2024
Given this timeline, the RBI has now begun an
internal assessment
to evaluate whether changes are necessary.
According to
RBI Deputy Governor
, the review will help determine if the current framework remains effective or if modifications are required to address evolving financial conditions.
Impact of the ECF Review on RBI’s Surplus Transfers:
Record Surplus Transfer to the Government in 2023-24
For the
financial year 2023-24
RBI approved a record surplus transfer of ₹2.11 lakh crore
This amount significantly boosts government revenue and helps finance fiscal policies, including infrastructure projects and social welfare programs.
How CRB Adjustments Could Affect Future Dividends
Economists believe that
any revision in the CRB threshold
could directly
impact future surplus transfers
If the
CRB requirement is increased
, the RBI may need to
set aside more reserves
, reducing the
amount of surplus available for government transfers
Conversely, if the
CRB is lowered
, it could
free up more funds
for dividend payments.
However, as per the officials, the decision to
revise the CRB is not linked to current global uncertainties
, and any change will be
based purely on economic factors
rather than short-term concerns.
Importance of ECF Review:
Ensuring Economic Stability
serves as an essential financial safeguard against
global financial instability, banking crises, and currency fluctuations
Maintaining an adequate
buffer ensures that the RBI can respond effectively to any economic downturn
Impact on Government Budget Planning
RBI’s surplus transfers
play a crucial role in supporting
government spending and fiscal deficit management
Any change in the ECF could
influence the government’s budgetary planning
for the upcoming fiscal years.
Balancing Risk and Development Needs
The RBI must strike a balance between
maintaining financial stability
providing surplus funds
to the government.
CRB is increased
strengthen the financial resilience
of the central bank but may
reduce funds available for government initiatives
Conclusion:
The RBI’s review of the Economic Capital Framework is a crucial exercise that could determine the future
allocation of financial reserves and surplus distribution
While the
current contingency risk buffer (CRB) stands at 6.5%
, the review will assess whether adjustments are needed to
maintain economic resilience
higher CRB
could enhance financial security but reduce the
RBI’s surplus transfers to the government
, while a
lower CRB
could provide the government with more fiscal resources but may
increase financial risks
As the
five-year review process unfolds
, all eyes will be on the RBI’s decision, which will have
long-term implications for India’s economic and fiscal stability

**********Technology and the Challenge of Equitable Education
Context
The
evolution of digital technology in India over the past three decades has brought with it new opportunities and challenges
, especially in the field of education.
COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the digital transformation in rural India
, providing an unexpected push toward digital education.
Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) data reflect this transformation, highlighting the growing accessibility of smartphones
, the integration of digital learning tools, and the potential of technology to bridge educational gaps.
However,
despite these advancements, significant challenges remain, particularly in ensuring that technology benefits the underprivileged
and enhances learning outcomes effectively.
An Overview of the Rise of Digital Technology in Rural Education
Before the pandemic,
digital education remained largely inaccessible to rural communities due to the lack of devices,
connectivity, and digital literacy.
as ASER data indicate, smartphone ownership in rural households has increased dramatically, from 36% in 2018 to 84% in 2024.
increasing accessibility of smartphones among children
, particularly teenagers,
suggests a growing familiarity with digital technology.
This shift has the potential to transform learning experiences
, allowing students access to educational content, online courses, and virtual training sessions.
During the pandemic,
digital tools primarily served as a substitute for traditional textbooks
, with schools relying on digital worksheets, video lessons, and online assignments.
While some of these practices diminished after the pandemic,
the skills developed during this period laid the foundation for continued digital engagement.
Today, with advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),
digital learning is entering a new phase, promising greater personalisation, accessibility, and interactive learning experiences.
Challenges in Utilising Technology for Education
Limited Access to Devices and Internet Connectivity
Although smartphone ownership has increased significantly in rural India,
access to personal devices for education remains uneven.
Many households share a single smartphone
among multiple family members, limiting children's ability to use it for uninterrupted learning.
Furthermore,
while urban areas benefit from reliable internet connectivity, many rural regions still struggle with poor network coverage, slow data speeds
, and expensive internet plans.
Digital Literacy and Lack of Technological Awareness
Digital literacy,
the ability to navigate digital platforms, search for relevant content, and use educational applications, is still low
among many rural students, parents, and even teachers.
ASER data suggest that
a large percentage of mothers in rural India have received little to no formal education.
If parents are not digitally literate, they may struggle to guide their children
in using
digital learning tools effectively.
any teachers in rural schools have limited exposure to digital teaching methods,
making it difficult for them to integrate technology into their classrooms.
digital learning resources are becoming more available, many students and teachers do not receive adequate training
on how to use them efficiently.
Fragmented School Attendance and Learning Outcomes
Although school access has improved in rural India,
learning remains highly fragmented due to inconsistent attendance and varied schooling systems.
Some children attend government schools, others go to private institutions, and some rely on informal tuition centres.
Many children, especially in rural areas, skip school due to economic pressures
, seasonal migration, or lack of parental enforcement.
makes it difficult to integrate digital learning
as a regular practice.
While digital learning tools exist, they often operate in isolation
rather than complementing the existing school curriculum.
Without structured implementation, technology-based education may not effectively address learning gaps.
Language and Content Limitations
Historically,
language barriers
have restricted access to quality digital education in India. Most high-quality educational content is available in English, making it difficult for students from non-English-speaking backgrounds to engage with digital learning effectively.
Although AI-powered translation tools are improving,
high-quality interactive content in regional languages is still lacking.
Many educational resources are designed from a Western perspective
, making them less relatable for rural Indian students.
Many digital learning platforms rely on text-heavy content,
which may not be suitable for students with weak literacy skills.
The Role of AI and Future Prospects
As digital learning evolves,
AI presents new possibilities for education.
AI-driven tools can help customize learning paths
, provide real-time feedback, and make educational content available in multiple languages.
Language barriers
, which previously hindered access to digital learning resources,
are gradually diminishing due to AI-powered translation and voice recognition tools.
However, while technological advancements are promising,
they must be implemented strategically to ensure they serve the needs of the underprivileged.
The Way Forward: Balancing Profit and Public Good in Digital Education
Technology companies often operate within a for-profit model, which raises concerns about whether digital education can be truly universalised
without significant philanthropic and governmental investments.
While some initiatives aim to provide free educational resources
, large-scale implementation of digital education solutions requires substantial funding, infrastructure, and policy support.
India needs a well-defined roadmap to ensure that technology serves as an equalising force
rather than exacerbating existing disparities.
One possible solution is
the establishment of digital learning hubs within rural communities,
where intelligent devices provide structured educational support.
Such hubs could serve as knowledge centres, answering students’ questions
, guiding learning processes, and supplementing formal schooling.
Additionally
, community-driven digital education programs, similar to the pandemic-era broadcast learning initiatives in Maharashtra
, could be expanded to enhance accessibility and engagement.
Conclusion
The rapid expansion of smartphone access has created unprecedented opportunities
for learning, but meaningful progress requires addressing key challenges.
AI and other emerging technologies hold great promise,
but their benefits must be made accessible to all, particularly the underprivileged.
strategic approach, balancing innovation, affordability, and inclusivity, will be essential
in realising the true potential of digital education in India.

**********Gold Investments in India Surge by 60% in 2024: World Gold Council Report
Mains Paper 3
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Market Economy; Demand and Supply; Gold Market;
Why in the News?
According to the
World Gold Council,
Gold investments in India increased by 60% in 2024, reaching $18 billion (around Rs 1.5 lakh crore), compared to the previous year.
What are the Key highlights of the Report?
The
World Gold Council (WGC)
was founded in 1987 by leading gold mining companies. Its purpose is
to stimulate and sustain demand for gold
It aims to promote gold as a strategic asset and to advance a responsible, transparent, and accessible gold supply chain.
The WGC has
32 members
with mining operations in over 45 countries and is headquartered in
London, UK
Best Price Performance Since 2010:
Gold recorded its
strongest annual price rise
since
, driven by geopolitical uncertainties and interest rate expectations.
Global demand:
It grew by
25% whereas investment demand
29%
(2023).
Global Supply:
It increased by 1% mainly on account of mine production and recycling.
India accounted for
20% of the global gold investment demand
, which stood at
1,180 tonnes
in 2024.
Outlook for 2025:
Central banks and Gold Exchange Traded Funds are likely to drive demand.
India:
RBI added
73 tonnes of gold to its forex reserves,
raising gold’s share to a record
11%.
What are the reasons for the Increase in Gold Demand in India?
Cultural Significance:
Gold is deeply ingrained in Indian culture, and its purchase is considered auspicious during festivals and weddings. For example, bridal jewelry alone accounts for at least half of the gold jewelry market share in India.
Investment and Hedge Against Uncertainty:
Gold is seen as a safe haven investment, especially during times of economic and geopolitical instability. For instance, geopolitical tensions, such as the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, have increased demand for gold as investors seek a safe-haven asset.
Inflation Hedge:
Gold is considered a hedge against inflation, preserving wealth when the purchasing power of fiat currencies declines. For every 1% increase in inflation, gold demand increases by 2.6%.
Central Bank Buying:
Central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), increase their gold holdings to diversify forex reserves and hedge against external uncertainties. The RBI bought 19 tonnes of gold in the first quarter of 2024, already surpassing the 16 tonnes purchased in all of 2023.
Weakening Dollar:
When the US dollar weakens, it becomes cheaper for investors holding other currencies to buy gold, increasing demand and driving prices up. A weaker dollar boosts demand, as seen with the US dollar easing by 0.2% and leading to an increase in gold prices.
What is the present Status of Gold Resources?
November 2024,
central banks globally added 53 tonnes to their gold reserves. This indicates a continued recognition of gold as a stable and secure asset, particularly in emerging markets.
As of
the United States holds the largest gold reserves in the world, with 8,133.5 tonnes. India is among the top 10 countries in the world with the highest gold reserves.
April 1, 2015,
India had an estimated 501.83 million tonnes of gold ore reserves. Approximately 17.22 million tonnes were categorized as reserves, with the remainder classified as remaining resources.
The largest reserves of gold ore are located in
Bihar (44%),
followed by Rajasthan (25%), Karnataka (21%), West Bengal (3%), Andhra Pradesh (3%), and Jharkhand (2%).
The remaining 2% of reserves are distributed among Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu.
Geological Survey of India (GSI)
is actively involved in geological mapping and mineral exploration to identify potential mineral-rich zones.
To encourage private sector participation, the Indian government has amended the
Minerals Evidence of Mineral Contents Rules
for the exploration and mining of deep-seated minerals, including gold
What are the negatives of buying physical gold for the country?
Increases Trade Deficit & Current Account Deficit (CAD):
Countries with
high gold imports
, like
, see a
widening trade deficit
, as more foreign exchange is spent on gold rather than productive assets. Example: In 2023, India’s
gold imports surged to over $43 billion
, contributing to a
rising CAD (Current Account Deficit)
and putting pressure on the rupee.
Encourages Smuggling & Black Market Activities:
High demand and import duties often lead to
illegal gold smuggling
, fueling the
underground economy
. Example: In 2022,
1,000+ kg of gold was smuggled into India
, bypassing import duties and causing
tax revenue losses
for the government.
Non-Productive Asset & Storage Risks:
Unlike stocks or bonds,
gold does not generate income
and remains idle in lockers,
reducing capital available for economic growth
. Example: In Turkey, during
economic crises
, citizens hoarded gold instead of investing in businesses, slowing economic recovery.
Way forward:
Promote Gold-Backed Financial Instruments:
Encourage investments in
Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs), Gold ETFs, and Digital Gold
to reduce reliance on physical gold while ensuring capital appreciation and interest earnings.
Implement Smarter Import Policies & Monetization Schemes:
Rationalize
to curb smuggling and expand
gold monetization schemes
to bring idle gold into the formal financial system, boosting liquidity and economic growth.
Mains PYQ:
Craze for gold in Indian has led to surge in import of gold in recent years and put pressure on balance of payments and external value of rupee. In view of this, examine the merits of Gold Monetization scheme.

Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Health Sector;
Why in the News?
India has around 3,00,000 diagnostic labs, and the number is increasing. However, the sector is largely unregulated, scattered, and concentrated in urban areas.
What is the significance of India’s Diagnostics Sector?
Market Size and Growth:
The Indian diagnostics market was valued at approximately US$13 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach US$25 billion by FY28. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 14%. Some projections estimate the market could reach US$40 billion by 2034.
Essential Component of Healthcare:
Diagnostics play a crucial role in disease prevention, early detection, and effective management, making them an essential part of modern healthcare. Doctor recommendations drive a major part of the diagnostic business, with tests being conducted for most patients before prescribing medication.
Key Market Segments:
The sector is primarily divided into pathology (60%) and radiology (40%). Pathology is further broken down into illness (acute and chronic) and wellness segments.
Drivers of Growth:
Several factors contribute to the sector’s growth, including increasing life expectancy, a growing middle class, higher penetration of government insurance schemes, rising income levels, and increasing awareness of preventive testing. An aging population and the rise in chronic diseases also fuel the demand for diagnostic services.
What are the challenges faced by the Diagnostics Sector?
Urban-Rural Divide:
A significant portion of diagnostics revenue (76%) comes from urban areas, even though 70% of India’s population resides in rural areas.
Disparities in Infrastructure:
Rural areas have fewer healthcare facilities, with only about 36.5% of the total hospital beds, leading to delayed treatments and poorer health outcomes
Regulatory Issues
: The
Kerala State Clinical Establishments Act
faces resistance due to stringent
space (300 sq. ft. in rural areas, 500-700 sq. ft. in urban areas)
educational requirements
, making compliance unviable for many small labs.
Standardization Needs
: Lack of uniform testing protocols leads to errors.
Example
: A
government lab in Karnataka
reported a
platelet count of 0.47 lakh/cmm
, but a private lab retest showed
2.2 lakh/cmm
, highlighting the need for
mandatory NABL accreditation and standard SOPs
to ensure diagnostic accuracy.
Infrastructure Gaps in Public Sector:
Lack of essential upgrades in government labs (e.g., Osmania and Gandhi Hospitals in Hyderabad). Limited operational hours and unavailability of specialists in government hospitals force patients to private facilities.
What are the present Regulations implemented by the govt for this Sector?
Clinical Establishments Act, 2010:
This act aims to regulate diagnostic centers but has been adopted by only 12 states and Union Territories, leading to inconsistent regulations across the country.
Medical Devices Rules, 2017:

Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Regionalism v/s nationalism;
Why in the News?
Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar said that some groups take advantage of the legal system for their own gain and weaken the country’s unity.
Why is the discussion of regionalism v/s nationalism considered problematic in the context of India?
Threat to National Unity
: Excessive emphasis on regionalism can fuel separatist tendencies, as seen in the Khalistan movement in Punjab and insurgencies in the Northeast, undermining India’s unity and sovereignty.
Federalism vs. Centralization Conflict
: India’s governance relies on cooperative federalism, where both the Union and states share powers. However, debates like Tamil Nadu’s opposition to central exams like NEET highlight tensions between regional autonomy and national policies.
Political Exploitation & Vote Bank Politics
: Political parties sometimes exploit regional sentiments for electoral gains, leading to polarization. For example, Maharashtra’s “sons of the soil” policy has led to conflicts over job reservations for locals, creating friction between states.
Economic Disparities & Development Hurdles
: Overemphasis on regional identity can obstruct national projects. Protests against infrastructure projects like hydroelectric dams in Arunachal Pradesh due to local concerns show how regional interests can sometimes slow down national development.
Cultural & Linguistic Divides
: Attempts to impose a singular national identity, such as making Hindi the sole link language, have faced resistance from states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, highlighting the delicate balance between regional pride and national integration.
What are the specific divisive forces that undermine national unity?
Caste and Religious Polarization
: Social divisions based on caste and religion are exploited for political and electoral gains, leading to communal tensions (e.g., Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013 fueled by religious divisions).
Regionalism and Sub-Nationalism
: Excessive regional pride sometimes leads to demands for secession or special status, disrupting national integration (e.g., Gorkhaland agitation in West Bengal, calls for an independent Nagalim in the Northeast).
External Influence and Misinformation
: Foreign-backed propaganda and misinformation campaigns on social media create unrest by deepening societal divisions (e.g., Pakistan-backed online campaigns related to Article 370 abrogation in Jammu & Kashmir).
How are attempts being made to influence the electoral process?
Foreign Interference & Propaganda
: External forces use misinformation campaigns on social media to shape voter perceptions (e.g., Allegations of foreign-backed digital campaigns influencing Indian elections, as seen in narratives around Article 370).
Money Power & Undisclosed Funding
: Illicit election financing and opaque political donations influence outcomes (e.g., Concerns over electoral bonds and their impact on political funding transparency).
Judicial Route & PIL Misuse
: Frequent litigation is filed to delay elections, challenge candidates, or question EVMs without solid evidence (e.g., Multiple PILs questioning EVM credibility, despite SC and EC assurances).
Targeted Voter Suppression
: Manipulative voter deletion campaigns and fake voter registration attempts (e.g., Complaints of large-scale voter deletions in Karnataka elections, raising concerns over fairness).
Big Tech & Algorithmic Manipulation
: Social media platforms and AI-driven algorithms are used to spread divisive narratives and influence voter sentiment (e.g., Allegations of biased content promotion on platforms like Facebook and X (Twitter) during elections).
Way forward:
Strengthening Electoral and Judicial Integrity:
Implement stricter regulations on election funding, curb misuse of judicial processes, and enhance transparency in political donations to safeguard democratic institutions.
Promoting National Cohesion Through Inclusive Policies:
Foster cooperative federalism, ensure balanced regional development, and encourage cultural inclusivity to prevent divisive narratives and reinforce national unity.

Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
According to the recent
ACER Survey 2024,
India lacks a road map in the field of education that allows the promise of technology to be harnessed for those who need it the most.
What are the Key Highlights given by ASER 2024?
Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)
is a citizen-led survey that provides estimates of schooling and learning levels in rural India. Published by the
NGO Pratham
, ASER has been conducted since
2005
. After 2016, the survey transitioned to an
alternate-year model,
with the “basic” ASER conducted in all rural districts every other year. In the intervening years, a smaller survey focuses on specific age groups and domains. The “basic” ASER tracks
enrollment for children aged 3-16
and assesses the
reading and arithmetic skills of children aged 5-16
through
household surveys.
Academic Observations and Reporting:
Since 2006, private school enrollment in rural India has been increasing, plateauing at 30.8% in 2014 and remaining there in 2018.
Basic arithmetic abilities in
Class 3
have risen to
33.7% in 2024
, exceeding both 2022 and 2018 rates.
Class 5
reading levels are also up, nearly matching 2018 figures, although private schools have not yet reached their pre-pandemic reading levels.
Attendance for both teachers and students
in government elementary schools has improved. Several states have pre-primary enrollment rates above 90%.
Focus on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy:
The big push for foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) under
NEP 2020
NIPUN Bharat Mission
has helped to improve foundational learning through better resources, learning materials, and teacher training which appears to be a major contributor to the improvements noted in the ASER 2024 report.
Emphasis on Early Childhood Education:
NEP 2020’s emphasis on early childhood education is expected to further improve access, as ASER 2024 reported increased enrollment in early childhood education, with almost 80% of children aged
3 to 6 years
enrolled in some form of pre-primary education.
Improved Accessibility and Potential:
In 2018, approximately 90% of rural households possessed basic mobile phones, while 36% owned smartphones. By 2022, smartphone ownership in these households increased to over 74%, and further to 84% in 2024, but educational use is limited to 57%.
Among children aged 14-16, smartphone ownership rose from 19% to about 31% within a year.
Smartphones were mainly used to send texts, worksheets, and videos during the pandemic as a substitute for textbooks. Digital skills from the pandemic remained relevant, and artificial intelligence (AI) generated new interest.
Reversing Pandemic Losses:
The ASER 2024 report suggests a rebound from the learning losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in government schools, where reading and arithmetic skills have reached or exceeded pre-pandemic levels.
The improvement in standard III implies that some of its credit can go to the
NIPUN Bharat Mission.
What are the present challenges of digital divide in India according to ASER Report 2024?
Gender Disparity:
Boys outpace girls in access, ownership, and smartphone usage, which puts girls at a disadvantage and exacerbates existing inequalities. Even when smartphones are available, girls face systemic barriers that limit their access, such as social norms, parental control, and prioritization of boys’ education.
Access vs. Usage:
While nearly all children between 14 and 16 have access to cell phones, only 57% use smart devices for education-related activities, while about 76% use them for social media.
Variations Across States:
ASER 2024 indicates wide variations in digital literacy across states.
Digital Literacy Skills:
While smartphone access is widespread, structured digital education programs can enhance meaningful use of technology for learning.
There is a gender gap in digital skills, with 85.5% of boys and 79.4% of girls reporting that they know how to use a smartphone.
Smartphone Ownership:
There is a gender gap in smartphone ownership, with only 36.2% of boys and 26.9% of girls reporting owning a smartphone.
This lack of personal ownership limits access and curtails opportunities for girls to explore and learn independently.
How can technology be leveraged to bridge the digital divide and ensure equitable access to educational resources?
Targeted distribution of school-owned devices:
Schools can monitor device-to-student ratios to decide how each device can best support specific learning activities within the curriculum.
Distribution can be based on the individual needs of the student, ensuring that each device is allocated where it can have the most significant impact on learning.
Embrace pedagogically-led technology integration:
Prioritizing integrating technology in a way that enhances the learning experience as a whole can ensure that every student benefits from the transformative potential of digital tools.
This includes how educators are trained in technology as a means to achieve equitable learning outcomes.
Assess Needs and Resources:
Survey families to understand current technology access at home and take inventory of existing school technology equipment and infrastructure. Identify areas that need upgrades to support 1:1 device programs.
Provide Multiple Access Options:
Offer devices that students can use at school and take home and create a community technology center with free WiFi, computers, and printers. Partner with community organizations to provide access outside of school
