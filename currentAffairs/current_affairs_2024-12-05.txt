Mohan Bhagwat’s Three-Child Plan: Why Concern About India’s Falling Fertility Rate is Misplaced
Context
Demographic trends have traditionally been viewed as slow-moving, resistant to rapid shifts
like socioeconomic indicators.
However,
concerns around fertility rates in India have sparked significant debate
, ranging from fears of labour shortages to imbalances in political representation.
Therefore,
it is crucial to examine these concerns, the proposed remedies, and explore viable pathways to address India’s demographic and socioeconomic challenges.
Shifting Demographic Narratives
India has witnessed a
dramatic shift in its demographic discourse.
Where unchecked fertility rates were once perceived as a threat to development,
the narrative now includes fears of labour shortages due to falling fertility rates.
Notably,
concerns about regional imbalances in political representation and economic disparity have gained prominence.
the implications of achieving below-replacement fertility rates have not been adequately scrutinised
before advocating measures to increase fertility.
Why Advocacy for Higher Fertility is Misguided and Economic Risks of Over emphasising Population Growth
Ignoring the Consequence of Overpopulation and Resource Strain
India is already grappling with a
population expected to exceed 1.6 billion by 2060.
This
massive number places enormous pressure on the country's resources, infrastructure, and social services,
particularly in economically weaker states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand.
Encouraging higher fertility rates in these regions
, which already struggle with poverty, inadequate healthcare, and limited access to education,
risks worsening existing inequalities.
A population boom in such areas
would likely exacerbate unemployment and strain public services,
further entrenching cycles of poverty and underdevelopment.
Regional Disparities in Fertility Trends
Southern states
like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka
have already achieved fertility rates well below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman.
These states are unlikely to reverse their demographic transition
, as lower fertility rates are typically driven by factors such as higher levels of education, improved healthcare, and urbanization.
Conversely, the northern states, which continue to have higher fertility rates, are more likely to respond to policies that emphasise better healthcare
and education rather than slogans promoting increased birth rates.
Underestimation of Social and Cultural Realities
Proposals advocating for higher fertility
also underestimate the role of societal factors in reproductive decisions.
Couples typically base family size on practical considerations such as financial stability,
access to childcare, and aspirations for a better quality of life for their children.
In modern India, where aspirations for upward mobility and better living standards dominate, political exhortations are unlikely to influence
reproductive behaviour
Regional Disparities and Political Concerns
Southern states with lower fertility rates fear losing political representation
and federal funding due to their declining population share.
This apprehension has led some leaders to advocate for higher fertility in the South,
however,
adopting competitive population growth strategies is not the solution.
Instead,
southern states should advocate for reforms in funding allocation and political representation criteria
that prioritise administrative efficiency over population size.
While the concerns about labour shortages and ageing populations
in the South are
valid, they are not insurmountable.
Fertility rates in many states remain above replacement levels,
and regional labour shortages can be mitigated through enhanced mobility and migration policies.
Economic Risks of Overemphasizing Population Growth
without corresponding economic and infrastructural support
could have dire consequences.
Increased population growth would place additional demands on education, healthcare, and housing systems
, potentially negating economic gains.
For example,
the rise in population in poorer regions could lead to a larger unskilled workforce
, further flooding the informal sector and driving down wages.
Labour Market Challenges and Historical Lessons in Labour Management
country’s female work participation rate remains alarmingly low
compared to other developing nations, despite recent improvements.
demographic transition offers an opportunity to empower women
through skill development and increased participation in the formal economy.
Moreover,
India’s vast reservoir of semi-employed workers in low-productivity sectors could transition to modern industries
with adequate policy support.
History offers examples of countries successfully managing stable or declining populations
without resorting to fertility increases.
Nations like Germany and Singapore have navigated labour shortages by promoting international migration
, investing in skill development, and automating industries.
India, too, can address potential labour shortages through similar measures
, rather than through unsustainable population growth.
Simplifying migration policies, improving interstate mobility
, and ensuring better living and working conditions for workers
could help address regional labour mismatches.
A Better Approach to Demographic Management
Investing in Healthcare and Education
Improving maternal and child healthcare not only reduces mortality rates but also leads to healthier populations
capable of contributing productively to the economy.
Ensuring universal access to family planning services
and modern contraceptives is equally
vital in empowering couples to make informed reproductive choices.
There is a strong correlation between education, especially female education, and reduced fertility rates.
Education delays the age of marriage, improves knowledge
about family planning,
and increases women’s participation in the workforce.
Programs that focus on expanding access to education
, particularly in rural and underserved regions, can significantly stabilize fertility rates
while creating long-term economic growth.
Encouraging Skill Development
India has a significant workforce trapped in low-productivity sectors
, such as subsistence agriculture and informal labour markets.
By investing in vocational training and skill-building programs
, particularly in high-demand sectors like manufacturing, technology, and healthcare,
India can create a more productive workforce.
Initiatives such as Skill India and Digital India need to be scaled up
and better integrated with regional needs.
Enhancing Migration Policies
This includes reducing documentation barriers, creating interstate labour registries
, and providing incentives for industries to employ migrant workers.
Ensuring proper housing, healthcare, and educational facilities for migrant workers
and their families can make migration a viable and attractive option.
States can also collaborate to create comprehensive welfare schemes for migrants,
reducing friction between sending and receiving regions.
Promoting Female Workforce Participation
Enabling flexible work arrangements, extending maternity benefits, and ensuring workplace safety can encourage more women
to enter and remain in the workforce.
Special focus on skill development for women, particularly in technology
and other growth-oriented sectors, can expand their opportunities.
Facilitating access to credit and mentorship for female entrepreneurs can further empower women
Conclusion
India’s demographic transition is not an impending crisis but a challenge that requires strategic planning
and thoughtful policies.
Instead of resorting to simplistic calls for higher fertility, policymakers must address structural issues in labour mobility, gender empowerment
, and ageing support systems.
With a balanced and inclusive approach, India can transform demographic changes into opportunities
for sustainable development.

**********Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70)
The team from JNU's Special Centre for Molecular Medicine, identified a human protein, Hsp70, as a critical factor in the spread of diseases like malaria and Covid-19.
About Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70):
Hsp70 is a type of
molecular chaperone,
a protein that plays a vital role in helping other proteins fold into their proper shapes and preventing misfolding.
It plays a crucial
role in regulating protein synthesis
and protecting proteins from stress.
It becomes
elevated during times of cellular stress
and they help to shield cells from further insults.
Role in human body:
It plays an important
role in protein folding
preventing protein aggregation and transport of proteins
across membranes. It is crucial for protein homeostasis and cell survival.
Highlights of the research:
The team of researchers discovered that
Hsp70 interacts with the spike protein
of SARS-CoV-2—the virus responsible for Covid-19—and human ACE2 receptors, which the virus uses to enter cells.
They hypothesized that during fever, Hsp70 levels rise and help stabilise this interaction, making it easier for the virus to infect cells. By inhibiting Hsp70, the researchers successfully blocked viral replication in lab tests.
The research suggests that targeting Hsp70
might help prevent drug resistance
, a growing problem in treating infections.

**********Akal Takht and the SAD
Why in news?
Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) President Sukhbir Singh Badal was shot at near the Golden Temple while on guard duty but remained unharmed.
Badal, on a wheelchair due to a fractured foot, has been given religious punishment by the Akal Takht for alleged misrule during the SAD government (2007-2017). Other former Cabinet members are also performing atonement as ordered by the Akal Takht, including cleaning bathrooms and utensils.
What’s in today’s article?
What is the Akal Takht?
Functioning of Akal Takht after the passing of Guru Gobind Singh
Appointment of Jathedar (head) of the Akal Takht
The Authority and Role of the Akal Takht Jathedar
Relationship between the Shiromani Akali Dal and the SGPC
Establishment of the Akal Takht
The Akal Takht was established by the sixth Sikh master Guru Hargobind in 1606 following the execution of his father, Guru Arjan Dev, by the Mughals.
It is located opposite the Harmandir Sahib in the Golden Temple complex.
Guru Hargobind used this platform for governance, and is believed to have issued the first directive (Hukamnama) from here, urging Sikh congregations to contribute horses and weapons to the Panth.
Symbolism of Miri and Piri – two swords
The Guru is said to have requested two swords, symbolising miri (temporal power) and piri (spirituality).
The sword representing miri was slightly shorter, indicating the primacy of spiritual authority over temporal power.
Defiance of Mughal Authority
The Akal Takht was also a symbol and representation of the Sikh defiance of Mughal authority.
The 12-foot-high platform of the Akal Takht was a direct challenge to Emperor Jahangir’s 11-foot-high throne in Agra and Delhi, symbolising Sikh defiance.
Historical Significance
The Akal Takht became a powerful symbol of Sikh governance, spirituality, and opposition to oppressive regimes.
The Akal Takht served as a key gathering point for Sikhs during periods of persecution, particularly after Banda Singh Bahadur's execution in 1716.
Sikhs assembled there during Baisakhi and Diwali for
Sarbat Khalsa meetings
to make critical decisions.
This tradition continued into the early 19th century, with
Maharaja Ranjit Singh convening one of the last Sarbat Khalsa assemblies in 1805
to discuss supporting Maratha prince Jaswant Rao Holkar against the British.
Initial phase
Initially, the Sarbat Khalsa appointed the Akal Takht Jathedar during annual gatherings.
After British rule, the Darbar Sahib committee, influenced by regime-loyal leaders, controlled the appointments.
Role of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC)
With the Sikh Gurdwaras Act of 1925, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), established in 1920, took over the responsibility.
Today, the SGPC governs Sikh gurdwaras in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Chandigarh.
The Authority of the Akal Takht Jathedar
Power
The Jathedar of the Akal Takht is the supreme temporal and religious authority of the Sikh community, holding the final say on its affairs.
The position requires the individual to be baptized, well-versed in Sikh history and scriptures, and free from moral flaws.
Jurisdiction
The Akal Takht can summon any self-identifying Sikh for trial and sentencing, with its justice applying only to those who voluntarily accept its authority.
Religious punishments (tankhah) aim to instill humility by removing ego.
No one has ever defied its directives
As per the historians, no one has ever defied its directive.
A prominent Jathedar demonstrated this authority by summoning Maharaja Ranjit Singh for a moral lapse,
resulting in the Maharaja undergoing public flogging at the Akal Takht
Relationship between the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the SGPC
The Origins of SGPC and SAD
The SGPC and SAD share roots in the Gurdwara Reform Movement of 1920.
The SGPC, established on November 15, 1920, was created to manage Sikh shrines, while the SAD, formed a month later, initially served as its task force to combat corrupt mahants and British interference.
Together,
they institutionalized the Khalsa identity and became central to Sikh religious and political leadership
The Three Pillars of Sikh Politics
The Akal Takht, SGPC, and SAD are described as the “three poles” of Sikh politics by political scientists.
Controlling the SGPC, which appoints the Akal Takht Jathedar, provides the SAD with significant influence due to the SGPC’s electoral structure, comprising 170 elected members out of 191.
Akali Influence Over the SGPC
The SAD dominated the SGPC during the 1960s and 1970s, maintaining control even as Punjab faced unrest in 1979.
However, their influence waned when Gurcharan Singh Tohra became SGPC president in 1973, holding the post for 27 years.
Following Tohra’s demise and the decline of militancy, the Akalis regained control.
Critics argue that the lack of SGPC elections since 2011 has helped SAD maintain its influence.
Influence of SAD on Akal Takht Jathedar Decisions
The SAD’s control over the SGPC has significantly impacted the independence of the Akal Takht Jathedar, with decisions often appearing politically influenced.

**********Windfall gains tax on oil production, diesel-petrol export removed
Why in news?
Recently, the government officially withdrew the windfall gains tax on domestic crude oil production and fuel exports (diesel, petrol, and ATF).
The levy, introduced 30 months ago during a surge in international crude oil and fuel prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, aimed to address global energy turmoil and ensure domestic fuel availability.
What’s in today’s article?
Withdrawal of windfall gains tax
Windfall tax
About
Windfall taxes are designed to tax the profits a company derives from an external, sometimes unprecedented event— for instance, the energy price-rise as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The United States Congressional Research Service defines a windfall as an
unearned, unanticipated gain in income through no additional effort or expense
These are profits that cannot be attributed to something the firm actively did, like an investment strategy or an expansion of business.
Governments typically levy a one-off tax retrospectively over and above the normal rates of tax on such profits, called windfall tax.
Rationale behind levying this tax
Redistribution of unexpected gains when high prices benefit producers at the expense of consumers,
To fund social welfare schemes, and
As a supplementary revenue stream for the government,
As a way for the Centre to narrow the country’s widened trade deficit.
Criticism
Brings uncertainty in the market
Since windfall taxes are imposed retrospectively and are often influenced by unexpected events, they can brew uncertainty in the market about future taxes.
This may affect the future investment in the related sectors.
Populist in nature
Many analysts believe that such taxes are populist and politically opportune in the short term.
The IMF advice note also said that taxes in response to price surges may suffer from design problems—given their expedited and political nature.
Profits earned in such instances are reward for the risk taken
Companies argue that it is the profit they earned as a reward for the industry’s risk-taking to provide the end user with the petroleum product.
Who should be taxed is another issue
Another issue is who should be taxed- only the big companies responsible for the bulk of high-priced sales or smaller companies as well.
This raises the question of whether producers with revenues or profits below a certain threshold should be exempt.
Background - Introduction of Windfall Gains Tax
It was introduced on July 1, 2022, amid a surge in crude oil and fuel prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
It was aimed to address concerns about fuel availability in the domestic market during the global energy turmoil.
Apprehensions about the availability of the fuels in the domestic market amid the global energy turmoil at the time also contributed to the decision to impose the levy.
Windfall gains tax removed
On December 2, 2024, the govt withdrew the windfall gains tax on domestic production of crude oil and export of diesel, petrol, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF).
Decision reflects current global oil market stability and diminished likelihood of another supply shock.
Reasons for Withdrawal
Global Stabilisation
:
Oil and fuel prices significantly reduced (from over $100 to under $75 per barrel).
Supply flows stabilised after initial shocks.
Domestic Market Conditions
Robust fuel availability in the domestic market.
Declining revenue from the tax due to market adjustments.
Scrapping the levy: Impact and signal
Opposition to the Windfall Tax
The oil industry opposed the tax, citing reduced profitability for publicly listed companies and a discouraging environment for increasing oil production.
Frequent changes in levies created unpredictability in taxation, deterring investments in a country heavily reliant on oil imports (85% dependency).
Decline in Revenue Collection
Significant softening of international crude oil and fuel prices had reduced windfall gains tax revenues:
FY23: Rs 25,000 crore.
FY24: Rs 13,000 crore.
FY25 (so far): Rs 6,000 crore.
Impact on Key Stakeholders

**********India's Trade Opportunities Amidst Global Shifts
Why in News?
India's trade landscape is undergoing significant challenges and opportunities due to global economic disruptions and evolving geopolitical tensions.
The recently released
Trade Watch report by NITI Aayog
provides insights into India's trade prospects, challenges, and potential growth areas,
particularly amidst the US-China trade conflict and the 'China Plus One' strategy.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Key Findings of the NITI Aayog’s Trade Watch Report
Geopolitical Shifts and India's Opportunities
Sectoral Challenges and Policy Considerations for India
Recent Developments in India’s Trade Policy
Future Prospects
Conclusion
Key Findings of the NITI Aayog’s Trade Watch Report:
Limited success in the ‘China Plus One’ strategy:
India has had "limited success" in leveraging the 'China Plus One' strategy, where
multinational companies diversify supply chains away from China.
Southeast Asian nations like
Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Cambodia have outpaced India
due to factors such as
cheaper labour, simplified tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)
Trade fragmentation and export control measures:
The US has imposed strict export controls on Chinese goods
, further fragmenting global trade.
India’s key competitors in exports
include Malaysia and Thailand, particularly in sectors like electrical machinery.
Geopolitical Shifts and India's Opportunities:
US-China trade conflict - A double-edged sword:
The escalating US-China trade war, marked by tit-for-tat trade restrictions, offers opportunities for India.
US measures:
Restrictions on exports of high-tech materials to China.
China’s response:
Bans on critical materials like gallium and germanium.
India has a minimal share
(less than 1%) in 70% of global trade, underscoring untapped potential.
NITI Aayog CEO B.V.R. Subrahmanyam emphasised a significant trade boom is possible
if India capitalises on these disruptions.
India-US trade relations:
The US,
India's largest trading partner
, presents immense opportunities for growth in goods and services trade.
Sectoral Challenges and Policy Considerations for India:
Iron and steel industry vulnerabilities:
India's iron and steel
exports saw a sharp 33% decline in Q1 FY25
, driven by weak domestic demand and oversupply in China.
The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (
CBAM
) poses a significant challenge:
Tariffs of 20–35% could reduce competitiveness and demand.
Compliance with emissions reporting will increase costs.
Tariff policies - A balancing act:
Proposed 25% hikes in steel import duties face scrutiny.
Suman Bery, Vice Chairperson of NITI Aayog, warned about lower competition and the ramifications for domestic users.
India’s response must
balance principles and pragmatism
, especially against countries with opaque industry practices and oversupply issues.
Recent Developments in India’s Trade Policy:
Interest Equalisation Scheme:
It aims to provide identified MSME manufacturing exporters a cheaper source of rupee credit for pre-shipment and post-shipment activities to improve product competitiveness in international markets.
The Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP):
It aims to neutralise taxes and duties on exported goods.
Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG):
The scheme allows duty-free import of capital goods aimed at building domestic capacity.
Trade Facilitation:
India scored 93.55% in the 2023 UNESCAP Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade Facilitation (up from 90.32% in 2021), a score surpassing that of several developed countries, including France, UK, Germany, etc.
Trade Connect e-Platform:
A single-window platform to boost international trade for Indian MSME exporters, offering real-time trade info and resources to connect with government and markets.
11th India - New Zealand Joint Trade Committee (JTC) meeting:
Service sector trade was given a special focus, alongside streamlining regulatory and quality checks.
5th meeting of ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement Joint Committee:
The meeting reviewed issues like market access, rules of origin, trade remedies, etc.
Future Prospects:
Impact of Trump’s trade policies:
The general US tariffs on imports (e.g., 10%) would not harm India.
High tariffs on Chinese goods (e.g., 60%) could open significant market opportunities for Indian exporters.
Focus on diversification and market expansion:
India needs to explore new markets and products to increase its global trade share.
Proactive policy measures and reforms could position India as a neutral, connecting economy amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.
Conclusion:
India stands at a crossroads of opportunity and challenge in global trade
. While competitors have seized advantages under the ‘China Plus One’ strategy, India's potential remains untapped in several sectors.
Strategic preparation, diversification of trade partners, and reforms in policy and infrastructure
could enable India to capitalize on emerging opportunities amidst global disruptions.

**********Is the Caste Census a Useful Exercise?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Caste Census (Historical Context, Challenges of Caste Census, Implications, etc.)
Introduction:
The debate around conducting a caste census in India has gained momentum, with proponents arguing for its utility in determining caste populations to allocate resources, reservations, and policy benefits proportionally.
However, historical experiences and current complexities suggest significant challenges in executing such an exercise.
Historical Context:
The history of caste censuses dates back to the colonial era:
1871-72 Census
: The first detailed caste census was conducted, revealing arbitrary and inconsistent classifications across regions.
1931 Census
: Identified 4,147 castes but highlighted inaccuracies as communities claimed different identities in different regions.
Post-Independence
Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011
recorded 46.7 lakh caste categories, with 8.2 crore acknowledged errors, exposing the complexity of caste classification.
Challenges in Conducting a Caste Census:
Caste Mobility and Misclassification
Upward Mobility
: Communities might report affiliation with higher castes for perceived social prestige.
Downward Mobility
: Post-independence, some communities claim lower caste status to benefit from reservations.
Similar-Sounding Castes
: Confusion arises from identical or similar surnames, leading to misclassification (e.g., 'Dhanak', 'Dhanuk', and 'Dhanka' in Rajasthan).
Enumerator Bias
Sensitive nature of caste questions often causes enumerators to make assumptions based on surnames rather than direct inquiries.
Data Accuracy
Historical records and current surveys, such as the
Bihar Caste Census 2022
, reveal inconsistencies, further undermining reliability.
Proportional Representation: A Flawed Approach
The concept of proportional representation in caste-based reservations has been criticized as impractical:
Reservation Mechanism
Reserved seats are distributed proportionally (e.g., every 4th position for OBCs at 27% reservation).
Impracticality
India's population of 1.4 billion includes over 6,000 castes. The average caste size is 2.3 lakh.
Smaller castes, such as those with 10,000 members, would require over 1.4 lakh vacancies to secure one reserved seat, a scale unfeasible in recruitment processes like UPSC.
Implications of a Caste Census:
Policy Implementation
While proponents argue for equitable resource distribution, the data complexities risk exacerbating social divisions.
Exclusion of Minor Castes
Smaller castes risk being excluded due to disproportionately low representation, undermining the objective of inclusivity.
Administrative Burden
A caste census would require massive logistical and financial resources, diverting focus from other pressing developmental priorities.
Conclusion:
While the idea of a caste census is rooted in achieving equity, historical and contemporary evidence highlights significant challenges in execution, data reliability, and fairness.
Alternative approaches that prioritize socio-economic development and inclusivity without exacerbating caste divisions may offer more sustainable solutions.

International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India’s interest in West Africa;
Why in the News?
Despite China’s increasing involvement in financing and infrastructure development, India continues to hold a significant position as one of Nigeria’s key partners in West Africa.
What are the strategic objectives of India in West Africa?
Strengthening Bilateral Relations:
India aims to enhance its strategic partnership with Nigeria, which is pivotal as Nigeria is both the largest economy and democracy in Africa. This partnership is expected to extend beyond Nigeria, influencing broader regional dynamics in West Africa.
Focus on Security Cooperation:
Given the challenges of terrorism, piracy, and drug trafficking in Nigeria, India seeks to bolster security cooperation. This includes defence collaboration and joint efforts in counterterrorism operations against groups like Boko Haram.
Development Partnerships:
India positions itself as a development partner by providing concessional loans and capacity-building programs, demonstrating a commitment to supporting Nigeria’s socio-economic growth.
Promotion of Global South Aspirations:
Both India and Nigeria share common goals as leaders of the Global South, aiming to amplify their voices in international forums like the UN Security Council.
How does India plan to enhance its economic ties with West African countries?
Diversifying Trade Relations:
India plans to revitalize trade with Nigeria, which has seen a decline recently. Efforts include negotiating trade agreements such as the Economic Cooperation Agreement (ECA) and the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) to facilitate investment and trade.
Sectoral Collaboration:
The focus areas for economic collaboration include defence, energy, technology, health, and education. India’s PM discussions with the President of Nigeria emphasized leveraging India’s expertise in these sectors to foster mutual growth.
Infrastructure Development:
India aims to support infrastructure development through concessional loans and technical assistance, building on existing projects that have benefited from Indian investment.
Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges:
Enhancing cultural ties and promoting exchanges between citizens are also part of India’s strategy to strengthen bilateral relations, fostering goodwill and mutual understanding.
What challenges does India face in its engagement with West Africa?
Geopolitical Competition:
India’s engagement is challenged by China’s significant presence in Nigeria, where Chinese companies dominate various sectors including infrastructure and telecommunications. This competition complicates India’s efforts to establish itself as a key partner.
Economic Fluctuations:
The decline in trade between India and Nigeria from $14.95 billion in 2021-22 to $7.89 billion in 2023-24 highlights vulnerabilities due to shifting global oil markets and increasing imports from other countries like Russia.
Political Instability:
The political landscape in Nigeria can be unpredictable, posing risks for long-term investments and cooperation initiatives that require stability for successful implementation.
Capacity Constraints:
While India offers developmental assistance, the effectiveness of these initiatives can be hindered by local capacity constraints in Nigeria, necessitating a tailored approach that considers local needs and capabilities.
Way forward:
Deepen Strategic Collaboration
: Strengthen defence and security partnerships, diversify trade, and enhance collaboration in sectors like energy, technology, and health to counter China’s growing influence and foster mutual growth.
Focus on Regional Capacity Building
: Expand developmental assistance with tailored initiatives addressing local needs, while supporting Nigeria’s stability through diplomatic engagement and joint Global South aspirations in international forums.
Mains PYQ:
Increasing interest of India in Africa has its pros and cons. Critically Examine.

**********Why some PLI schemes are in the slow lane?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of PLI Scheme;
Why in the News?
Six
out of the
14 Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes
, including textiles, solar modules, IT hardware, automobiles, advanced chemical cells (ACC), and speciality steel, are progressing at a
relatively slower pace.
What are the primary reasons for the slow implementation of PLI schemes?
Stringent Eligibility Norms:
Many industries have reported that the eligibility criteria for participation in PLI schemes are too stringent, which limits the number of companies that can benefit from the incentives.
Initial Setup Challenges:
Establishing a domestic manufacturing base from scratch is a monumental task. Industries such as solar modules and advanced chemistry cells (ACC) require substantial time—ranging from one-and-a-half to three years—to set up manufacturing operations, delaying employment generation.
Access to Resources:
Companies face difficulties in accessing critical resources, including Chinese machinery and skilled technicians, which can hinder their ability to ramp up production quickly.
Market Dependency:
Some sectors remain heavily reliant on imports and have not yet transitioned to a self-sufficient manufacturing model, impacting their growth under the PLI framework.
Slow Disbursement of Funds:
The initial years of the scheme saw minimal disbursement of funds, with only a small percentage of the total incentive outlay being paid out in the first two years.
Which sectors are experiencing the most significant slowdowns, and why?
Textiles:
This sector is struggling due to high competition and stringent norms that have slowed down participation and growth.
Solar Modules:
Despite being a strategic sector for renewable energy, delays in establishing manufacturing capabilities have led to slow progress.
As of June 2024, India’s solar module manufacturing capacity reached 77.2 GW, but the solar cell capacity was only 7.6 GW, leading to supply shortages that delayed projects.
Automobiles:
While some companies are making progress, the automobile sector overall is hindered by initial setup challenges and fluctuating market conditions
Factors such as rising raw material costs and shifts in consumer preferences towards electric vehicles are creating a complex environment for traditional automakers.
Advanced Chemical Cells (ACC):
Similar to solar modules, this sector faces long commissioning periods that delay employment outcomes. Because of the lengthy development timelines for manufacturing facilities and the need for substantial investment in technology are contributing to slower growth in this strategic area.
IT Hardware:
Although recently upgraded with increased funding, it still lags behind in implementation compared to more successful sectors like mobile manufacturing.
What measures can be taken to enhance the effectiveness of PLI schemes? (Way forward)
Revising Eligibility Criteria:
Simplifying the eligibility requirements could encourage more companies, especially smaller firms, to participate in the schemes and benefit from incentives.
Increasing Support for Supply Chains:
Establishing robust supply chains is crucial. The government could provide additional support to smaller suppliers who are essential for scaling up production across sectors.
Streamlining Resource Access:
Facilitating easier access to necessary machinery and skilled labor can help companies ramp up production more effectively and reduce dependency on imports.
Regular Reviews and Adjustments:
Continuous monitoring and adjustments based on sector performance can help identify bottlenecks early and allow for timely interventions.
Encouraging Ancillary Industries:
Promoting the establishment of ancillary industries around larger beneficiaries could create additional jobs and enhance local manufacturing capabilities.
Mains PYQ:
Can the strategy of regional-resource-based manufacturing help in promoting employment in India?

**********What is Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
The
Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
began its
three-day monetary policy review
.
There is increasing speculation that the RBI may announce a
cut in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
to ease liquidity pressures.
CRR is the percentage of a bank’s
total deposits
that it must maintain as
liquid cash
with the
as a reserve.
It is a tool used by the
to manage
inflation
and
check excessive lending
by banks.
It serves as a
safety net
during times of banking stress, ensuring banks have enough liquidity for day-to-day operations.
As of now, the CRR is set at
4.5%
Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL)
Banks do not earn interest
on the amount they maintain as CRR with the RBI.
CRR Requirements for Different Types of Banks:
Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs)
: Includes Public Sector Banks (PSBs), Private Sector Banks (PVBs), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Small Finance Banks (SFBs), Payments Banks, Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs), State Co-operative Banks (StCBs), and District Central Co-operative Banks (DCCBs).
Non-Scheduled Co-operative Banks & Local Area Banks
: They must maintain CRR with themselves or with the RBI.
Restrictions on CRR Funds
Banks cannot
the funds held as CRR to
corporates or individual borrowers
The money held under CRR cannot be used for
investment purposes
by the bank.
No Interest
is earned on the funds maintained as CRR by banks with the RBI.
Incremental CRR (I-CRR)
Introduced temporarily on
August 10, 2023
, to absorb surplus liquidity in the banking system.
Banks were required to maintain
10% I-CRR
increase in their NDTL
between
May 19, 2023
July 28, 2023
The I-CRR was implemented from
August 12, 2023
, and applied during periods of
excess liquidity
in the financial system.
Impacts of Declining CRR on the Economy
Positive Impacts:
Increased Bank Liquidity
: A reduction in CRR frees up more funds for banks, improving
credit availability
and promoting investment and consumption.
Stimulus for Economic Growth
: With more funds to lend, businesses can secure loans more easily, boosting
economic activity
and encouraging growth across sectors.
Lower Interest Rates
: As banks have more liquidity, they may lower interest rates on loans, making
credit cheaper
and encouraging investment and consumer spending.
Negative Impacts:
Potential Inflationary Risks
: Increased lending and spending can raise
demand
, which, if not matched by supply, can lead to
inflationary pressures
in the economy.
Asset Bubbles
: Excess liquidity may result in overvalued
assets
like stocks or real estate, creating the risk of
unsustainable price increases
and potential market instability.
PYQ:
[2010]
When the Reserve Bank of India announces an increase of the Cash Reserve Ratio, what does it mean?
(a) The commercial banks will have less money to lend
(b) The Reserve Bank of India will have less money to lend
(c) The Union Government will have less money to lend
(d) The commercial banks will have more money to lend
