INDIA’S ILLEGAL COAL MINING PROBLEM
Syllabus
Mains – GS 2 & GS 3
Context:
Recently, three workers died of asphyxiation inside an illegal coal mine in Gujarat’s Surendranagar district.
Background:
The Surendranagar incident is not an isolated case. In June 2023, an illegal mine collapse in the Dhanbad district of Jharkhand tragically claimed the lives of three people, including a ten-year-old child. Similarly, in October 2023, at least three individuals perished in Paschim Bardhaman district, West Bengal, due to a coal mine collapse during illegal extraction.
About Coal mining in India
Coal in India was nationalised in two phases: first with the coking coal (used for the production of coke in the steel industry) in 1971-72; and then with the non-coking coal mines in 1973.
The Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 is the central legislation that determines eligibility for coal mining in India.
Illegal mining constitutes a law and order problem, which is a State list subject. Hence, the onus of dealing with it falls on State governments.
Why is illegal coal mining rampant in India?
According to the Ministry of Coal, illegal mining in India is mostly carried out in abandoned mines or shallow coal seams in remote or isolated places.
Several factors contribute to illegal coal mining in India:
Coal, the most abundant fossil fuel in India, meets 55% of the country’s energy needs. The high demand for power often exceeds the legal supply of coal, leading to illegal mining.
Coal-rich areas are often near impoverished communities, leading to illegal mining due to poverty and unemployment.
In remote areas, inadequate monitoring and lack of resources lead to weak enforcement of regulations. This fosters the rise of “coal mafias,” as seen in multiple illegal coal mining cases in India. For instance, in 2018, activist Marshall Biam of the North East Indigenous People’s Federation accused a “police-backed” coal gang of threatening him. Mining tragedies are common in coal-rich Meghalaya.
Illegal coal mining often receives tacit support from political leaders, making it difficult to curb. Despite a 2014 NGT ban, illegal rat-hole mining persists in Assam, Meghalaya, and other northeastern states, allegedly with political and official collusion.
Illegal mining often employs rudimentary techniques like surface mining and rat-hole mining instead of the scientific methods used in legal operations. In areas with shallow coal seams, illegal miners use limited safety equipment. The low operational costs and high profits make illegal mining lucrative.
Illegal coal mining is not new; it predates coal nationalization. In many areas, local economies depend on mining, and when official mining operations end, illegal mining supports the community.

KARGIL VIJAY DIWAS
Prelims & Mains – SECURITY ISSUES
Kargil Vijay Diwas, observed annually on 26th July, commemorates India’s victory over Pakistan and honors the sacrifices of soldiers who overcame immense challenges to achieve victory in Kargil.
Background:-
India’s hard-fought victory in the Kargil War illustrated the timeless challenges posed by combat at high altitude – challenges which are as deadly, if not more, than the enemy itself.
The Kargil War
The conflict began when Pakistani infiltrators crossed the LoC and occupied high positions in Kargil, Ladakh. Initially reported to the Indian Army on May 3, these infiltrators were thought to be jihadists. However, over the following weeks, the scale of the invasion revealed undeniable involvement by the Pakistani state.
Between mid-May and July, the Indian forces slowly recaptured critical positions from the Pakistanis, in the face of heavy casualties. The Army announcing the complete withdrawal of all Pakistani regular and irregular troops from Kargil on July 26.
Beyond the enemy infiltrators, who were well-armed and supported by non-stop shelling from the Pakistani side, the conditions of Kargil were a challenge in and of themselves.
Trial by altitude
Kargil is located at the northern edge of the LoC, some 200 km northeast of Srinagar and 230 km west of Leh. Kargil town lies at an altitude of 2,676 m (8,780 ft), Dras lies at a height of 3,300 m (10,800 ft), and the surrounding peaks rise to altitudes of 4,800 m (16,000 ft) to 5,500 m (18,000 ft).
These extreme heights cause severe physiological effects on the one’s body — and equipment.
The first challenge was the crippling cold. The battlefield in Kargil lay in a cold desert where winter temperatures dropped to as low as -30 degrees Celsius. Even in summer, frigid winds and a barren landscape made it inhospitable. The cold affected both men and machines, with guns jamming and soldiers expending great energy to stay warm.
The second challenge was the thin air and reduced oxygen levels, causing acute mountain sickness (AMS) among soldiers, with symptoms like headaches, nausea, and fatigue. This low air pressure weakened soldiers and impacted weapon and aircraft performance. While it increased projectile range, accuracy suffered, and aircraft engines produced less power, with helicopters experiencing reduced rotor efficiency.
Lastly, the terrain  imposed significant restrictions on soldiers. It reduced mobility, provided cover to the enemy, and limited the scope of operations. During the Kargil War, the Indian Army was at a particular disadvantage with the enemy occupying high positions overlooking the positions held by Indians.
Victory against all odds
Against relentless enemy fire and unforgiving conditions, the Indian Army freed Kargil’s peaks of Pakistani intruders.
The early stages of the war revealed crucial lessons, as both the Army and Air Force found themselves unprepared for large-scale high-altitude combat. Many soldiers suffered from AMS, leading to some casualties, and inadequate cold-weather gear posed additional challenges. Meanwhile, the difficult terrain and Pakistan’s persistent shelling of NH 1A created significant logistical issues.
The Army adapted its methods to address these challenges by implementing acclimatization and training programs for soldiers. Improved cold-weather equipment was procured, though shortages persisted. High-altitude assault techniques were refined, shifting from daytime frontal attacks to small groups scaling near-vertical terrain.
The Army’s key strategy involved combining overwhelming firepower with daring maneuvers. Massive artillery barrages preceded all attacks. Given limitations of providing air cover to the ground forces due to the altitude and the terrain, the Army relied heavily on artillery, particularly the Bofors gun, whose range nearly doubled in Kargil’s thin air.

DARK OXYGEN
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
Researchers have discovered “dark oxygen” being produced in the deep ocean.
The recent study published in Nature Geoscience, a journal dedicated to Earth sciences research, shows oxygen emitted from mineral deposits 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet) below the ocean’s surface on the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean’s Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ).
Key takeaways
Oxygen is essential for life on Earth, and we’ve long associated it with photosynthesis—the process by which plants and algae produce oxygen using sunlight.
However, recent discovery challenge this understanding. Scientists have found evidence of an additional source of oxygen called dark oxygen.
What Is Dark Oxygen?:
Dark oxygen is produced deep under the sea without sunlight.
Polymetallic nodules, which are naturally occurring mineral masses found on the ocean floor, play a crucial role in this newly discovered process. These nodules, made up of metals like manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and lithium, can generate oxygen through electrochemical activity even in the absence of light.
Implications and Significance:
Until now, we believed that all oxygen came from photosynthetic organisms (plants and algae).
Dark oxygen challenges this notion, suggesting that there might be alternative oxygen sources.
It raises intriguing questions about the origins of life on Earth.
Where Did Dark Oxygen Come From?:
Scientists discovered dark oxygen at a depth of 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet) below the ocean’s surface , specifically from the pacific ocean’s Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ).
The fact that it’s produced without sunlight implies that life might have existed before photosynthesis emerged.

GREENIUM
Prelims – ECONOMY
: Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran recently said that private investors need to “walk the talk” on prioritising sustainable investments citing the low “greenium” from them on India’s sovereign green bond offerings.
Chief Economic Advisor’s statement highlights an important challenge faced by India and other countries: encouraging private investors to actively support sustainable projects.
About GREENIUM :
The term greenium, also known as the green premium, refers to a pricing benefit associated with green bonds.
The greenium represents the difference in yield between a green bond and a conventional bond issued by the same entity.
Green bonds typically offer lower interest rates (yields) compared to traditional government securities (like regular government bonds).
Investors are willing to accept these lower yields because of the appeal of sustainability. They prioritize supporting environmentally friendly projects.
Long-term green projects are associated with reduced physical and financial risk. Investors are willing to settle for lower returns due to this reduced risk.
As a result, issuers benefit from the cost savings (the greenium) on coupon payments for green bonds.
Green Bonds:
Green bonds are debt instruments issued by governments, corporations, or other entities to fund specific projects or activities that have positive environmental impacts.
These projects are categorized as “green” based on national or international green taxonomies.
Examples include renewable energy projects, electric buses, and energy-efficient initiatives.

**********Listeria outbreaks in the US and Canada
Why in news?
Two separate outbreaks of listeria, a bacteria that can contaminate food, have been reported recently in the United States and Canada.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced an outbreak on July 19, affecting 12 states and linked to the consumption of undercooked meats sliced at deli counters. This outbreak has resulted in two deaths and 28 hospitalizations.
(The CDC says, w
hen two or more people get the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink, the event is called a
foodborne disease outbreak
.)
In Canada, a public health notice on July 17 reported 12 cases of listeria, with two resulting in deaths. Both countries are responding to these outbreaks to prevent further spread of the infection.
What’s in today’s article?
About
Listeria or Listeria monocytogenes is a type of bacteria found in soil, vegetation, water, sewage and even the faeces of animals and humans.
Listeria-contaminated food can lead to an infection called listeriosis
Symptoms of listeriosis
Most people who ingest listeria-infected food do not fall sick or develop symptoms.
The bacteria can be present in the infected person’s system for up to two months until the symptoms present themselves, making it difficult to establish the connection between what was consumed and the infection.
Symptoms include vomiting, nausea, cramps, severe headache, constipation and fever.
Vulnerability
People with compromised immune systems, pregnant persons and their offspring and the elderly (aged 65 and above) are vulnerable.
The US outbreak has a median age of 75.
Listeria can result in hospitalisation and even death for the immunocompromised and the elderly.
Pregnant women are 10 times more likely to develop a listeria infection and risk pregnancy loss, premature birth or even life-threatening infection in the newborn.
Some foods are more likely to have listeria than others, including milk, raw sprouts, deli meats and hot dogs, soft cheeses and smoked seafood.
Treatment for listeriosis
Treatment depends on the extent of the infection. In many cases, intestinal listeriosis manifests within a day or two of consuming the contaminated food item and may lead to diarrhoea and vomiting.
The treatment is similar to one for a routine stomach infection and could require antibiotics.
If the infection spreads beyond the intestines, it leads to invasive listeriosis. Severe symptoms present themselves two weeks after the food has been consumed.

**********States have right to levy tax on mineral rights
Why in news?
A nine-judge bench in the Supreme Court has ruled by majority that states have legislative competence to levy taxes on minerals and mineral-bearing lands in addition to the royalty imposed by the Centre.
The case,
Mineral Area Development Authority v M/s Steel Authority of India
, which had been pending for more than a quarter century, was decided by an 8-1 split.
Through the judgment, the court clarified that the
royalty charged on mining activities is not a tax
; instead, it is considered a form of contractual payment made by miners to the Central government for the extraction of minerals.
This decision reinforces the states' power to generate revenue from mineral resources while maintaining the contractual nature of the royalty payments to the Centre.
What’s in today’s article?
Background
Key highlights of the recent judgement
Mining and Royalties
Royalties refer to the fees paid to the owner of a product in exchange for the right to use that product.
E.g., if a movie studio wants to use an existing piece of music by a specific artist in their new film, they will have to pay a royalty fee that goes to the artist.
The issue of whether royalties on mining activities constitute a tax has been a longstanding legal question in India.
Under Section 9 of the
Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDRA),
entities holding mining leases are required to pay royalties to the owner of the land, which could be a state government.
This raised the question of
whether these royalties are a form of tax when the state is the lessor
The Supreme Court first addressed this question in the 1989
The Supreme Court first addressed this question in the 1989 case
India Cement Ltd v State of Tamil Nadu
A seven-judge Bench heard a challenge by the company to a Tamil Nadu law imposing a cess on land revenues, including royalties.
A cess is a form of tax levied by the government on tax with specific purposes till the time the government gets enough money for that purpose.
The court ruled that while states can collect royalties, they cannot impose taxes on mining activities, as the
Central government has overriding authority
over the regulation of mines and mineral development under
Entry 54 of the Union List
In this judgement, the apex court opined that
royalty is a tax
, and as such a cess on royalty being a tax on royalty, is beyond the competence of the State Legislature.
The court controversially stated, "royalty is a tax," leading to questions about the interpretation of royalties as a tax.
2004 case State of West Bengal v Kesoram Industries Ltd
This statement sparked further legal debate and confusion, leading to the 2004 case State of West Bengal v Kesoram Industries Ltd.
Here, a five-judge Constitution Bench identified a
typographical error in the India Cement decision
, clarifying that it should have stated "cess on royalty is a tax" rather than "royalty is a tax."
The court held that royalties themselves are not taxes but could not overrule the India Cement decision
due to the smaller size of the bench
2011 Mineral Area Development Authority case
In 2011, during the Mineral Area Development Authority case, the Supreme Court noted the conflict between the Kesoram Industries and India Cement rulings.
Recognizing the direct implications for the case at hand, the court referred the
matter to a nine-judge bench to conclusively determine whether royalties are a form of tax
This led to the recent clarification by the nine-judge bench that royalties are not taxes but contractual payments, thus resolving the long-standing ambiguity.
Majority held that a royalty is not a tax
The majority held that a royalty is not a tax because there is a conceptual difference between royalties and taxes.
Royalties are based on specific contracts or agreements between the mining leaseholder and the lessor (the person who leases the property) who can even be a private party.
Also, taxes are meant for public purposes such as welfare schemes and creating public infrastructure.
On the other hand, the payment of royalties is to a lessor in exchange “for parting with their exclusive privileges in the minerals”.
States have the power to tax ‘mineral development
The Supreme Court considered:
whether states have the authority to tax mineral development activities;
or if such taxes fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Central government under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDRA).
This issue arises from the provisions in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.
The State List grants States the exclusive power to legislate on “taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development” (Entry 50).
Conversely,
gives the Central government the power to regulate mines and mineral development.
It empowers the Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest.
According to the earlier India Cement decision, royalties collected by states under the MMDRA were considered a form of tax, precluding states from imposing additional taxes.
However, the court in the Mineral Area Development Authority case determined that royalties are not taxes.
This meant that
royalties do not fall under “taxes on mineral rights” as per Entry 50 of the State List
The court concluded that while the MMDRA provides states with royalties as a revenue stream, it does not restrict states from imposing taxes under Entry 50.
Furthermore, the court clarified that Parliament’s authority under Entry 54 does not extend to imposing taxes, as that power belongs solely to state legislatures.
However, Parliament can impose “any limitations,” including prohibitions, on states’ taxing powers under Entry 50.
The court also recognized that states have the power to tax the land where mines and quarries are located, as this includes:
all types of lands; and
covers everything under or over land.
Such taxes are not affected by the MMDR Act, thereby affirming states’ rights to levy taxes related to mineral development activities.
Dissent by Justice Nagarathna
Justice Nagarathna dissented from the majority opinion in the Supreme Court's ruling regarding royalties and the taxation of mineral development activities.
She argued that royalties under the MMDRA should be considered a tax to promote mineral development in India.
According to her, the primary goal of the MMDRA is to encourage mineral development and mining activities.
Allowing states to impose additional levies and cesses on top of the royalties would undermine this objective.
Justice Nagarathna further opined that the passage of the MMDRA effectively reduced the states' powers to impose taxes on mineral development.
She stated that the Act grants states the ability to collect royalties, which she views as a form of tax, while providing Parliament and the Central government with comprehensive control over mineral development.

**********India's Illegal Coal Mining Problem
Why in the News?
On July 13, three workers died of asphyxiation in an illegal coal mine near Bhet village in Gujarat’s Surendranagar district. The workers were not equipped with helmets, masks, or other safety gear. An FIR revealed that the accused failed to provide essential safety equipment, leading to the workers inhaling toxic gas. The police have charged four individuals with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About India’s Coal Reserves
Illegal Coal Mining (Reasons, Challenges, etc.)
Conclusion
India’s Coal Reserves:
India holds
fifth-largest coal reserves in the world
Commercial coal-mining industry has been in operation since 1774, launched by the East India Company along the Damodar River in West Bengal.
70 per cent of India’s coal supply comes from the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.
State-owned
Coal India Limited
has a virtual monopoly on coal mines in India, which produce roughly 75 per cent of the coal burned in India’s coal-fired power stations.
Why Illegal Coal Mining is Rampant in India?
Illegal coal mining persists in India due to a combination of economic, social, political, and regulatory factors.
Despite efforts to curb this activity, several key elements contribute to its prevalence:
High Demand for Coal:
Coal is essential for 55% of India’s energy needs
The legal supply often falls short of demand, leading to an illegal supply chain.
Economic Necessity:
Coal-rich areas often coincide with regions facing poverty and unemployment.
Illegal mining provides an income source for local populations.
Weak Regulation and Enforcement:
Remote mining areas suffer from inadequate monitoring and resource allocation.
Poor enforcement leads to the rise of "coal mafias" controlling illegal mining activities.
Political Complicity:
Allegations of political support for illegal mining are common.
Political figures have been accused of backing illegal operations, making eradication difficult.
Rudimentary Mining Techniques:
Illegal operations use basic methods like surface and rat-hole mining.
Minimal operational costs turn into significant profits, attracting more illegal miners.
Safety and Health Hazards:
Lack of safety equipment and protocols leads to frequent worker fatalities.
Poor structural support in illegal mines increases the risk of cave-ins and toxic exposure.
Challenges in Reducing Illegal Coal Mining:
Jurisdictional Issues:
Law enforcement is a state responsibility, leading to blame-shifting between state and central governments.
Economic Dependencies:
Local economies in coal-rich areas depend heavily on mining activities.
When legal mines close, illegal mining often continues to support the community.
Complex Legal Framework:
The intricate legal system governing mining can lead to bureaucratic inefficiencies.
This complexity makes it easier for illegal mining to persist.
Conclusion:
Illegal coal mining in India is a multifaceted issue driven by high demand, economic necessity, weak enforcement, political support, and safety negligence.
The challenge is exacerbated by jurisdictional and legal complexities, making it a persistent problem despite regulatory efforts.
Addressing these root causes is essential for effectively combating illegal coal mining in the country.

**********MSDE Revamps Model Skill Loan Scheme
Why in News?
The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) revamped the ‘model skill loan scheme’ for skill development courses, with a fresh maximum loan limit of ₹7.5 lakh.
The earlier (launched in 2015) Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Skill Development (CGFSSD) had a maximum loan limit of ₹1.5 lakh.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Challenges Faced by the CGFSSD
Need for a Revamped Model Skill Loan Scheme
The Revamped Model Skill Loan Scheme
Challenges Faced by the CGFSSD:
Low fund utilisation under the scheme:
As on March 31, 2024, loans amounting to ₹115.75 crore had been extended to just 10,077 borrowers. This was mainly due to low ticket size of loans (upto ₹1.5 lakh).
Inflation:
As course costs and fees rose due to inflation, many of the high-cost courses were left out of the scheme.
Less number of lending institutions:
Only member lending institutes of the Indian Banking Association (IBA) were allowed to lend earlier, and there was low uptake by both private and public sector banks due to their limited reach.
Need for a Revamped Model Skill Loan Scheme:
To fill the skill gap:
Only 5% of the so-called skilled workforce is formally skilled and hence there is a huge skilling gap that needs to be filled.
Adapting to rapid technological and societal shifts:
As India (and the world) is undergoing rapid technological and societal shifts, India’s education systems and job market must adapt to keep pace and work hard towards a vision for 2047.
To integrate new-age learning:
As the
'Skill Economy' is increasingly market-led
, new-age learning must be integrated into the skill development ecosystem.
The Revamped Model Skill Loan Scheme:
Background:
In her Budget 2024-25 speech, the Finance Minister had announced the model skill loan scheme.
About the scheme:
The scheme is aimed at
providing easy access to advanced-level skill courses
, which potentially pose a significant financial barrier for many deserving students and candidates to gain futuristic and in-demand industry skills.
The scheme empowers youth
with financial support for advanced skilling, through the instrument of
collateral-free loans up to ₹7.5 lakh
How is it an upgrade over the earlier scheme?
The maximum ticket size
of individual loans eligible for credit guarantee cover has been increased to ₹7.50 lakhs from the earlier limit of ₹1.50 lakhs.
Under the new scheme,
the lending network has been broadened
from only IBA banks to include Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and small finance banks.
The revised scheme will now
allow access to more skill courses
, against only national skill qualification framework (NSQF)-aligned courses under the old scheme.
Also, non-NSQF courses that are on boarded on the Skill India Digital Hub platform will come under the scheme.
Significance:
By ensuring uninterrupted credit flow in the skilling sector and by providing low-income youths with access to affordable finance for specialised skill courses,
this scheme is expected to help 25,000 students every year
With the help of this initiative, aspiring candidates can choose from a plethora of skill courses in sectors such as
healthcare, IT, AI-data science, cloud application, digital marketing
, gaming, drone technology, etc.
These courses, driven by changing industry dynamics, offer substantial
placement opportunities
and potential for
international mobility
