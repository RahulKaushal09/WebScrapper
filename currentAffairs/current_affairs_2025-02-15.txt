Indirect Prompt Injection
Recently, researchers warned that AI chatbots vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks.
About Indirect Prompt Injection:
It is a technique that
manipulates chatbots
into executing
malicious commands.
It exploits the inherent nature of
large language models
(LLMs) to follow instructions embedded within the content they process.
By embedding malicious instructions within seemingly benign documents or emails, attackers can induce chatbots to perform unauthorised actions, such as
searching for sensitive information or altering long-term memory settings.

**********What is Alzheimer’s Disease?
In a new research published in the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia, scientists have found a single cause of development of Alzheimer’s disease, and that is the formation of stress granules.
About Alzheimer’s Disease:
It is a
neurological disorder
slowly destroys memory and thinking skills
and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks.
It is the
most common cause of dementia
, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life.
It accounts for
60-80% of dementia cases.
It involves
parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language.
The condition
usually affects people aged 65 years and over
, with only 10% of cases occurring in people younger than this.
Cause
: The
exact cause
of Alzheimer's disease is
not fully understood
, but it is
believed to be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.
Symptoms:
The early signs of the disease include
forgetting recent events or conversations.
Over time, it
progresses to serious memory problems
and loss of the ability to perform everyday tasks.
On average, a person with Alzheimer's lives four to eight years after diagnosis
but can live as long as 20 years, depending on other factors.
Treatment
: There’s
no cure
for Alzheimer’s, but certain medications and therapies can help manage symptoms temporarily.

**********Corruption Perceptions Index
According to the Transparency International report India ranked 96 out of 180 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) for 2024.
About
Corruption Perceptions Index:
It is the most widely used global corruption ranking in the world. It is published annually by the non-governmental organisation
Transparency International since 1995.
It is an index which ranks countries "by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys."
It generally defines corruption as an "
abuse of entrusted power for private gain".
It uses a
scale of zero to 100,
where “zero” is highly corrupt and “100” is very clean.
It measures how corrupt each country’s public sector is perceived to be, according to experts and business people.
The score for each country is derived from a minimum
of three data sources
, selected from 13 distinct corruption surveys and assessments. These sources are gathered by a range of reputed organisations, such as the
World Bank and the World Economic Forum.
Highlights of
Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) for 2024:
The index, which lists countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, ranked
Denmark at the top
, followed by Finland, and Singapore.
This year’s Index highlighted the
connection between climate action and corruption
, linking it to the broader theme of climate financing.
It gave India a
CPI score of 38.
In 2023, India’s overall score was 39 while in 2022, it was 40. There is a decline in the score of India on CPI. In the Asia-Pacific region, the average score for the region has dropped by one point to 44 as the countries are still failing to deliver on anti-corruption pledges.
Corruption not only undermines development in a country but is also a key cause of declining democracy, instability, and human rights violations as highlighted by the report.

**********Foetus in Foetu
Recently, doctors at the Buldhana District Women’s Hospital in Maharashtra detected a rare case of “foetus in foetu” in a pregnant woman.
About Foetus in Foetu:
It is a rare
congenital disorder
which is also known as
It is a foetus-like mass
developed within the body of the other foetus
in a monozygotic twin pregnancy.
Basically, one twin is very underdeveloped and enwrapped inside the body of the other twin, so much so that the pregnancy is considered a singleton pregnancy.
The presence of a twin inside the body of the other
twin may go undetected for years
. In this case, the condition was discovered during a routine pregnancy scan itself. The woman delivered the baby by a C-section delivery.
This condition occurs when a malformed foetus develops inside another foetus.
It affects about one in 500,000 births. Less than 200 cases have been reported worldwide, with about 10 to 15 cases in India.
Causes of Foetus in Foetu:
The exact cause of this condition
is not fully understood
, but it’s believed to result from an
anomaly during the development of monozygotic
or identical twins.
About 10 to 15 days after the conception of monozygotic twins, the cell mass of the embryo may be split unevenly, due to which one twin is smaller and incompletely formed with the other twin fully developed.
The smaller twin gets trapped within the larger twin. The trapped twin is
considered “parasitic,”
as it draws its blood supply and nutrients from the other
“host” twin.
trapped or “parasitic twin”
has some morphologic features of a normal foetus such as an umbilical cord-like structure, a bag of membranes surrounding it, and blood vessel connections to the host twin. It may have a vertebral column, limbs, and a few organs but lacks vital organs like the brain, heart or gut. Despite having “living tissue,” the parasitic twin has no prospects of independent existence outside the host twin.
The presence of the parasitic twin
affects the health of the host twin
, who has to “feed” the former from the nutrients received over a single umbilical cord. In addition, enlargement of the trapped parasitic twin may compress vital organs in the host and cause discomfort or life-threatening complications.
Generally, the
parasitic twin is found
abdomen of the host twin
. Rarely, it may be found in other organs like the brain or chest.

**********Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and the impact on India
Why in news?
Recently, US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose "reciprocal tariffs" on all countries, with implementation expected after April 1st.
This move could roll back global trade by nearly a century, disregarding existing World Trade Organization agreements. By targeting both allies and adversaries, Trump signals a shift away from established trade norms.
What’s in today’s article?
Reciprocal tariffs
Calculation of Reciprocal Tariffs
Trump Imposing Reciprocal Tariffs – Reasons
Reciprocal tariffs - Impact on India
Tariffs are taxes imposed by an importing country on foreign goods, making them more expensive for domestic consumers.
For example, if a US citizen orders a Banarasi saree from India, US import tariffs will increase its price, affecting affordability.
Higher tariffs slow down global trade by raising costs for all parties involved.
The Move Towards Free Trade
Since World War II, the global economy has shifted toward freer trade, as developed nations agreed that open markets benefit all.
Agreements like GATT and WTO ensured that developing nations received special and differential treatment to protect their industries from stronger economies.
This allowed countries like India to maintain higher tariffs to safeguard local farmers and manufacturers from competition with highly industrialized nations.
Trump’s Shift to Reciprocal Tariffs
Trump’s "reciprocal tariffs" policy seeks to eliminate preferential treatment for any country.
Under this system, the US will impose the same level of tariffs on imports as other nations impose on US exports.
Trump argues this approach is "fair" and removes the need for complex trade agreements, disregarding historical trade arrangements designed to protect developing economies.
The exact calculation method for reciprocal tariffs is still being finalized, with the US trade department expected to determine the final rates for each country by April.
Beyond Simple Tariff Matching
Instead of just mirroring tariff rates, the US plans to consider various subsidies and financial assistance provided by other countries to their exporters.
This means that if a country like India offers subsidies to its industries, the US may factor those into its tariff calculations to create a
"level playing field."
Impact on Developing Countries
If this approach is strictly implemented, developing nations like India, which heavily subsidize exports, will face
on their goods in the US market.
For instance, between 2022 and 2024, India provided $1 billion (₹8,700 crore) in subsidies under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost handset exports.
Since the PLI scheme is essentially a subsidy, it could lead to
higher US tariffs on Indian goods.
Trump’s decision is driven by multiple factors, not just targeting a single country.
While China is the US’s biggest competitor, his initial tariff threats were aimed at close allies like Canada and Mexico.
Targeting Allies and Trade Partners
Trump has criticized the
European Union (EU)
for unfair trade practices against US companies and linked tariffs on
to broader concerns like
illegal immigration
drug exports
into the US.
Trump’s Obsession with Trade Deficits
primary motivation
behind Trump’s tariffs is his strong opposition to
trade deficits
—the gap between imports and exports.
The US trade deficit is nearing
$1 trillion
, while China enjoys a surplus of over
Trump views trade deficits as evidence that the world is
cheating the US
by not playing fair.
How Trump Plans to Eliminate Trade Deficits
Forcing Other Countries to Import More US Goods
– Encouraging nations to buy American products to balance trade.
Compelling Companies to Set Up Manufacturing in the US
– Making it costlier for foreign companies to export to the US, pushing them to establish production units within the country.
Given India's historically high tariffs on US goods, it is expected to be among the nations most affected by Trump's decision.
Bilateral trade (April–Nov 2024): $82.52 billion
India's exports to the US: $52.89 billion
India's imports from the US: $29.63 billion
Trade surplus in India's favour: $23.26 billion
Sectors at Risk
US tariffs could impact key Indian exports, including food products, textiles, clothing, electrical machinery, gems & jewellery, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles.
Increased US Imports
To balance trade, India may
import more US goods
defence equipment, oil, and consumer products
. This could lead to a reduction in India's trade deficit with the US.
Rupee Depreciation
Higher imports from the US would
increase demand for dollars
, leading to a
weaker Indian rupee
against the US dollar.
Impact on Domestic Consumption & GDP Growth
The recent
Rs 1 lakh crore tax break
in India aimed at boosting consumption may lead wealthy Indians to
spend more on US goods
, rather than on Indian products.
limit the expected boost to India's GDP
, as more money flows into the US economy instead.
Long-Term Benefits & Risks
Cheaper US goods
could benefit Indian consumers.
Stronger trade ties with the US could help India’s
economic growth and global positioning
However, this might
undermine Atmanirbhar Bharat
, as more US imports reduce demand for Indian-made products.

**********The Strategic Importance of the Indian Ocean - Insights from the 8th IOC
Context:
, in partnership with
Singapore and Oman
, is hosting the Eighth Indian Ocean Conference (IOC) in
Muscat, Oman
.
Foreign ministers from around 30 countries are attending
to discuss the region’s future.
Historical Significance of the Indian Ocean:
Indian Ocean derived its name
from the historical and civilisational influence that India wielded on the countries of the region.
It served as a crucial trade route
for Indian merchants (like the Manigramam Chettis and Nanadesis) and dynasties like the
Pallavas, Cholas, and Andhras.
Ancient texts like
Kautilya’s Arthashastra
highlighted the importance of maritime activities.
Fa-Hien,
a Chinese traveller, wrote in 415 CE that the ship that took him from Ceylon to Sri Vijaya (present-day Indonesia) had 200 merchants who professed the “Brahmanical religion”.
The Indian Ocean
enabled India’s economic dominance in the first millennium
but was later
controlled by European colonial powers
India’s Neglect of Maritime Power Post-Independence:
The British, despite being naval powers, did not develop India’s maritime strength.
After independence,
India’s focus remained on land-based security
, neglecting its naval potential.
India ranks
20th in global shipbuilding
with only 0.06% market share.
Importance of the Indian Ocean:
Cultural and civilizational connect:
Though discourse on the “Indo-Pacific” dominates the world today, it is a geo-strategic construct, where big power competition is omnipresent.

**********Dealing with China’s Weaponisation of E-supply Chains
Context
Recently China imposed restrictions on the movement of its engineers and technicians working in Foxconn’s Indian facilities
, along with curbs on exports of specialised manufacturing equipment.
These developments
not only threaten India’s aspirations of becoming a global manufacturing powerhouse but also reveal China’s strategic efforts to maintain its dominance
in the electronics supply chain.
Amid these developments,
it is crucial to analyse the underlying factors, economic consequences, and the long-term strategies India needs to adopt in response to these challenges.
China’s Geopolitical Strategy and Supply Chain Domination
China’s recent actions appear to be
part of a broader strategy to exert economic pressure on India by leveraging its dominant position in high-tech manufacturing.
restrictions on Chinese engineers aim to prevent the tacit transfer of knowledge to their Indian counterparts
, thereby slowing the development of India’s manufacturing expertise.
Additionally,
by limiting exports of specialized equipment, over which China holds a near-monopoly, Beijing seeks to delay production timelines
and maintain its leverage in global supply chains.
These measures come at a time when global corporations, including Apple, are diversifying their manufacturing bases beyond China
due to rising trade tensions with the United States and the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The ‘
China Plus One’ strategy
has prompted many companies to explore alternative manufacturing destinations such as India, Vietnam, and Mexico.
Recognising India’s potential as a rising manufacturing hub, China’s restrictions serve as a strategic reminder to global firms of its indispensable role in the electronics industry.
India’s Response to China’s Restrictions and Remaining Challenges
India’s Strategic Investments through the PLI Scheme
India’s commitment to strengthening its electronics manufacturing industry is
evident in the continued focus on the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.
Launched in 2020,
the PLI scheme provides financial incentives to companies for manufacturing mobile phones and electronic components in India.
scheme aims to not only attract global players like Apple but also to stimulate the development of a domestic supply chain
that can reduce India’s dependency on foreign components.
The Indian government has significantly increased its allocation for the PLI scheme
over the years.
In 2025, the allocation rose to ₹8,885 crore ($1.02 billion),
up from ₹6,125 crore ($0.70 billion) in 2024.
or companies like Foxconn, this translates into tangible benefits,
incentivizing them to expand production in India and create jobs in the process.
Dependence on China for Components and Machinery
Despite the growing investments in India’s electronics manufacturing sector, the country still faces a critical challenge:
its heavy reliance on China for essential components and machinery.
hina remains the world’s largest producer of high-tech manufacturing equipment
, including machinery for assembly lines, components like printed circuit boards, camera modules, sensors, and connectors, and critical materials for mobile phones.
This
dependence on Chinese imports has become a significant bottleneck,
particularly when China decides to restrict the flow of these components.
recent curbs imposed by China on the export of specialised manufacturing equipment to India have highlighted this vulnerability.
Without access to these key components
and machines,
India’s manufacturing sector could face substantial delays in production, jeopardizing its ability to scale up
and meet both domestic and global demand.
Moreover,
Foxconn and other contract manufacturers rely heavily on the smooth flow of these Chinese components to maintain their operations in India.
As one of the largest assemblers of Apple’s products,
Foxconn’s ability to ramp up production is directly tied to the availability of these imported parts.
Any disruption to the supply of Chinese-made components
, whether due to restrictions or delays,
could severely impact production timelines and cost structures.
The Role of Foxconn and Apple in India’s Manufacturing Ambitions
Foxconn, a key contract manufacturer for Apple, has been
instrumental in helping India meet its manufacturing goals.
Apple’s decision to expand its production in India
, including the assembly of flagship products like the iPhone 15,
reflects a growing recognition of India as an important player in global electronics manufacturing.
Over the years,
the Indian government has worked diligently to build an attractive environment for foreign direct investment (FDI),
particularly from companies like Foxconn, which have the scale and expertise to drive large-scale manufacturing operations.
India’s southern states
, such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, have emerged as critical hubs for this manufacturing push,
hosting Foxconn’s largest production facilities.
In 2023, Apple’s decision to assemble the iPhone 15 at Foxconn’s facility in Tamil Nadu,
as well as
Tata Electronics’ facility in Karnataka
, marked a
significant milestone for the country.
By
the fiscal year ending in March 2024,
India had assembled approximately $14 billion worth of iPhones through Foxconn and its partners
, including Pegatron and Tata Electronics.
The Way Ahead for India to Build a Self-Sufficient Manufacturing System
The Need for Diversification and Localized Production
The current strategy relies heavily on assembling finished products, but for India to become a true manufacturing powerhouse,
it must focus on developing its own domestic supply chains.
includes encouraging the growth of local component manufacturers
and reducing the reliance on Chinese imports.
One approach would be to
invest in the domestic production of critical components
such as semiconductors, printed circuit boards, and mobile phone batteries.
would not only help shield India from disruptions in the global supply chain but also create high-value jobs
in India’s manufacturing sector.
Strategic Collaboration with Apple and Foxconn
India’s response to China’s restrictions could
also involve deeper collaboration with Apple and Foxconn,
both of which have significant stakes in India’s manufacturing success.
Foxconn, for example, has already invested billions in India
, and its continued presence in the country is vital to India’s long-term ambitions.
India must leverage its partnership with these companies to negotiate with China for more favourable trade terms
, including the easing of restrictions on the export of essential machinery and components.
Apple’s role is also crucial,
as the company’s continued commitment to India is seen as a barometer for the country’s broader manufacturing ambitions.
India, therefore, must ensure that its relationship with Apple and Foxconn remains strong, facilitating the growth of both companies’ operations
while simultaneously building its own indigenous manufacturing capacity.
Conclusion
While India’s efforts to develop a competitive electronics manufacturing sector are commendable, its
dependence on China for key components and machinery remains a significant obstacle.
The restrictions imposed by China on Foxconn’s operations in India serve as a reminder of the vulnerabilities
inherent in global supply chains.
For India to reduce its dependency on China
and build a more self-sufficient manufacturing ecosystem,
it must prioritise local component production, deepen collaboration with foreign companies like Apple and Foxconn.

**********The Teesta Dam and the Long Shadow of Climate Change
Context
recommendation to rebuild the Teesta-3 dam in Sikkim
, following its destruction by a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) in October 2023, has
sparked intense debate.
While the project was previously deemed successful and commercially viable,
its reconstruction raises critical environmental, geological, and socio-economic concerns.
Therefore,
it becomes imperative to examine the factors that led to the Teesta-3 dam’s destruction, expert concerns regarding risk assessment
, and the broader implications for sustainable infrastructure planning in a rapidly changing climate.
The Destruction of Teesta-3: Causes and Consequences
The Teesta-3 hydroelectric dam was
destroyed when a moraine on the South Lhonak lake’s flank suffered a slope failure
, leading to a catastrophic flood.
Satellite data revealed that
approximately 50 billion liters of water spilled into the valley, triggering multiple landslides
and extensive downstream damage.
Over 100 lives were lost, and more than 80,000 people across four districts were affected.
failure of the dam also exacerbated the destruction by amplifying the flood’s intensity
with debris acting as a battering ram.
Subsequent analyses revealed that
the moraine’s instability was a significant contributing factor,
and experts have since monitored the lake for further signs of collapse.
disaster underscored the risks posed by glacial lake expansions,
particularly in the context of climate change and regional geological instability.
Concerns Surrounding the Reconstruction of Teesta-3
Climate Change and the Growing Threat of GLOF
Global warming and increasing particulate pollution,
especially black carbon or soot, have accelerated Himalayan glacier melt.
This
process has led to the formation and expansion of glacial lakes
, increasing the risk of GLOFs.
According to a 2024 report by the Central Water Commission
, the number of glacial lakes and water bodies in the Himalayan region grew by 10.8% between 2011 and 2024
, with their combined surface area increasing by 33.7%.
South Lhonak lake itself expanded significantly since its formation in the 1960s,
reaching 167 hectares by 2023.
Beyond simply increasing water volumes
, glacial retreat also destabilises geological formations, creating new hazards.
unpredictable interactions between melting glaciers, shifting landscapes
, and atmospheric conditions
make it difficult to model future flood risks accurately.
Given this backdrop,
the decision to rebuild the Teesta-3 dam appears questionable,
especially as climate change acts as a risk multiplier, intensifying the frequency and severity of extreme weather events.
Expert Concerns and Limitations of Risk Assessment
Insufficient Model for Capturing the GLOF Dynamics
The expert committee recommending the dam’s reconstruction
justified its decision based on the previous facility’s success and the largely intact condition of its power-generating equipment post-GLOF.
new design incorporates several improvements
, including a fully concrete structure, a spillway nearly three times larger, and an early-warning system.
However, these modifications rely heavily on rainfall-centric models
, which experts argue are
insufficient for capturing the complexities of GLOF dynamics.
Risk Assessment Limitations
2025 assessment by an international team of scientists
from institutions such as IIT Bhubaneswar and IISc Bengaluru
highlighted critical gaps in existing flood models.
Their report stressed that prevailing approaches fail to adequately account for erosion, sediment transport, riverbank collapses
, and hillslope-channel interactions, factors that significantly influence flood behaviour.
Additionally,
Professor Raghu Murtugudde has noted that climate models struggle to accurately represent extreme rainfall events
, further complicating risk assessments.
Given these uncertainties,
many environmental activists and hydrogeologists have raised concerns about the wisdom of rebuilding Teesta-3
in an earthquake- and landslide-prone region.
Public interest litigations have also questioned the dam’s compliance with regulatory norms,
including issues related to Sikkim’s mandated equity share and allegations of corruption.
Necessary Measures to Mitigate the Concerns
Balancing Energy Needs and Climate Risks
India’s growing energy
demand necessitates an expansion of power production, and hydroelectric
projects like Teesta-3 offer a renewable energy source.
However, climate change multiplies risks,
making the siting of such projects a crucial concern.
While Teesta-3’s new design may mitigate damage in the event of a similar flood,
it remains vulnerable to stronger or differently structured floods.
Moreover,
its reconstruction introduces new technological and structural risks
that could lead to unforeseen failure modes.
Critics argue that commercial viability alone should not dictate the decision to rebuild.
Instead, infrastructure planning must prioritise minimizing risks to local communities and maximizing their socio-economic resilience.
This includes ensuring robust disaster preparedness measures, social security frameworks,
and emergency response systems.
A Sustainable Approach to Infrastructure in the Himalayas
The debate surrounding Teesta-3 aligns
with broader discussions on infrastructure sustainability in disaster-prone areas.
Brian Stone Jr., a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has argued that engineering solutions alone cannot counteract climate change;
at some point, retreat becomes inevitable.
If the risks associated with an area continue to rise, either the area itself must be abandoned, or
the costs of maintaining infrastructure must increase significantly.
A more sustainable approach
would involve
integrating climate risk assessment directly into infrastructure planning.
This could include
developing a risk determination matrix
with clear thresholds for unacceptable risk levels.
the costs of disaster preparedness and mitigation should be factored into the hydroelectric power tariff
rather than externalized, ensuring long-term sustainability.
Conclusion
The decision to rebuild the Teesta-3 dam
highlights the complex
intersection of energy needs, environmental risks, and socio-economic considerations.
While the project promises renewable energy and economic benefits,
its location in a geologically unstable, climate-sensitive region raises serious concerns.
As climate change continues to amplify risks,
infrastructure planning must evolve beyond commercial viability to prioritize resilience, risk reduction, and sustainability.

**********[15th February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Dealing with China’s weaponisation of e-supply chains
International Relations
PYQ Relevance:
) The USA is facing an existential threat in the form of China, that is much more challenging than the erstwhile Soviet Union.” Explain.
(UPSC CSE 2021)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
China as a threat to the USA (2021),
and
China is using its economic relations and positive trade surplus as tools
(2017).
In mid-January, reports said China blocked its engineers and technicians from working at Foxconn in India and recalled those already there. It also restricted exports of key manufacturing equipment, which China dominates. While Foxconn brought in Taiwanese workers, the lack of equipment is a bigger challenge. This move threatens India’s goal of becoming a global manufacturing hub.
Today’s editorial discusses challenges arising from China’s dominance in the global supply chain. This topic is relevant for GS Paper 2 and GS Paper 3 in the UPSC Mains.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Recently, China has stopped its engineers and technicians from travelling to work at Foxconn’s facilities in India.
How is China using e-supply chains as a strategic tool?
Monopoly Over Critical Manufacturing Equipment:

: Chinese engineers working at Foxconn’s Indian facilities were recalled, creating a skills gap that affected Apple’s production capacity.
Disrupting Supply Chains to Gain Geopolitical Leverage:
China can manipulate logistics, trade policies, and export restrictions to pressure countries and corporations dependent on its supply chains.
: During the U.S.-China trade war, China imposed export controls on key components for companies like Huawei and Apple, demonstrating its leverage in global electronics production.
Deep Integration into Global Manufacturing Networks:
Through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and heavy investments in industrial zones, China ensures that multinational corporations remain reliant on its supply chains.
: Despite U.S. sanctions, companies like Tesla and Apple continue significant operations in China due to its well-integrated and cost-effective supply chain ecosystem.
What are the risks and vulnerabilities posed by China’s control over e-supply chains?
Disruptions to Critical Industries:
China’s dominance in semiconductor manufacturing, rare earth metals, and electronics components makes other nations vulnerable to supply chain shocks.
India depends on China for over 75% of electronic components, affecting smartphone and telecom industries. The 2020 global chip shortage, worsened by China’s export controls, severely impacted industries like automobiles, defence, and consumer electronics.
Geopolitical and Economic Coercion:
China can weaponize supply chains to exert diplomatic pressure or punish countries for political disagreements.
Post-Galwan clash (2020), India faced delays in customs clearance for Chinese goods, disrupting industries reliant on imports.
Lithuania faced trade restrictions in 2021 after allowing a Taiwan representative office, showing how China uses supply chains as leverage.
Vulnerability in Strategic Sectors (Telecom, Defense, Energy):
Dependence on Chinese technology in strategic sectors poses risks related to cybersecurity, espionage, and sabotage.
India banned Huawei and ZTE from 5G trials due to concerns over data security. The U.S. and EU have imposed restrictions on Chinese telecom firms citing national security threats.
Supply Chain Manipulation and Price Volatility:
China’s control over rare earth metals, batteries, and semiconductors allows it to manipulate prices and supply.
Despite efforts to develop local lithium-ion battery production, India still relies on China for key materials, affecting the EV sector. In 2023, China restricted gallium and germanium exports, leading to price spikes for these critical semiconductor materials.
Stifling Competitor Growth and Technological Dependence:
China restricts the transfer of critical machinery and skilled labor to competitors to maintain its manufacturing edge.
China’s ban on engineers working in Indian Foxconn plants and export curbs on key equipment have slowed India’s smartphone manufacturing expansion. U.S. firms like Apple, Tesla, and Intel remain dependent on China’s supply chains, despite attempts at diversification.
How can countries and companies safeguard themselves from China’s influence over e-supply chains? (Way Forward)
Supply Chain Diversification (China Plus One Strategy):
Countries and companies should expand production to alternative locations to reduce reliance on China.

Significant Progress in Functionaries:
The percentage of functionaries assigned to Panchayats increased from
39.6% to 50.9%
, indicating efforts in recruitment and personnel strengthening.
What are the Major concerns in effective Devolution?
Election Management:
State Election Commissions (SECs) sometimes consult with state governments on election dates, leading to potential delays or political manipulation.
Example:
In Maharashtra, Panchayat elections were delayed in 2022 due to the state government’s interference
Non-centrality of Panchayats:
Panchayats operate in subjects designated for them in the eleventh schedule but face challenges that undermine their constitutional mandate.
In many states, rural development schemes like PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana) are implemented by state departments rather than Gram Panchayats.
Inadequate devolution of functions, funds, and functionaries:
The devolution of functions, funds, and functionaries to PRIs has been inadequate, limiting their ability to effectively discharge their responsibilities.
In Jharkhand and Odisha, despite having legal provisions for devolution, Panchayats have limited control over education, health, and agriculture schemes.
Lack of financial autonomy:
PRIs don’t have enough financial independence since they mostly depend on irregular and inadequate grants from state governments.
In Uttar Pradesh, Gram Panchayats rely heavily on state grants for executing local projects.
