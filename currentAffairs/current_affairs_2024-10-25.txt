CENTRAL GOVT. SANCTION A 50% HIKE IN PRICES OF EIGHT DRUGS
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
: National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority of India (NPPA) increased the ceiling prices of eight drugs, comprising medication for common diseases including asthma, tuberculosis, bipolar disorder, and glaucoma, among others.
The Central Government passed the order, citing “extraordinary circumstances” and “public interest.”
The NPPA, constituted in 1997, regulates ceiling prices of drugs and has the power to fix costs under what is known as a ‘Drug Price Control Order’ (DPCO) issued by the government under the Essential Commodities Act.
NPPA comes under the department of pharmaceuticals under the Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers.
The NPPA approved an increase in ceiling prices of eleven scheduled formulations of eight drugs by 50% of their current ceiling prices, in the larger public interest. NPPA invoked extraordinary powers under Para 19 of the DPCO, 2013.
Section 19 of the DPCO allows the government to revise the ceiling cost in extraordinary circumstances.
Section 19 states: “Notwithstanding anything contained in this order, the Government may, in case of extraordinary circumstances, if it considers it necessary to do so in public interest, fix the ceiling price or retail price of any drug for such period, as it may deem fit and where the ceiling price or retail price of the drug is already fixed and notified, the government may allow an increase or decrease in the ceiling price or the retail price, as the case may be, irrespective of annual wholesale price index for that year.”
Every financial year starting April 1, the NPPA increases ceiling prices of drugs based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI) of the preceding year.
Pricing of drugs in India is strictly controlled by the Central government. Action is taken against companies found selling at higher prices.

STATE CONTINGENT DEBT INSTRUMENTS
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
The recent cascade of countries defaulting on their debt has brought back into vogue complex securities called State Contingent Debt Instruments.
State Contingent Debt Instruments has helped nations from Ukraine to Sri Lanka resolve difficult debt negotiations.
State Contingent Debt Instruments (SCDIs) are financial instruments whose repayment terms are linked to certain economic variables or outcomes, like GDP growth, commodity prices, or revenue collection.
SCDIs differ from the bulk of sovereign bonds which pay a predetermined amount in interest before a final repayment.
Purpose:
To provide fiscal flexibility to states by reducing debt servicing pressure during economic downturns.
Helps manage debt burden effectively by aligning repayment with state revenue performance.
Mechanism:
Unlike traditional fixed debt instruments, SCDIs allow variation in repayment based on the agreed-upon economic indicators.
When a state faces a downturn, repayments may be reduced; conversely, in a strong economic period, repayments could increase.
Benefits:
Counter-Cyclical Support: Helps states manage debt better during economic stress by lowering repayment obligations.
Debt Sustainability: Reduces the likelihood of debt distress, aiding long-term fiscal health.
Fiscal Stability: Supports better planning and stability by managing repayment according to economic performance.
Recent Example
Ukraine used SCDIs as part of a package to convince investors in August to swap their defaulted bonds for newer instruments — including a GDP-linked bond, which would pay investors more if the economy grows faster than anticipated.

GEO ENGINEERING: SPRAYING DIAMOND DUST TO COOL EARTH
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
A new study has argued that spraying millions of tonnes of diamond dust in the Earth’s upper atmosphere every year could help cool down the Earth and combat global warming.
Previously, several other compounds, such as sulphur, calcium, aluminium, and silicon, have been suggested. The idea here is to scatter material that can reflect solar radiation into Space and prevent it from reaching Earth. Such solutions, called geo-engineering (more specifically solar radiation management), have been under study for quite some time.
Geo engineering refers to any large-scale attempt to alter the Earth’s natural climate system to counter the adverse impacts of global warming.
Solar Radiation Management (SRM), in which materials are deployed in Space to reflect incoming solar rays and prevent them from reaching Earth, is one of the two broad geoengineering options being explored.
Then there are Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies, which include Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS).
The only method being tried out in practice is CCS. Carbon dioxide emitted, from industry or power plants, is “captured” at source and deposited deep below the Earth’s surface in suitable geological formations for long-term storage. Since carbon dioxide is not released into the atmosphere, overall emissions are reduced.
Another option involves the captured carbon being used as an input for other industrial processes (known as Carbon Capture and Utilisation or CCU). In Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), some carbon dioxide is utilised and the rest is stored underground.
Under Direct Air Capture (DAC) methods, carbon dioxide is sucked out through large “artificial trees” from ambient air and directed towards storage sites or utilisation. Since these methods can potentially eliminate carbon dioxide accumulated over the years, the benefits are larger compared to CCS.
The most ambitious and potentially rewarding form of geoengineering is SRM, which is still at the conceptual stage. It draws inspiration from the natural process of volcanic eruptions, in which large amounts of sulphur dioxide are released. These combine with water vapour to form sulphate particles that reflect sunlight into space, reducing the amount reaching Earth.
The Mount Pinatubo eruptions in the Philippines in 1991, one of the largest in the 20th century, are believed to have reduced the Earth’s temperature by 0.5 degrees Celsius that year.

KEY BIODIVERSITY AREAS (KBA)
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
At the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), new data was released which shows that the world’s best and most important ecosystems are facing threat from extractive industries. These include key biodiversity areas (KBAs), high-integrity forest landscapes, protected areas, and Indigenous territories.
Maps included in a report titled “Closing Window of Opportunity: Mapping Threats from Oil, Gas and Mining to Important Areas for Conservation in the Pantropics” show that extraction is being carried out for oil, gas, and mining in important areas for conservation across the Amazon Basin, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia.
About Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA)
Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) are geographical regions that have been determined to be of international importance in terms of biodiversity conservation, using globally standardized criteria published by the IUCN as part of a collaboration between scientists, conservation groups, and government bodies across the world.
The purpose of Key Biodiversity Areas is to identify regions that are in need of protection by governments or other agencies.
KBAs extend the Important Bird Area (IBA) concept to other taxonomic groups and are now being identified in many parts of the world. Examples of types of KBAs include Important Plant Areas (IPAs), Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) in the High Seas, Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites, Prime Butterfly Areas, Important Mammal Areas and Important Sites for Freshwater Biodiversity, with prototype criteria developed for freshwater molluscs and fish and for marine systems.
The Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sets out globally agreed criteria for the identification of KBAs worldwide.
Sites qualify as global KBAs if they meet one or more of 11 criteria, clustered into five higher level categories: threatened biodiversity, geographically restricted biodiversity, ecological integrity, biological processes, and irreplaceability.
The KBA criteria can be applied to species and ecosystems in terrestrial, inland water, and marine environments, and may be applied across all taxonomic groups (other than micro-organisms).

ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS A THREAT TO INTERNAL SECURITY
Mains – GS 3
Three Bangladeshi nationals have been apprehended in two days while trying to enter Indian territory by negotiating the border fence, the Border Security Force (BSF) said.
The BSF has stepped up vigilance along the border in Tripura.
Illegal Immigration is a Threat to Internal Security:
It is alleged that among the illegal migrants there are also militants especially groups such as NSCN/KUFLA, who enter India to carry out terrorist activities.
In recent decades, trafficking of women and human smuggling has become quite rampant across borders.
The Commission on Integration and Cohesion found that tension usually exists with the presence of high levels of migration combined with other forms of social exclusion like poverty, poor housing, etc.
Immigration has increased pressure on the part of the government, as the government has to increase the expenditure on education and health facilities for the immigrants.
Most illegal immigrants have their names enlisted in the voting list illegally, thereby claiming themselves as citizens of the state.
The influx of immigrants created a crisis of identity among the indigenous people of the region.
Large areas of forestland were encroached upon by the immigrants for settlement and cultivation. This creates conflict in resource utilization with the local communities.
Laws in India to tackle Illegal Migration:
Under the Foreigners Act of 1946, the central government can deport illegal foreign nationals.
Under the Passport (Entry into India) Act of 1920, the state governments have been entrusted to remove an illegal foreigner by force.
The Citizenship Act of 1955 provides for the acquisition and determination of Indian citizenship.
Way Forward:
A considerable portion of the problem of illegal immigration lies in the fact that we have no such effective refugee policy. The central government should frame a holistic refugee policy.
India has to make a diplomatic effort to get neighboring countries to cooperate as illegal migration cannot be solved unless the origin country cooperates.
The government should introduce identity cards for the borderland people who frequently used to cross borders for different reasons.
There is a vast area of the border that is not protected by fencing. The central government should complete the border fencing.
Regional forums like BIMSTEC can be used to discuss issues like illegal migration from neighboring countries and garner support and coordination from the members.
Border guards like BSF and ITBP should be strengthened and a second line of defence can be created by the State government through the state police force.

About
Cyclones that develop in the regions between the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer are called tropical cyclones.
The World Meteorological Organisation uses the term 'Tropical Cyclone’ to cover weather systems in which winds exceed ‘Gale Force’ (minimum of 34 knots or 63 kph).
Tropical cyclones are the progeny of ocean and atmosphere, powered by the heat from the sea; and driven by easterly trades and temperate westerlies, high planetary winds and their own fierce energy.
Formation of cyclones
Tropical Cyclone is a
weather phenomenon
, which is formed
only over warm ocean waters near the equator
Characteristics of a Tropical Cyclone:
centre of a cyclone is very calm and clear with very low air pressure
. The average speed is

isobars
which leads to greater velocity.
Isobars are imaginary lines on a weather map that connect
locations with equal atmospheric pressure
They develop over oceans and sea only.
move from east to west
under the influence of trade winds.
They are seasonal in nature.
Classification of cyclones
Cyclones are classified
on the basis of wind speed
by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD):
Depression:
Wind speeds of between 31–49 km/h
Deep Depression:
Between 50-61 km/h
Cyclonic Storm:
Between 62–88 km/h
Severe Cyclonic Storm:
Between 89-117 Km/h
Very Severe Cyclonic Storm:
Between 118-166 Km/h
Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm
: Between 167-221 Km/h
Super Cyclonic Storm
: Above 222 Km/h
Category of a tropical cyclone
The category of a tropical cyclone is determined by its sustained wind speed, as measured by the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale
It is classified into five categories — Category 1 to Category 5.
While Category 1 tropical cyclones bring winds of 119 to 153 kmph, Category 5 tropical cyclones, which are the strongest, have winds of 252 kmph or higher.
Storms that reach Category 3 and higher are considered major tropical cyclones due to their potential to inflict significant damage.
Tropical cyclones are known by different names in various regions
Hurricanes
– In the in the West Indian islands in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.
Tornados
- In the Guinea lands of West Africa and southern USA
Typhoons
– In the Northwest Pacific Ocean, particularly affecting East and Southeast Asia (e.g., Japan, Philippines, China, Taiwan).
– In the Southwest Indian Ocean (off the coast of Africa, Madagascar), the Southeast Indian Ocean, and the Southwest Pacific Ocean.
Willy-Willies
– An informal term used for tropical cyclones in Australia.
Naming of Cyclones
Cyclone Dana
The name
Dana was suggested by Qatar
to the World Meteorological Organisation/United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (WMO/ESCAP).
Process of naming
Worldwide, there are
six regional specialised meteorological centres
(RSMCs) and
five regional Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres
(TCWCs) mandated for issuing advisories and naming of tropical cyclones.
The five regional Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs) are:
ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee,
WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones
It is responsible for naming of cyclones in the Indian Ocean
RA(Regional Association) I Tropical Cyclone Committee,
RA IV Hurricane Committee,
RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee.
IMD is one of the six RSMCs to provide tropical cyclone and storm surge advisories to under the
WMO/Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP).
WMO/ ESCAP is an inter-governmental regional body jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP) in 1972.
Members
– It has 13 countries as its members.
Bangladesh, India, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.
They contribute to a set of names which are assigned sequentially whenever a cyclonic storm develops.
The list of 169 cyclone names released by IMD in 2020 was provided by these countries — 13 suggestions from each of the 13 countries.
So, the tropical cyclones forming over different Ocean basins are named by the concerned RSMCs & TCWCs.
What is landfall of a cyclone?
Landfall is the event of a tropical cyclone coming onto land after being over water.
As per the IMD, a tropical cyclone is said to have made a landfall when
the center of the storm – or its
eye
– moves over the coast
The "eye" of a cyclone is a region of relatively calm weather found at the center of the storm.
Within the eye, winds are light and variable, often with clear or only partially cloudy skies.
The size of the eye can vary significantly, ranging from a few kilometers to over 50 kilometers (30 miles) in diameter in larger cyclones.
During landfall, the outer bands of the storm may have already reached the coast, bringing strong winds, heavy rain, and storm surge.
Landfall marks the moment when the cyclone officially reaches the land.
A landfall should not be confused with a ‘direct hit’, which refers to a situation where the
core of high winds (or eyewall) comes onshore but the centre of the storm may stay remain offshore

**********India-China LAC Agreement
Why in news?
Indian and Chinese negotiators have reached an agreement on "patrolling arrangements" along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), leading to a disengagement and resolution of the tensions that emerged in 2020. The announcement was made by India, highlighting progress in the management of the border dispute.
The agreement was followed by a bilateral meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the BRICS leaders' summit in Kazan, Russia.
What’s in today’s article?
Background: Road to agreement
Patrolling Pact: A Key Element of the Agreement
Key highlights of the agreement
Diverging Interpretations
PM Modi's Call for Improved Relations with China
In April 2024, PM Modi, in an interview, emphasized the significance of India's relationship with China.
He highlighted the need to urgently address the prolonged border situation to normalize bilateral interactions.
Positive Response from China
In response, the Chinese government expressed a positive outlook.
A spokesperson from the Chinese Foreign Ministry acknowledged that India-China relations encompass more than just the border dispute.
Indian Foreign Minister's Focus on Patrolling Rights (May 2024)
In May 2024, Indian EAM S. Jaishankar expressed optimism regarding the resolution of remaining border disputes with China, particularly in the Ladakh region.
He emphasized that the key issues still in contention were related to "patrolling rights" and "patrolling abilities" along the disputed areas.
Significance
The patrolling agreement is a crucial aspect of the border management deal between India and China.
It is central to maintaining stability and order along the disputed areas of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
Patrolling Dynamics on the India-China Border
Patrolling is vital in the India-China border management system
due to the absence of a clear physical demarcation on the ground
Indian troops regularly patrol up to the Indian-perceived border and then return to their base.
During these patrols, soldiers leave behind indicators of their presence, such as Indian-made items like cigarette packets or matchboxes.
Article 4 of the 2005 Border Pact: Guidelines for Troop Conduct
The 2005 border agreement, particularly Article 4, provides guidelines for handling face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops:
Self-Restraint in Face-offs
: Both sides are required to exercise restraint and take necessary measures to prevent escalation if there is a face-to-face encounter due to differing perceptions of the LAC.
No Use of Force
: Neither side shall use or threaten to use force during such encounters.
Mutual Courtesy and No Provocative Actions
: Troops must treat each other courteously and avoid any actions that could provoke tensions.
Prohibition on Markings
: Neither side is allowed to place marks or signs at the confrontation points.
Restoration of Patrolling Rights in Depsang Plains and Demchok
India and China have agreed to restore mutual patrolling rights in the Depsang Plains and the Demchok region, areas with disputes predating the 2020 incursions.
Indian troops will now be allowed to patrol up to Patrolling Points (PP) 10 to 13 in the Depsang Plains and the Charding Nullah in Demchok.
However, areas where previous disengagements occurred—such as Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso, and Gogra-Hot Springs—are not open for renegotiation.
This agreement is seen as a step toward resolving long-standing legacy issues.
Process of Disengagement, De-escalation, and Demilitarization
The agreement is expected to initiate a process of
disengagement, de-escalation, and demilitarization
in the areas where both nations currently have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each.
The phased approach of the agreement will focus first on disengagement, followed by de-escalation and eventual de-induction of forces.
Focus on Preventing Future Clashes
The agreement aims to prevent incidents like the 2020 Galwan clashes, which resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese soldiers.
Future Path
The endorsement of the agreement by Indian PM Modi and Chinese President Xi should lead to a reduction in tensions along the LAC and set the stage for normalizing relations between the two countries.
Difference
Following the meeting between PM Modi and President Xi Jinping, differences in interpretation emerged.
India's statement emphasized a "complete disengagement and resolution of issues that arose in 2020.
On the other hand, China's statement highlighted "important progress" on resolving relevant border issues, reflecting a more cautious tone.
Contrasting Views on the Impact of the Border Dispute
India has reiterated that the border standoff must be resolved before normalizing bilateral ties, indicating no "business as usual" until then.
In contrast, China maintains that the border issue should not affect broader relations, suggesting it prefers a compartmentalized approach.
Planned Steps for Resolving the Border Dispute
Indian side mentioned that Special Representatives would soon meet to seek a fair, reasonable, and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question.
Meanwhile, China's statement suggested future talks at multiple diplomatic levels to restore relations to sound and steady development.
Conclusion: Cautious Optimism in India’s Strategic Circles
There is cautious optimism in India about the path forward, acknowledging that the border agreement has initiated a trust-building process.
The three-step process—disengagement, de-escalation, and de-induction—is expected to take at least a couple of years to complete if both sides adhere to the agreement.
It remains unclear whether these steps will occur in parallel or sequentially.

Awareness Programs:
Need to run awareness campaigns to inform the community about the value of modernizing madrasa education.
How do political narratives and policies affect the perception of madrasas among the Muslim community?
Communal Narratives and Stereotyping:
Political narratives often portray madrasas as breeding grounds for extremism, which affects the public’s perception, especially among non-Muslims.
Legislative and Policy Decisions:
Policies such as withdrawing government funding or enforcing stringent regulations can create a perception of bias against Muslim educational institutions.
Historical Reason and Islamophobia:
Historical events like the U.S.-Taliban conflict have influenced perceptions of madrasas, linking them to extremism. Political rhetoric often builds on these associations to foster Islamophobic sentiments.
Social Justice versus Appeasement:
There is a debate on whether supporting madrasas financially is an act of social justice (ensuring access to education) or appeasement.
What role can madrasas play in promoting social cohesion and countering extremism?
Interfaith Learning and Dialogue:
Madrasas can include teachings that promote understanding and respect for other religions.
Combating Radicalization:
By modernizing curricula to include secular education and critical thinking, madrasas can counter extremist narratives. An informed and educated student body is more resilient to radical ideologies.
Community Engagement Programs:
Madrasas can play a role in community service and outreach, helping bridge the gap between Muslim communities and others. This engagement can dispel misconceptions and build mutual trust.
Promoting National Values and Secular Ideals:
Incorporating national education standards in madrasas can help in promoting the values enshrined in the Indian Constitution, such as secularism, social justice, and equality.
Way forward:
Comprehensive Policy Reforms:
Develop a national framework that integrates modern subjects into madrasa education, provides teacher training, and ensures quality monitoring.

**********US court to decide whether elephants get human rights
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Rights of nonhuman;
Why in the News?
Colorado’s highest court recently reviewed whether older African female elephants can legally contest their captivity, as the NonHuman Rights Project claims they are unlawfully confined.
What is nonhuman?
Nonhuman animals are living beings other than humans, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and insects, recognized for their
capacity to feel, behave, and interact.
What is Legal personhood?
Legal personhood is the status granted to an entity, allowing it to
hold legal rights
obligations,
traditionally applied to humans and some organizations.
Example:
All human individuals are recognized as legal persons. This allows them to enter into contracts, sue, and be sued in court.
What Constitutes Legal Personhood for Nonhuman Animals?
Legal Personhood Definition:
Legal personhood refers to the capacity of an entity to have legal rights and duties. In law, a “person” is not strictly limited to human beings; corporations, for example, are considered legal persons.
Application to Nonhuman Animals:
Extending legal personhood to nonhuman animals involves granting them certain legal rights, such as the right to not be unlawfully confined or exploited. This would require redefining animals’ status from property to beings with inherent rights.
Arguments in Favor:
Proponents argue that certain highly intelligent and socially complex animals, such as elephants, dolphins, and great apes, should be granted legal rights because they can experience
suffering and possess a degree of autonomy akin
to that of
humans.
Arguments Against:
Opponents of legal personhood for animals argue that the legal system is designed for human society and extending personhood to animals could lead to complex legal issues.
They contend that animal welfare can be ensured through legislative protections rather than redefining personhood.
How can societies balance animal welfare with cultural practices that might clash with today’s views on animal rights?
Engagement and Dialogue:
Encourage conversations between cultural leaders, communities, and animal rights advocates to understand different perspectives and find common ground on how to improve animal welfare while respecting traditions.
Education and Awareness:
Promote education about animal welfare and the capacity of animals to feel pain and suffering, helping communities to reconsider practices and adopt alternatives that align with both cultural values and humane treatment.
Legal Frameworks:
Implement laws that protect animal welfare while allowing for cultural practices to continue in a regulated manner, ensuring that such practices do not involve cruelty or inhumane treatment of animals.
What are the Rights of Animals in the Indian Context?
Traditional and Cultural Practices:
In India, animals play a significant role in various cultural and religious practices. For instance, cows are considered sacred in Hinduism, while elephants are used in festivals and ceremonies.
Legal Framework for Animal Rights:
India has several laws aimed at protecting animal rights, such as the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. These laws establish standards for animal welfare and criminalize cruelty.
However, they stop short of granting legal personhood to animals.
Judicial Intervention:
The Indian judiciary has taken progressive stances on animal rights in some cases.
For example, the Uttarakhand High Court in 2018 declared all animals in the state to be legal entities, with citizens acting as guardians. This ruling emphasized the need to protect animals’ dignity and well-being, though it did not grant full legal personhood.
Conclusion:
India can look toward a framework that balances animal welfare with cultural practices by adopting context-specific policies. This could include creating more robust welfare standards, engaging with communities to find humane alternatives, and fostering a cultural shift toward greater empathy for animals.

Recent research has revealed a surprising finding about
(which was believed to explode): the star’s unusual
brightening and dimming patterns
may be influenced by an
unseen companion star
.
About Betelgeuse
Betelgeuse is a
red supergiant star
Orion constellation
, marking Orion’s left shoulder.
It is among the
brightest and largest stars
visible in the night sky, located about
650 light-years
from Earth.
The star is nearing the end of its life, and when it dies, its explosion is expected to be
visible during the day for several weeks
Betelgeuse is vast, measuring more than
700 million miles (1.2 billion kilometers)
in diameter.
Known for its
periodic dimming and brightening
, Betelgeuse has two distinct pulsation cycles:
short-term cycle
of about one year.
longer six-year cycle
called a
long secondary period
Researchers believe this longer cycle may be caused by
Betelbuddy
(an unseen companion star) moving through the
dust surrounding Betelgeuse
Indicators and Scientific Evidence
Betelgeuse’s
cyclic dimming and brightening
patterns indicate it is nearing the end of its life.
Its
massive size and expansion
as a red supergiant suggest it is in a late stellar stage.
Cooling surface temperature
mass loss
through stellar winds signal increasing instability.
Spectral analysis
shows heavy elements in Betelgeuse’s layers, typical of late-stage fusion.
An unseen
companion star, or “Betelbuddy,”
may be influencing its brightness and internal structure.
Potential Effects of Betelgeuse’s Supernova on Earth and Our Solar System
Betelgeuse’s supernova will likely be
visible in daylight
for weeks and brighter than the Moon at night.
At 650 light-years away,
dangerous radiation
would dissipate before reaching Earth, posing no harm.
Space missions and satellites
may experience minor interference from increased cosmic rays.
The explosion will enrich the
interstellar medium
with heavy elements, contributing to new star formation.
The supernova will provide
valuable scientific insights
into stellar life cycles and cosmic element formation.

Several
states annexed due to this Doctrine
, include Satara (1848), Jaitpur (1849), Sambalpur (1849), Udaipur (1850), Jhansi (1853), and Nagpur (1854).
Prior to the Doctrine of Lapse, princely states had a traditional practice of selecting an heir from a
group of candidates known as
bhajans
