Who Selects the University Vice-Chancellor?
Context
The
selection of Vice Chancellors (VCs) in Indian universities has long been a topic of contention
, marked by overregulation, political influence, and lack of innovation.
Despite significant strides in global academia,
India struggles to secure a place for its universities in the world’s top rankings.
The recent draft regulations
by the University Grants Commission (UGC), alongside the New Education Policy (NEP),
present opportunities for change but fall short of granting true autonomy to universities.
An Analysis of Current Regulations and Challenges
Overregulation and Limited Vision in VC Appointments
Madras High Court’s observation
in Kalyani Mathivanan (2015) that
even Albert Einstein might not meet the qualifications for a VC role in India
highlights the rigidity of the current system.
As per UGC regulations introduced in 2010 and revised in 2018, a VC must be a distinguished academician
with at least ten years of experience as a professor or equivalent.
While these standards aim to ensure merit,
they also exclude competent leaders from non-academic backgrounds,
stifling the potential for innovation in university governance.
By contrast, Western universities, such as Oxford, have appointed individuals like John Hood, a businessman, as their head
, demonstrating the value of versatile leadership over purely academic credentials.
Political Expediency in Selection Processes
The appointment of VCs in India is often swayed by political preferences
rather than merit.
Historically,
Congress-led governments have favoured left-leaning candidates
, while current administrations opt for ideologically aligned individuals.
This
politicisation undermines the role of a VC
as a bridge between academic and administrative wings.
The government’s pervasive control over VC appointments
in central and state universities further
erodes institutional autonomy.
This was
exemplified by the Supreme Court judgment in Dr. Premachandran Keezhoth (2023), which clarified that the President acts as a statutory authority
rather than a constitutional head in such decisions.
The Recent Draft Regulations by the UGC, and Challenges in Search and Selection Process
The Recent Draft: Expanding the Pool of Eligible Candidates
new draft UGC regulations propose a welcome expansion of eligibility criteria
to include distinguished individuals from fields like industry, public administration, and public policy.
This aligns with past successes
where non-academic leaders excelled in the VC role.
For instance,
diplomats like G. Parthasarathy and K.R. Narayanan, as well as bureaucrats such as Syed Hamid and Mehmoodur Rehman, led universities like Jawaharlal Nehru University
and Aligarh Muslim University with distinction.
Their contributions underscore the value of opening the VC position
to accomplished individuals from diverse backgrounds.
Transparency vs. Quality
Advertising senior leadership positions
publicly democratises the application process but compromises efficiency.
While it ensures that no eligible candidate is excluded
due to lack of access to informal networks, it also opens the floodgates to unqualified or marginally qualified applicants.
Search committees, often composed of academic and administrative leaders, must sift through a large volume of applications
, which may divert attention from deeper evaluations of the most promising candidates.
This step risks undermining the quality of final selections.
Underrated Virtues: The Case for Humility
An often-overlooked quality in leadership assessments is humility.
Effective Vice Chancellors must engage with diverse stakeholders,
including students, faculty, administrative staff, and policymakers, requiring a balanced and approachable demeanour.
Arrogance, on the other hand, alienates collaborators and creates an adversarial environment that can stifle innovation and growth.
While academic brilliance and administrative competence are prerequisites, humility enhances a VC’s ability to build consensus
, resolve conflicts, and foster an inclusive culture.
However,
the current frameworks for evaluation rarely prioritise such interpersonal virtues,
focusing instead on measurable credentials and achievements.
Consistency Across Institutions
Another challenge lies in the
lack of standardisation across universities
While central universities have well-defined protocols,
state universities often lack clear guidelines, resulting in inconsistencies in how VCs are selected.
disparity exacerbates regional inequities
in the quality of higher education leadership.
Establishing baseline criteria
for both search processes and candidate evaluations across all types of universities
can mitigate these disparities while allowing for contextual adaptations.
Way Forward
Balancing Transparency with Efficiency
The dual goals of transparency and efficiency can be harmonised by
implementing hybrid systems.
alongside public advertisements, universities could mandate that all applications be accompanied by endorsements from reputable individuals
step could filter out frivolous applicants
while retaining the spirit of openness.
Additionally, search committees could adopt structured scoring systems
to assess both tangible qualifications and intangible traits such as vision, leadership style, and adaptability.
Autonomy in University Governance: Lessons from Global Practices
Globally, universities operate with greater autonomy
in choosing their leaders.
In the West and parts of Africa, governments play a minimal role in VC appointments,
allowing institutions to tailor leadership choices to their unique needs.
In contrast,
a 1996 Commonwealth study revealed that 55% of Asian universities rely on government-appointed VCs
, with only 27% enjoying full autonomy.
India’s centralised, top-down model stifles innovation and adaptability,
leaving universities ill-equipped to address their distinct challenges.
Need for a Decentralised Approach
For India’s higher education system to thrive,
it must adopt a decentralised approach to VC selection.
The draft UGC regulations propose a three-member search committee
, with two members nominated by government-affiliated bodies and only one by the university. This
structure perpetuates governmental dominance.
more balanced model would allow universities to nominate three members, alongside representatives from the UGC
and a constitutional authority such as the President or Chief Justice.
By empowering universities
, the focus can shift from VC-centric governance to student-centric development.
Towards Student-Centric Universities
ultimate goal of university leadership should be to create a student-centric culture rather than a VC-centric system.
By empowering institutions to select leaders who align with their distinctive needs and values,
Indian universities can move towards a more dynamic, innovative, and globally competitive education system.
Trusting universities to make these decisions is a vital step in achieving this transformation.
Reducing Political Interference
The politicisation of VC appointments is a significant barrier
to merit-based selection and institutional autonomy.
An independent oversight body, free from government influence, could oversee the selection process.
Such a body might include representatives from the judiciary, academia, and civil society, ensuring impartiality.
The government’s role should be limited to approving shortlists created by search committees,
rather than directly nominating or appointing candidates. This would help curb political bias while retaining some oversight.
Conclusion
Indian universities face a critical juncture in their pursuit of academic excellence and global recognition
and reforming the selection process for Vice Chancellors is essential to achieving this goal.
By embracing autonomy,
expanding the pool of eligible candidates, and fostering a culture of meritocracy,
India can cultivate versatile leaders capable of steering universities toward innovation and inclusivity.
Trusting universities to make their own leadership choices is not merely a necessity but a prerequisite
for restoring their role as beacons of knowledge and progress.

**********Rat-hole mining: Several workers stuck in a coal mine in Assam
Why in news?
Three miners were confirmed dead, and six remained trapped in a flooded coal "rat-hole" mine in Assam’s Dima Hasao district.
The water level inside the pit is 200 feet deep, and an Indian Navy team with deep-sea divers arrived to assist in rescue operations. The incident occurred in a coal mine in Umrangso, where nine workers aged 26 to 57 were trapped.
Although Dima Hasao has extensive coal and quarrying activities, Assam Chief Minister stated that the mine appears to be illegal.
What’s in today’s article?
What is Rat-hole mining?
Ban on Rat-Hole Mining by NGT
About
It is a method of extracting coal from narrow, horizontal seams, widely prevalent in Meghalaya.
The term “rat hole”
refers to the narrow pits dug into the ground, typically just large enough for one person to descend and extract coal
Once the pits are dug, miners descend using ropes or bamboo ladders to reach the coal seams.
The coal is then manually extracted using primitive tools such as pickaxes, shovels, and baskets.
Types
Rat-hole mining is broadly of two types.
In the
side-cutting procedure
, narrow tunnels are dug on the hill slopes and workers go inside until they find the coal seam.
The coal seam in hills of Meghalaya is very thin, less than 2 m in most cases
The other type of rat-hole mining is called
box-cutting
In this type, a rectangular opening is made, varying from 10 to 100 sqm, and through that a vertical pit is dug, 100 to 400 feet deep.
Once the coal seam is found, rat-hole-sized tunnels are dug horizontally through which workers can extract the coal.
Hazards of Rat-Hole Mining
Safety Concerns
Lack of proper ventilation, structural support, and safety gear.
Frequent accidents resulting in injuries and fatalities.
Environmental Impact
Causes land degradation and deforestation.
Contributes to water pollution.
Challenges
Socioeconomic Challenges
Practices persist due to economic factors.
Lack of alternative livelihoods for local communities hinders regulation.
Regulatory Issues
Mines are often unregulated despite efforts to ban or control them.
The practice continues to face severe criticism for its risks and environmental damage.
NGT Ban and Observations
The National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned rat-hole mining in 2014 and upheld the ban in 2015.
Highlighted numerous fatalities caused by flooding in mining areas during the rainy season.
Focus on Meghalaya
The ban was specifically enforced in Meghalaya, where rat-hole mining was widely practiced for coal extraction.
Meghalaya's state government appealed the NGT’s order in the Supreme Court.

**********Nitrogen Use Efficiency
Researchers have demonstrated that reducing nitric oxide (NO) levels in plants can significantly improve nitrogen uptake and Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) in rice and Arabidopsis.
About Nitrogen Use Efficiency:
It is a term that is used to describe the
efficiency of a plant
in using applied or fixed nitrogen for biomass production.
It is further defined as the
ratio between crop yield and the amount of nitrogen absorbed
from the soil through roots or from the atmosphere through fixation by bacteria.
NUE is an important trait in crop breeding programs, which aims to improve crop yield while reducing input costs, such as fertilizers, and at the same time keeping nitrogen out of the environment.
Issues with Traditional methods:
They can lead to
increased operational costs
for farmers and contribute to environmental issues, such as the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) during fertilizer production, contributing to global warming.
Highlights of the study:
The recent study highlights a novel approach to improving NUE by focusing on the
systemic regulation of Nitrogen Oxide (NO) levels in plants.
By modulating these levels, researchers can influence the activity of
high-affinity nitrate transporters (HATs),
which play a vital role in nitrogen uptake.
This method diverges from traditional practices, offering a more sustainable solution to enhance crop yields while reducing nitrogen inputs. As the world faces challenges related to food security, this research provides a promising pathway for developing more efficient agricultural practices.
Significance of Nitric oxide (NO):
It plays a pivotal role in regulating
various physiological processes in plants
It is involved in the activation of
high-affinity nitrate transporters,
which are crucial for nitrogen uptake, especially under
low nitrogen conditions.

**********China’s 7.1 Magnitude Earthquake: Significance and Implications
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Location of the Earthquake (Geographical & Cultural Context, Critical Infrastructure, Environment, etc.)
Causes of Earthquake (Tectonic Dynamics, Historical Seismic Activities, etc.)
Conclusion
Background:
On
January 7, 2025
, a powerful earthquake of magnitude
struck the Tibetan region of China and parts of Nepal.
The epicentre was located approximately
10 km below the surface
Tingry County, Shigatse region
, around
80 km north of Mount Everest
By evening, reports confirmed at least
95 fatalities
130 injuries
, and the destruction of hundreds of houses. Tremors were felt as far as
Kathmandu (Nepal)
Thimphu (Bhutan)
Kolkata (India)
Why Does the Location of the Earthquake Matter?
Geographical and Cultural Context:
Epicentre Location
: Tingry County lies in the Shigatse region of Tibet, a high-altitude area averaging
4-5 km above sea level
and home to about
800,000 residents
Cultural Significance
: Shigatse is an important spiritual hub, housing the
Panchen Lama
of Tibetan Buddhism.
Tourism Impact
: Tingry serves as a gateway to Mount Everest. Although tourist numbers are lower in winter, the earthquake led to the suspension of tourist activities in the region.
Proximity to Critical Infrastructure:
Lhasa Terrane
: The earthquake occurred in the
Lhasa terrane
, a tectonic fragment crucial for geophysical studies and development projects.
Mega Dam Project
: The region hosts China’s ambitious

**********India's GDP Growth Slows to 6.4% in FY25
Why in News?
India's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is projected to grow at 6.4% in the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), marking a four-year low.
This slowdown is attributed to weak industrial and investment growth, according to the National Statistics Office (NSO).
The forecast is below the Reserve Bank of India's (6.6%) and the government's estimate (6.5-7%) for the same period.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Some Key Economic Concepts
GDP Projections for FY25
Other Economic Indicators for FY25
Challenges for Sustained Growth
Implications of GDP Forecast and Way Forward
Conclusion
Some Key Economic Concepts:
Gross Domestic Product (GDP):
It is defined as the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period.
It measures the value of total output in the economy by tracking the
total demand.
GDP = C + I + G + NX
Consumption (C):
The biggest engine (56% of all GDP) is consumption demand from private individuals, technically known as Private Final Consumption Expenditure (
PFCE
Investment (I):
The second-biggest engine (32%) is the investment demand generated by private sector businesses, also known as Gross Fixed Capital Formation (
GFCF
Government (G):
The third engine (11%) is the demand for goods and services generated by the government and is known as the Government Final Consumption Expenditure (
GFCE
Net Exports (NX):
This is calculated by subtracting Indian imports from the Indian exports.
Nominal vs Real GDP:
Nominal GDP
(GDP calculated using current market prices) is the actual observed variable. However,
(GDP calculated using constant 2011-12 prices, after taking away the effect of inflation) is a derived metric.
Real GDP = Nominal GDP - Inflation Rate.
Inflation is the rate at which the value of a currency is falling and consequently the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.
From the
Budget-making perspective
, nominal GDP is important. However, from the
perspective of the common people
, real GDP is what matters.
Gross Value Added (GVA):
It examines the amount of value added (in monetary terms) in various productive areas of the economy. It tracks the total output in the economy by looking at the
total supply.
GDP vs GVA:
GDP = (GVA) + (Taxes earned by the government) - (Subsidies provided by the government). The difference between these two absolute figures will reveal the government's role in the process.
For example,
GDP > GVA
, if the government generated more money from taxes than it spent on subsidies.
GVA > GDP
, if the government gave subsidies in excess of its tax collections.
Fiscal deficit:
A fiscal deficit is a shortfall in a government's income compared with its spending.
It is essentially a marker of the
health of government finances
and tracks the amount of money that a government has to
borrow from the market
to meet its expenses.
GDP Projections for FY25:
Nominal vs. Real GDP:
Nominal GDP:
Expected at ₹324 lakh crore (9.7% growth), translating to $3.8 trillion at an exchange rate of ₹85 per USD.
Estimated at ₹184.9 lakh crore, 57% of nominal GDP, accounting for inflation effects.
Factors behind the sluggish growth:
(Economic slowdown drivers)
Cyclical slowdown:
Indian economy faces a downturn in growth momentum over the past three quarters.
Key influences:
Strong base effect.
Impact of general elections.
Weak private sector capital expenditure (capex).
Monetary and fiscal tightening measures.
Other Economic Indicators for FY25:
Sectoral performance:
Primary and secondary sectors:
Agriculture:
GVA growth rises to 3.8% in FY25 (1.4% in FY24).
Manufacturing:
GVA growth dips to 5.3% from 9.9% in FY24.
Electricity, gas, and utilities:
Growth slows to 6.8% (7.5% in FY24).
Construction:
Grows at 8.6% (9.9% in FY24).
Mining and quarrying
: Grows at 2.9%, down from 7.1% in FY24.
Services:
Estimated growth at 7.2%, led by public administration (9.1%).
Trade, hotels, and transport:
Growth slows to 5.8% (6.4% in FY24).
Financial and professional services:
Grows at 7.3% (8.4% in FY24).
Consumption and investment trends:
Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE):
Expected to grow at 7.3% (4% in FY24).
Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF):
Growth moderates to 6.4% from 9.0% in FY24.
Government spending and fiscal impact:
Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE)
growth rises to 4.1% in FY25 from 2.5% in FY24.
Lower nominal GDP growth (9.7%) compared to budget estimates may not significantly impact fiscal deficit targets.
Challenges for Sustained Growth:
Key engines of GDP showing sluggish growth.
Private consumption:
Slow CAGR of 4.8% since FY20 hinders growth.
Government spending:
Limited fiscal expansion since 2019 (CAGR of 3.1%).
Investments:
Stagnation in private and public sector capex since 2014 (CAGR of 5.3%).
Net exports:
Persistent trade deficit, although narrowing in FY25.
Implications and Way Forward:
Insights for policymakers:
The latest GDP data underscores a deceleration in economic growth.
While India has shown high growth rates post-pandemic, much of this was due to statistical base effects.
A closer look at long-term trends reveals real economic growth of less than 5% annually since FY20, far below the 7% average required to achieve developed country status by 2047.
Strategic interventions needed:
Boost private consumption to encourage investments.
Enhance public sector capex to revitalize economic growth.
Leverage rural demand and improve urban wage growth.
Conclusion:
India's GDP growth trajectory in FY25 highlights pressing structural challenges.
While government spending and rural demand offer some support, a holistic approach addressing consumption, investments, and trade is critical to sustaining long-term growth.

**********More flexibility, but also greater challenges
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Education system;
Why in the News?
The latest guidelines from the University Grants Commission (UGC) mark a significant transformation in India’s higher education system.
What are the Draft Guidelines by UGC in 2025?
The University Grants Commission (UGC) has introduced new draft guidelines for undergraduate education in India, which include:
Accelerated Degree Programmes (ADP):
This allows students to complete their degrees faster by earning additional credits per semester. Students can opt for this after their first or second semester based on their academic performance. A three-year degree can be completed in five semesters, while a four-year degree can be finished in six or seven semesters.
Extended Degree Programmes (EDP):
This option enables students facing personal or academic challenges to extend their study duration, allowing them to take fewer credits per semester. There is no upper limit on the number of students who can enroll in EDP, unlike ADP, which may have a cap of 10% of the sanctioned intake.
What are the advantages of adapting new guidelines?
Greater Flexibility:
The new guidelines allow for biannual admissions, enabling students to enroll in higher education programs twice a year. This flexibility helps students who may have missed the initial admission cycle or face personal challenges, reducing the risk of losing an entire academic year.
Multiple Entry and Exit Options:
Students can now enter and exit programs as needed, which accommodates various life circumstances and promotes lifelong learning. This approach aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020’s emphasis on inclusivity and adaptability.
Holistic Development:
The guidelines promote multidisciplinary learning by allowing students to earn credits in skill development, apprenticeships, or other subjects outside their major discipline. This fosters a more well-rounded educational experience.
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL):
The introduction of RPL allows individuals to gain formal recognition for skills and knowledge acquired through informal or experiential learning. This enhances career prospects and supports the integration of informal workers into the education system.
Alignment with Global Standards:
By adopting these flexible structures, Indian higher education can better align with international practices, improving student mobility both within India and abroad.
What are the challenges in adapting new guidelines?
Administrative Complexity:
Implementing these new guidelines requires significant changes to existing administrative structures and processes within higher education institutions (HEIs). This can be daunting for institutions already facing resource constraints.
Quality Assurance Concerns:
There are concerns about maintaining educational quality and rigor, especially in accelerated programs where the curriculum is compressed. This could lead to superficial understanding of key concepts among students.
Equity Issues:
Students from underprivileged backgrounds may struggle to navigate the new system without adequate support, potentially leading to higher dropout rates if they cannot keep pace with peers.
Faculty Adaptation:
Educators will need professional development to adjust to new pedagogical models that emphasize flexibility and interdisciplinary learning. The success of these reforms depends not only on student adaptation but also on faculty capability to support diverse learning needs effectively.
What are the practical issues?
Curriculum Restructuring:
Implementing these new formats requires significant changes to existing curricula and teaching methodologies, which could strain resources at many institutions.
Administrative Frameworks:
Institutions must develop robust systems for tracking student progress, managing credit transfers, and recognizing academic achievements effectively.
Digital Divide:
The shift towards digitalization in education could exacerbate inequalities among students from different socio-economic backgrounds if adequate support systems are not established.
Faculty Development:
Educators will need professional development to adapt to new teaching models that emphasize flexibility and interdisciplinary learning.
Way forward:
