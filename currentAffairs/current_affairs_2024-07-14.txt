India-Russia trade gap and rupee internationalization efforts
Why in news?
New Delhi aims to enhance bilateral trade with Moscow to $100 billion by 2030 to curb its rising oil import bill and reduce dependence on the US dollar.
However, since the Ukraine war in 2022, India-Russia trade dynamics have become skewed. Russia is now India’s top oil supplier, but Indian exports to Russia have lagged,
leading to a $57 billion trade deficit out of a $66 billion bilateral trade in FY24
While India has saved over $10 billion by importing cheaper Russian oil and benefited from exporting petroleum products made from Urals crude, the low exports to Russia have hindered India's goal to reduce dependence on the US dollar.
Continued unbalanced trade might compel India to use the Chinese yuan, undermining efforts to internationalize the rupee.

About
Internationalisation of the rupee is a process that involves increasing use of the local currency in cross-border transactions.
Basically, it is a process of promoting and increasing the use of the INR as a widely accepted currency for international transactions and investments.
It involves enhancing the currency's acceptance, liquidity, and usability in global markets.
Steps taken to promote international trade settlement in rupees
In July 2022, the RBI has provided an additional arrangement for invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/imports in the rupee.
As part of this mechanism, in December 2022, India saw its first settlement of foreign trade in rupee with Russia.
So far banks of 19 countries including the UK, New Zealand, Germany, Malaysia, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates have been permitted to make settlements in rupees.
How can India internationalise the rupee?
The
FY23 Economic Survey
highlights that a prerequisite for an international currency is its increasing use for trade invoicing.
The BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022 shows the US dollar as the dominant currency, making up 88% of global forex turnover, while the
rupee accounts for only 1.6%
The survey suggests that
if the rupee's turnover reaches 4%—
the share of non-US, non-Euro currencies in global forex turnover—it will be considered an international currency.
China has capitalized on export opportunities in Russia amid Western sanctions and the exit of Western companies, with
Chinese exports to Russia growing faster than imports of Russian oil
In 2023, Chinese shipments to Russia increased by 47% year-on-year to $111 billion, while imports grew by 13% to $129 billion, leading to a record two-way trade of $240 billion.
This balanced trade has encouraged the use of domestic currencies, with 95% of China-Russia trade occurring in local currencies.
Consequently,
the yuan has become the most sought-after currency in the Russian stock market, surpassing the US dollar
Russian oil exports now request payments from Indian refineries in yuan, while the use of the rupee remains limited
The primary challenge in facilitating trade with Russia is the reluctance of private banks to engage due to fears of Western sanctions, as many have significant business interests and branches in Western countries.
To address this, a joint statement following Prime Minister Modi's visit emphasized the need to increase Indian exports to Russia by strengthening industrial cooperation.
Indian exporters are also facing difficulties using the rupee settlement mechanism while trading with Russia.
Exporters initially complained that although the RBI had launched the mechanism, they were unable to use it due to the absence of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for banks.
Additionally, the volatility of the ruble and rupee, unlike the more stable yuan, further complicates trade in domestic currencies.
During the recent visit of PM Modi, India and Russia agreed to eliminate trade barriers and initiate negotiations for a trade deal with the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), which includes Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia, representing a $5 trillion economy.
They decided to cooperate in manufacturing sectors such as transport engineering, metallurgy, and chemicals, and to implement joint projects in priority areas.
The aim is to expand reciprocal trade flows of industrial products to increase their share in bilateral trade.
Discussions also covered a migration and mobility partnership agreement between the two countries.

**********Militancy on the rise in Jammu
Why in news?
Recent terrorist attacks in the Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) highlight a significant challenge for the Indian government.
On July 8, five Army soldiers were killed and five injured in an ambush by militants. This incident is part of a troubling trend, with five terror strikes in the Jammu division since June 9, resulting in the deaths of eight security personnel and 10 civilians.
These attacks indicate a shift in militant focus from the traditionally volatile Kashmir Valley to the previously more peaceful Jammu region.
What’s in today’s article
New pattern emerging
Reasons behind this new emerging pattern
Way forward
Attempts to revive militancy in the Jammu region since the past three years
The recent attacks reflect a concerning pattern of renewed militancy in the Jammu region over the past three years, particularly in the Chenab Valley and south of the Pir Panjal.
Districts such as Doda, Kishtwar, Ramban, Kathua, Udhampur, Reasi, Rajouri, and Poonch have seen a resurgence in militant activity.
While the Kashmir Valley has historically experienced frequent terror incidents,
the Jammu belt has been relatively peaceful for the past two decades
This revival of militancy in an area that was a hotbed in the late 1990s and early 2000s has alarmed the security establishment.
Statistics
Since 2021, the Jammu region has experienced 31 terror incidents, resulting in the deaths of 47 security forces and 19 civilians, along with 48 terrorists killed.
In contrast, the Kashmir Valley has reported 263 terror incidents, with 68 security forces and 75 civilians killed, and 417 terrorists neutralized.
While the number of incidents in Jammu is significantly lower than in the Valley, the increased frequency and targeted nature of attacks on pilgrims and security forces in Jammu are particularly concerning.
How is the infiltration happening?
The 192-km international border (IB) along Jammu is secured by the Border Security Force (BSF), while the 740-km Line of Control (LoC) in the Kashmir Valley and parts of Jammu is under Army control.
Despite security measures, tough terrain, forested areas along the LoC, and vulnerable patches along the IB may have facilitated fresh infiltration.
The recent attacks in the Kathua belt, including the July 8 ambush, occurred on an old infiltration route used by militants two decades ago.
Thinning of the security grid after Galwan incident
After the 2020 Galwan clashes in eastern Ladakh, which resulted in the deaths of 20 soldiers, a significant number of Army personnel were redeployed from Jammu to the China border, weakening the security grid in Jammu.
Security experts suggest that this has made the region more vulnerable to attacks.
India is being engaged at two fronts
Hostile elements aim to strain India on both the western (Pakistan) and northern (China) fronts.
With heightened alert in the Kashmir Valley and reduced opportunities for state-sponsored terrorists there, Jammu, with its lowered guard, becomes a more convenient target.
Aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370
Following the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, the government has touted successes in the Kashmir Valley, evidenced by zero stone-throwing incidents, no strikes, and a tourism boom.
However, renewed terrorism in Jammu challenges this narrative and might aim to stabilize militant presence in the Valley while stirring insecurity in Jammu.
Demography of the region
The area's demography also raises concerns about potential communal tensions and social unrest due to these attacks.
Opportunities for terrorists in Jammu region
The Rajouri-Poonch area had a thinner concentration of security forces.
This region is equidistant from Shopian and Kulgam in Kashmir, and the Line of Control with Pakistan,
making it easier to move between the three regions
It was highly unlikely that security forces and police from all three regions would simultaneously launch an operation against the militants.
Areas in the Pir Panjal range and to its south are also easier to access
Any militant crossing over from the lower heights of Jammu have to traverse through multiple high ranges like Pir Panjal before they reach Kashmir Valley.
This challenges their logistical preparations and motivation.
Hence shorter and intense contacts have become the norm in the Jammu region
Terror incidents away from the Valley, where militant ranks have been staring at a leadership vacuum, are high visibility strikes, intended to inflict maximum damage.
Drying up of the human intelligence
One of the reasons why forces may have not been able to anticipate the attacks is the
drying up of the human intelligence or their network of informers
Human intelligence is very important in counter-insurgency operations.
Even with all their reliance on gadgets and smart ways to avoid surveillance, the terrorists visit the nearest human settlement in order to get logistical support for their survival.
This is where the role of human intelligence becomes important.
While militants and their network of overground workers continue to exist, the informers are missing.
Many security experts attribute the dried-up human intelligence to
authorities taking the prevailing peace for guaranteed
As per them, the new officers who got transferred to the region didn’t work as hard as they should have on their informer network.
A whole generation that fought the terrorists are in their 60s and 70s now. There is no such connect with the younger generation, it will take time to build that trust with the civilians.
The Village Defence Guards/Committees (VDGs) are also being revived since December 2022.
The VDGs had to be discontinued amid allegations of crimes such as abduction and rape committed by the members.

**********Guidelines to Prevent Stereotyping and Discrimination of PwDs
Why in News?
The Supreme Court in a landmark ruling laid down comprehensive guidelines to prevent stereotyping and discrimination of persons with disabilities (PwDs) in visual media, including films and documentaries.
The SC issued guidelines while hearing a plea to ban the film Aaankh Micholi for derogatory portrayal of PwDs. However, the SC refused to interfere with CBFC's decision to clear movie for public screening.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the SC’s Ruling Against the Insensitive Representation of PwDs?
What is the Significance of the Ruling?
What are the Shortcomings of the Ruling?
Way Forward - 7-Points Guidelines to Prevent Stereotyping and Discrimination of PwDs
The SC emphasised the
need for authentic and respectful representation
of individuals with disabilities in films and media.
The bench highlighted the
importance of inclusivity and realism
in cinematic portrayals, underlining the societal impact of such representations.
The SC said that the creative freedom
of the filmmaker cannot include the freedom to lampoon, stereotype, misrepresent or disparage those already marginalised.
The court recognised the
influential role of cinema in shaping public perceptions
and stressed that inaccurate or stereotypical portrayals can perpetuate harmful misconceptions.
According to
Article 14
of the Indian Constitution, stereotyping is an antithesis of dignity and anti-discrimination rule.
Therefore, there must be a clear distinction between ‘
disability humour
’ which helps in understanding the disabled and ‘
disablement humour
’ which denigrates it.
The ruling has been welcomed by the industry insiders and disability rights activists as a
crucial step towards changing the narrative around disability in India
The ruling also aligns with the broader goals of
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD)
Act 2016,
which seeks to protect and promote the rights and dignity of PwDs in all spheres of life.
The SC emphasised on the
human rights
model of disability rights, making the government and private parties obliged to facilitate full and effective participation of PwDs in society.
Models under which disability rights are looked at, are of two types -
medical and social models.
The human rights model
is an evolution of the social model and says that people with disability are a part of society and have the same rights as everyone else.
The human rights model is an abstract idea and difficult to implement.
The guidelines are limited to visual media.
The judgement may go against the spirit of ‘
creative freedom.’
Way Forward - 7-Points Guidelines to Prevent Stereotyping and Discrimination of PwDs:
The SC expects filmmakers to adhere to these 7-point guidelines while representing PwDs in the visual media.
The 7-point guidelines are -
To avoid words (like words crippled, etc) which lead to institutional discrimination and
negative self-image.
To avoid language
which overlooks the social barriers.
Creators must check for
adequate medical info
about an impairment like night blindness which may increase discrimination.
Such info should not be based on myths
. For example, stereotypes show that impaired persons have enhanced sensory superpowers.
Creators must practice the principle of “
nothing about us, without us
,” and involve PwDs in the creation and assessment of visual media content.
As per the convention to protect rights of PWDs, PwDs must be portrayed in the visual media after consultation with their
rights advocacy groups
There must be
training and sensitisation programmes
for creators.
