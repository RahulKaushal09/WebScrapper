NANDALAL BOSE
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – ART & CULTURE
Context:
3rd December marked the birth anniversary of Nandalal Bose, who is recognized as one of the pioneers of modern Indian art and a prominent figure in the neo-Bengal school.
Background: –
Bose played a significant role in training generations of artists. He was greatly admired by his contemporaries and inspired his students to draw inspiration from both nature and various art traditions, just as he did.
Key takeaways
Born in Munger, Bihar, on December 3, 1882, Bose was one of the greatest exponents of modern art.
He was mentored by Abanindranath Tagore and was renowned for his distinctive “Indian style” of painting. In 1922, he became the principal of Kala Bhavan in Santiniketan.
His influences encompassed many styles, including Japanese Nihonga traditions, Mughal and Rajasthani miniatures, palm-leaf manuscripts, and murals found in the Ajanta Caves.
Notable Works: Some of his famous works include “Yama and Savitri” (1913) and “Kirat-Arjuna”.
During a period when India’s artistic traditions had significantly diminished due to years of British colonial rule, Nandalal Bose played a pivotal role in the cultural regeneration and independence of the nation through his contributions in art and education.
Nandalal Bose passed away in 1966, in Santiniketan, West Bengal. He received numerous accolades including the Padma Vibhushan. The National Gallery of Modern Art houses over 6,800 of his works in its collection.
Archaeological Survey of India has recognised the works of Nandalal Bose as “art treasures” under the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act of 1972.

RATAPANI TIGER RESERVE
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
The Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh was declared a tiger reserve following in-principle approval from the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change through the National Tiger Conservation Authority.
This development comes against the backdrop of Madhav National Park (Madhya Pradesh) also receiving approval to be declared a tiger reserve.
Ratapani is the 57th tiger reserve in India, marking a significant step in tiger conservation efforts
The notification delineates the core and buffer areas, making Ratapani the eighth tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh.
The core area spans 763.8 square kilometers, while the buffer area covers 507.6 square kilometers, making the total area of the Ratapani Tiger Reserve 1,271.4 square kilometers.
The notification was issued under Section 38V of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, acknowledging the core area as a critical tiger habitat.
Sitting in the lap of the Vindhya hills, the sanctuary encompasses a World Heritage Site – the Bhimbetka Rock Shelters – and many historical and religious destinations.

LAND DEGRADATION IS THREATENING EARTH’S CAPACITY TO SUSTAIN HUMANITY
Prelims & Mains – ENVIRONMENT
Land degradation is undermining Earth’s capacity to sustain humanity, and failure to reverse it will pose challenges for generations to come, a new United Nations report found.
The analysis has been carried out by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) — a legally binding framework to address desertification — in collaboration with Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
According to UNCCD, land degradation is the reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of rainfed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands resulting from a combination of pressures, including land use and management practices.
A million sq km of land is getting degraded each year, with an estimated 15 million sq km already impacted — more than the entire continent of Antarctica — by land degradation, the report titled Stepping back from the precipice: Transforming land management to stay within planetary boundaries said.
What is causing land degradation?
Unsustainable agricultural practices such as the heavy use of chemical inputs, pesticides, and water diversion are the foremost drivers of land degradation, the report said. That is because such practices lead to deforestation, soil erosion, and pollution.
Another factor is climate change. Global warming has worsened land degradation by increasing frequency, intensity and/ or amount of heavy precipitation, and increased heat stress.
Then there is rapid urbanisation, which has intensified land degradation by contributing to habitat destruction, pollution, and biodiversity loss.
Impacts of Land Degradation
Human Health and Nutrition
Reduces the quality and quantity of food production, increasing the risk of malnutrition.
Contributes to water- and food-borne diseases due to poor hygiene and scarcity of clean water.
Causes respiratory diseases from soil erosion.
Impact on Marine and Freshwater Systems
Eroded soil carrying fertilizers and pesticides contaminates water bodies.
Harms aquatic fauna and affects local communities dependent on these ecosystems.
Contribution to Climate Change
Degraded soil releases carbon (CO2 and nitrous oxide), intensifying global warming.
Soil, a major terrestrial carbon sink, loses its ability to sequester carbon.
Reduced Carbon Absorption by Ecosystems
Land ecosystems’ capacity to absorb human-caused CO2 has declined by 20% in the last decade.
Previously, these ecosystems absorbed nearly one-third of human-caused emissions.

WORLD WILDLIFE CONSERVATION DAY
Let’s have a look at India’s wildlife on World Wildlife Conservation Day.
World Wildlife Conservation Day is observed annually on December 4th. The day highlights the critical challenges facing wildlife populations, including extinction, endangerment, and illegal wildlife trade.
Despite possessing only 2.4% of the world’s land area, India accounts for 7-8% of all recorded species, which includes 45,000 species of plants and 91,000 of animals. This rich biodiversity is one of the reasons that it has been identified as a megadiverse country.
India has 10 biogeographic zones and is home to 8.58% of the mammalian species documented so far, with the corresponding figures for avian species being 13.66%, for reptiles 7.91%, for amphibians 4.66%, for fish 11.72% and for plants 11.8%.
Four of the 34 globally identified biodiversity hotspots, namely the Himalayas, Indo-Burma, the Western Ghats-Sri Lanka and Sundaland, are located in India.
Risk of extinction
There are 73 “critically endangered” species in India as of 2022 — the most updated estimates made available by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies species as critically endangered when they are at the highest risk of extinction in the wild. The number of critically endangered species has risen from 47 in 2011, though this also due to improvements in data availability and monitoring and not entirely due to animals of a species getting decimated.
Of the nine species of mammals considered critically endangered, eight are endemic, which means that their habitat is limited to a small geographic area within India. These include the Kashmir stag or Hangul, Malabar large-spotted civet, Andaman Shrew, Jenkin’s shrew, Nicobar shrew, Namdapha flying squirrel, large rock rat and Leafletted leaf-nosed bat.

**********Why Scrutiny of Lower Fertility Rates Is Not the Answer to the Delimitation Crisis
Context
India's population dynamics remain a focal point of discussion
, particularly with the prospect of the Census being conducted next year and the
subsequent delimitation of parliamentary seats.
Recent remarks by the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu,
advocating for
increased birth rates to avoid political disadvantages
, reflect underlying concerns about the implications of population growth on representation and resource allocation.
While such statements might not be serious policy recommendations, they highlight the complexities of balancing demographic trends
with political and economic imperatives.
Population Growth, Political Representation and Resource Allocation
Population Growth and Political Representation
India’s federal structure amplifies the political consequences of population growth
disparities among states.
The
delimitation of parliamentary constituencies, which determines the representation of states in Parliament, has been frozen since 1976
to prevent penalizing states that have successfully reduced their fertility rates.
This freeze, extended in 2001 for another 25 years
, aims to maintain fairness.
However,
as the freeze approaches its end, debates emerge on whether to extend it further or explore alternative electoral systems
, such as allocating seats based on vote share.
While the
latter option may seem innovative, it faces feasibility challenges
and questions about its appropriateness.
For now, extending the freeze appears to be the most pragmatic solution
, maintaining the political balance and rewarding states that have worked toward stabilizing their populations.
Population and Resource Allocation
Population figures
significantly
influence the distribution of central resources to states.
Historically,
the Finance Commission used the 1971 population figures for its calculations
, aligning with the delimitation freeze.
However, the 14th and 15th Finance Commissions shifted to using current population data
, introducing a compensatory variable called demographic change.
measure accounts for efforts made by states in reducing fertility rates
, striking a balance in resource allocation.
For instance,
under the 15th Finance Commission, population was given a weight of 15%, while demographic change received 12.5%,
ensuring fairness to progressive states.
Necessary Measures to Mitigate Population Disparity Among States
Addressing Economic Disparity
Economic disparities among Indian states
with varying population growth
rates represent a significant challenge to national development and cohesion.
States with high population growth
often face lagging economic development, exacerbating inequality
and fuelling regional tensions.
Bridging this gap requires a multi-faceted approach that focuses on creating inclusive economic growth
, improving infrastructure, and addressing systemic disadvantages in underperforming regions.
Aspirational Districts Programme
One of the key strategies for addressing these disparities is to
enhance the effectiveness of targeted development initiatives.
, for instance, focuses on improving socioeconomic indicators in the most backward districts by prioritizing health, education, and infrastructure.
While this initiative has made progress,
its impact can be amplified through better monitoring, increased funding, and integration
with other development programs.
A tailored approach that considers the unique challenges of each district,
such as geography, resource availability, and demographic trends,
is essential for sustainable progress.
Infrastructure Development
Investments in
infrastructure development
are also crucial. Many states with high population growth rates lack adequate infrastructure, hindering industrialisation and economic diversification.
By prioritising investments in roads, railways, power supply, and digital connectivity, the government can create a conducive environment
for businesses to thrive.
This, in turn, can attract private investment, create jobs, and stimulate local economies.
Special economic zones (SEZs) and industrial corridors in these regions could further accelerate development
and reduce economic disparities.
Education and Skill Development
States with high population growth often have lower levels of literacy
and skill attainment, limiting their workforce's ability to participate in modern industries.
Expanding access to quality education, vocational training, and skill-building programs
tailored to local economies
can significantly uplift these regions.
Initiatives such as the Skill India Mission should prioritise states with lagging development to prepare their workforce for emerging opportunities
in sectors like technology, manufacturing, and services.
Agricultural Innovation
Additionally, developing
agricultural innovation
is critical for states where a significant portion of the population depends on agriculture.
Providing access to modern farming techniques, irrigation systems,
and market linkages
can enhance productivity and incomes for rural households.
Promoting diversification into high-value crops and agro-industries can also create additional employment opportunities.
Collaboration between Centre and States
Collaboration between the central and state governments is vital in formulating and implementing these strategies.
States need greater autonomy in designing development programs
while receiving adequate financial and technical support from the central government.
A robust monitoring mechanism
that evaluates the impact of these initiatives in real-time
can ensure accountability and enable timely course corrections.
The Role of Finance Commission in Addressing the Economic Disparity
The Finance Commission plays a critical role
in addressing disparities through resource allocation.
By incorporating variables such as demographic change alongside population figures, it has made strides in incentivising states
that have effectively controlled their fertility rates.
more dynamic resource allocation frameworks could be designed to address the specific needs
of states with high population growth.
For example,
allocating funds for skill development programs, small-scale industry promotion, and agricultural modernisation could directly enhance economic opportunities
in these regions.
Way Forward
A Multi-Pronged Approach
India's population is projected to peak at 170 crores by 2070
before declining.
Currently,
the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) nationwide stands at 2, just below the replacement rate of 2.1
significant disparities exist among states
, with TFRs ranging from 1.5 to 3.
Efforts to harmonise these rates must focus on reducing high TFRs
rather than increasing low ones.
Encouraging higher fertility in low-TFR states is counterproductive
, given India's overpopulation and the economic challenges it already faces.
Accelerate Fertility Decline in High-TFR States
The priority should be to accelerate fertility decline in high-TFR states
through two key strategies: empowering women and improving reproductive health services.
Empowering women reduces the demand for large families
, while better reproductive health services enable couples to achieve their desired family size.
Notably,
only five states currently have a TFR above 2.1,
making targeted interventions feasible and impactful.
Towards Harmonious Relations
Large socioeconomic disparities among states
with varying population growth rates
pose risks to national harmony.
Addressing these differences requires a multi-pronged approach
that combines political, economic, and social measures.
Extending the delimitation freeze, refining resource allocation criteria
, promoting economic development in lagging states, and reducing fertility rates in high-TFR regions are
all essential components of a comprehensive response.
Conclusion
India's demographic transition
presents both
challenges and opportunities.
By adopting thoughtful and equitable policies
the nation can navigate these complexities
and ensure balanced development that benefits all its citizens.
Success in managing population growth must be celebrated, not penalised
, as a cornerstone of sustainable progress.

**********Evaluating India's Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme
Why in News?
While some sectors have shown encouraging results under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, others lag in meeting targets, prompting reviews and potential adjustments.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the PLI Scheme?
Evaluating Progress, Challenges and Potential of the PLI Scheme
Conclusion
About:
The PLI scheme was
launched
(in March, 2020)
to boost India’s domestic manufacturing base and enhance its global supply chain contribution
Objective:
Covering 14 sectors, the scheme aims to create
significant employment opportunities and drive industrial capital expenditure (capex)
How does it work?
Under the PLI scheme,
eligible companies receive financial incentives
based on their incremental sales from products manufactured in India.
These incentives
encourage companies to invest
in upgrading their manufacturing capabilities, adopting modern technologies, and expanding their production capacities.
How is PLI different from other traditional subsidies?
Only limited sectors are eligible:
The scheme has the potential to attract maximum investments and scale rapidly to provide the maximum returns in terms of incremental production, employment, and export.
Time-bound pre-committed levels of investment and productions:
Hence, cannot be called a subsidy scheme.
Focus on supporting upcoming technologies:
That can be commercialised at a large scale like advanced chemistry cell batteries, electronic and technology products.
Evaluating Progress, Challenges and Potential of the PLI Scheme:
Mixed progress across sectors:
Sectors lagging in employment generation:
Textiles, solar modules, IT hardware, automobiles
, advanced chemical cells (ACC), and specialty steel have seen relatively slow progress in creating jobs.
Initial challenges stem from the need to build domestic manufacturing capabilities from scratch.
Successful sectors:
Food processing and mobile phone manufacturing
have exceeded expectations.
For instance
, smartphone exports reached $15 billion in 2023-24, driven by companies like Apple expanding assembly operations in India.
Initial challenges and emerging benefits:
Challenges:
Developing manufacturing industries from scratch
in certain sectors.
Stringent eligibility criteria, reliance on imported machinery, and high tariffs have been deterrents.
Time-consuming commissioning processes
in sectors like solar modules and ACC, which require 1.5–3 years to set up.
Emerging benefits:
Sectors like mobile manufacturing show a ripple effect,
with large companies like Apple spurring ancillary industries and creating opportunities for smaller suppliers.
For instance,
Apple now sources components from 14 Indian suppliers
compared to none prior to the PLI scheme.
Economic potential:
According to CRISIL, the PLI scheme
could drive ₹3-3.5 lakh crore in industrial capital expenditure over its duration
, contributing 8–10% of total capex in key sectors over the next 3–4 years.
Critical perspectives:
Critics argue that the PLI scheme may function as a subsidy without guaranteeing long-term competitiveness once incentives end.
Way ahead:
Sectoral adjustments:
IT hardware recently received an upgraded outlay. Renewals or adjustments are under consideration for sectors like textiles and drones.
Potential revisions:
Revising eligibility criteria and increasing support in underperforming sectors.
Emphasising employment-linked outcomes in sectors with slow initial traction
Conclusion:
Challenges in underperforming sectors highlight the
need for fine-tuning policies to achieve long-term goals
of industrial growth, employment, and competitiveness.
As the government recalibrates the framework,
sustained engagement with stakeholders and addressing structural bottlenecks
will be key to realising the scheme’s full potential.

**********What UK’s assisted dying bill says, how it compares to Indian law
Why in news?
The
Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill
was introduced in the UK to provide terminally ill patients with the option to seek assistance to end their lives. The Bill addresses ethical and humanitarian concerns for patients with no hope of recovery, ensuring dignity in their final days.
The Bill was backed by a majority of 330 to 275, with 38 MPs not voting. The Bill will now be sent to a public bill committee which will vote on any proposed amendments before being voted on again in the House of Commons.
It will then be sent to the House of Lords, where further changes could be made, before a final vote is held.
What’s in today’s article?
Assisted Dying and debate around it
What is the current UK law on this issue?
What is the procedure provided in the bill?
How does it compare to the law in India?
Definition
Assisted dying
generally refers to a person who is terminally ill receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves.
Assisted suicide
is intentionally helping another person to end their life, including someone who is not terminally ill.
That could involve providing lethal medication or helping them travel to another jurisdiction to die.
Euthanasia
is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering in which a lethal drug is administered by a physician/doctor.
Patients may not be terminally ill.
There are two types: voluntary euthanasia, where a patient consents; and non-voluntary, where they cannot because, for example, they are in a coma.
Arguments in Favor of Assisted Dying
Control and Dignity
: Allows terminally ill patients to choose a humane way to end their suffering.
Limitations of End-of-Life Care
: Proponents argue that such care often fails to alleviate pain and symptoms effectively.
Suicide Prevention
: A legal framework could deter impulsive suicides and prevent family members from being involved in illegal assistance.
Arguments Against Assisted Dying
Risk of Misuse
: Potential for coercion, especially among vulnerable groups like the elderly and disabled.
Impact on Vulnerable Populations
: Detractors fear it could lead to undue pressure on patients to opt for assisted dying.
Focus on Care Improvements
: Critics advocate for enhancing end-of-life care instead of legalizing assisted dying.
Current UK Law
Both assisted dying and euthanasia are prohibited. Assisted suicide is a punishable offence with up to 14 years in prison.
History of Assisted Dying Bills in the UK
Since 2013, at least three bills have been introduced to legalize assisted dying.
The debate remains polarised, reflecting deep ethical and social concerns.
Eligibility Criteria for Assisted Dying
Age and Residency
: Patient must be 18 or older, mentally capable, and residing in England or Wales for at least 12 months.
Terminal Illness Definition
: The illness must be irreversible, worsening, and likely to cause death within six months.
Exclusions
: Persons with disabilities or mental disorders are explicitly excluded.
Initial Request and Assessment Process
First Declaration
Patient signs in the presence of a coordinating doctor and a witness.
Coordinating doctor conducts a first assessment to confirm eligibility and voluntariness.
Independent Assessment
Request is referred to an independent doctor for verification after a minimum seven-day reflection period.
Disagreements between doctors may lead to a referral to another independent doctor (only once).
Judicial Review
If both doctors approve, the request is sent to the High Court of Justice for verification of compliance.
High Court may question the patient and doctors.
Rejections can be challenged in the Court of Appeal.
Final Confirmation and Administration
Second Period of Reflection
A 14-day waiting period follows High Court or Court of Appeal approval.
Patient signs a second declaration, witnessed by the coordinating doctor, the independent doctor, and a third person.
Self-Administration
Approved substance is provided to the patient by the coordinating doctor or designated practitioner.
Patient must self-administer the substance; the doctor is prohibited from administering it.
Supreme Court of India’s Recognition of Passive Euthanasia
In Common Cause v. Union of India (2018), the Supreme Court ruled that the “
right to die with dignity
” is
part of the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution
Legality of
passive euthanasia
was established, allowing withdrawal of life support for terminally ill patients or those in a permanent vegetative state.
Passive euthanasia enables natural death without medical interventions, differing from assisted dying.
Guidelines for Passive Euthanasia
Living Will or Advance Medical Directive
Patients can leave directives for withdrawal of life support.
Must be signed in the presence of two witnesses and a Judicial Magistrate.
Approval Process
Requires consent from the treating physician, a medical board, and an external medical board with local administration representation.
Challenges and Modifications
In 2019, the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine sought changes, terming the guidelines cumbersome and impractical.
In 2023, the Supreme Court modified the guidelines to introduce strict timelines and reduce the involvement of the Judicial Magistrate.
Awareness and implementation of these guidelines remain limited across India.
Draft Guidelines by Ministry of Health (2024)
In August 2024, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued draft guidelines similar to the Supreme Court’s recommendations.

**********ICJ begins hearing on landmark climate change case
Why in news?
The annual climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, ended with disappointment for developing nations, as developed countries agreed to mobilize only $300 billion annually in climate finance, far below the $1.3 trillion demanded based on assessed needs. This decision highlights the ongoing failure of developed nations to meet their climate finance and emission reduction responsibilities.
In response, developing nations, especially small island states, have escalated the issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
On December 2, the ICJ began hearings on a case seeking an advisory opinion on the obligations of countries under international laws regarding climate change and the legal consequences of those obligations.
What’s in today’s article?
Background – the case
Significance of this hearing
About
The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN).
It was established in June 1945 by the Charter of the United Nations and began work in April 1946.
The seat of the Court is at the
Peace Palace in The Hague
(Netherlands).
It is the only one of the six principal organs of the UN that is not located in New York City.
English and French
are the ICJ’s official languages.
Role
to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and
to give
advisory opinions
on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies.
Judges
The ICJ has
15 judges
who are elected to
nine-year terms
by the UN General Assembly and Security Council, which vote simultaneously but separately.
The president and vice-president of the court are elected for three-year terms by secret ballot.
Judges are eligible for re-election
Members and Jurisdiction
All members of the UN are automatically parties to the ICJ statute. However, this does not automatically give the ICJ jurisdiction over disputes involving them.
ICJ gets jurisdiction only if both parties consent to it
The judgment of the
ICJ is final and technically binding
on the parties to a case.
There is no provision of appeal. It can at the most, be subject to interpretation or, upon the discovery of a new fact, revision.
UNGA Resolution Initiated by Vanuatu
The case stems from a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution passed in March 2023, led by Vanuatu, a small Pacific Island nation severely threatened by rising sea levels.
Vanuatu proposed seeking an ICJ advisory opinion on climate obligations in September 2021.
The resolution, co-sponsored by 132 countries, received broad international support.
India had not joined the overwhelming majority of countries that co-sponsored the draft resolution.
Key Questions Raised in the Resolution
The resolution seeks answers to two critical questions:
What are the obligations of countries under international law to protect the climate system?
What are the legal consequences for countries failing to meet these obligations and causing harm to the climate system?
Purpose of ICJ Advisory Opinion
The UNGA resolution requests the ICJ to clarify the climate obligations of countries in light of these international laws and assess the legal consequences for non-compliance.
Relevant International Legal Instruments dealing with the issue
While the 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 2015 Paris Agreement are central to climate law, the resolution also invokes other legal frameworks, including:
UN Convention on the Law of the Seas; Convention on Biological Diversity; Convention to Combat Desertification
Universal Declaration on Human Rights; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; UN Charter
India’s Role in the Hearings
India is scheduled to make its submission on December 5.
It should be noted that, India was among the countries which voiced concerns about whether launching a judicial process was the best way to reach shared goals.
Successfully tackling the climate crisis is best achieved via diplomatic efforts.
As per India, top-down approach is not needed in the discussion around climate change.
Nature and Potential Impact of the ICJ Advisory Opinion
The hearing aims to produce an advisory opinion based on the UNGA resolution.
While non-binding, the opinion could significantly influence global climate governance by broadening the legal basis for climate obligations and highlighting consequences for non-compliance.
Historical Context of Climate Obligations
Under the UNFCCC, about 40 developed countries were identified as primarily responsible for historical emissions.
However, these countries have largely evaded these responsibilities, often shifting some burdens onto developing nations.
Expanding the Basis of Climate Obligations
The ICJ ruling may show that developed nations’ climate obligations extend beyond the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement to other international legal frameworks.
This could introduce new arguments in climate negotiations and bolster small island states’ claims for compensation for climate-related damages.
Potential Precedent for Climate Litigation
An ICJ advisory opinion could strengthen thousands of climate lawsuits worldwide.
As of 2023, over 2,600 cases have been filed globally, with several landmark rulings already delivered.
For instance, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Switzerland’s failure to meet emission targets violated its citizens' human rights.
In April 2023,
India’s Supreme Court expanded fundamental rights to include protection from adverse climate impacts

**********How land degradation is threatening Earth’s capacity to sustain humanity?
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related to land degradation;
Why in the News?
The UNCCD, a treaty addressing desertification and drought, partnered with Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to release an analysis ahead of COP16’s launch in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
What is Land Degradation?
Land degradation is defined by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) as the “
reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity
and complexity of rainfed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands” due to various pressures, including land use and management practices. This phenomenon results in diminished soil quality and productivity, affecting both ecosystems and human livelihoods.
Why is it a Matter of Concern?
Land degradation poses significant risks to both humans and ecosystems:
Water Insecurity:
Land degradation exacerbates water scarcity and reduces access to safe water, leading to a higher incidence of water- and food-borne diseases.
World Health Organization (WHO) reports
that unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation lead to approximately 829,000 deaths per year from diarrheal diseases alone.
Food Security:
It reduces the quality and quantity of food production, increasing malnutrition risks.
Health Risks:
Degraded lands contribute to the spread of water- and food-borne diseases due to poor hygiene and lack of clean water. Respiratory issues can arise from soil erosion and dust.
Environmental Impact:
Eroded soil carries fertilizers and pesticides into water bodies, harming aquatic life and communities dependent on these resources.
Climate Change:
Healthy soils act as carbon sinks. Degradation leads to the release of stored carbon and nitrous oxide, exacerbating global warming. The report indicates that land ecosystems’ capacity to absorb human-caused carbon dioxide has decreased by 20% over the last decade.
What is Causing Land Degradation?
Chemical Overuse
: Excessive fertilisers and pesticides degrade soil;
50% of agricultural land
suffers from nutrient depletion, salinisation, and waterlogging affecting
30% of irrigated lands
globally.
Soil Erosion
: Unsustainable farming practices lead to the loss of
24 billion tons of fertile soil annually
, reducing crop yields by up to
50% in some regions
: Extreme weather events reduce global crop yields by
10%-50% by 2050
12.6% of drylands
were degraded between 1982-2015, affecting
213 million people
Urbanization
: Rapid urban growth of
1 million hectares per year
destroys habitats, reduces farmland, and increases runoff, exacerbating soil erosion and biodiversity loss.
Deforestation and Overgrazing
420 million hectares of forest lost since 1990
; overgrazing degrades
34% of the global degraded area
, weakening soil health and ecosystems.
Which Areas are the Worst Affected?
Dry Regions:
Areas such as South Asia, northern China, California (USA), and the Mediterranean are particularly vulnerable.
Global Context:
Approximately 15 million square kilometers of land are already degraded an area larger than Antarctica with an additional million square kilometers degrading each year. A third of humanity lives in drylands, which encompass three-quarters of Africa.
Way forward:
Sustainable Land Management Practices
: Promote eco-friendly agricultural methods, reforestation, and efficient irrigation to restore soil health, combat erosion, and improve water retention in degraded lands.
Global Collaboration and Policy Implementation
: Strengthen international frameworks like the UNCCD, allocate resources for affected regions, and adopt policies that integrate land restoration with climate resilience and biodiversity conservation.
Mains PYQ:
The process of desertification does not have climate boundaries. Justify with examples.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Banking Sector Reforms;
Why in the News?
On Tuesday, December 3, 2024, the Lok Sabha passed the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, marking the first piece of legislation to be approved during the Winter Session after the resolution of a week-long impasse.
What are the key features of the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024?
Nomination Provisions:
The Bill allows bank account holders to nominate up to four individuals for their accounts, with options for either successive or simultaneous nominations. However, locker holders will only have the option for successive nominations.
Redefinition of “Substantial Interest”:
The threshold for defining “substantial interest” for directorships is proposed to increase from ₹5 lakh to ₹2 crore, reflecting current economic conditions.
Tenure of Directors:
The tenure of directors (excluding chairpersons and whole-time directors) in cooperative banks will be extended from eight years to ten years, aligning with provisions in the Constitution (Ninety-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2011.
Common Directorships:
The Bill permits directors of Central Cooperative Banks to serve on the boards of State Cooperative Banks under certain conditions.
Auditor Remuneration:
It grants banks greater flexibility in determining the remuneration for statutory auditors, which was previously regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the central government.
Reporting Dates:
The reporting dates for regulatory compliance will shift from the second and fourth Fridays to the 15th and last day of every month, streamlining oversight processes.
What are the reasons for this amendment?
Enhancing Governance:
The amendments aim to strengthen governance standards within banks, ensuring better protection for depositors and investors while improving audit quality in public sector banks.
Customer Convenience:
By allowing multiple nominations, the Bill intends to simplify inheritance processes related to bank deposits and reduce instances of unclaimed deposits after an account holder’s demise.
Alignment with Constitutional Provisions:
Increasing director tenures in cooperative banks aligns banking regulations with constitutional amendments that govern cooperative societies.
What would be the significant impact of this amendment?
Improved Customer Experience:
The ability to nominate multiple individuals enhances customer convenience and ensures smoother transitions in account management after an account holder’s death.
Strengthened Governance Framework:
By redefining substantial interest and increasing director tenures, the Bill aims to foster a more robust governance framework within cooperative banks, potentially leading to better decision-making and accountability.
Regulatory Compliance Efficiency:
Changing reporting dates is expected to improve compliance efficiency, allowing banks to better align their reporting practices with regulatory requirements.
What is the criticism faced by the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024?
Concerns Over Financial Practices:
Opposition leaders raised concerns regarding rising imports from China amid strained relations and questioned broader financial practices like demonetization and electoral bonds.
Banking Fees and Cybersecurity Risks:
Critics highlighted issues related to fees for basic banking services such as ATM withdrawals and SMS alerts, particularly emphasizing vulnerabilities faced by senior citizens concerning cyber fraud.
Economic Context:
Some opposition members criticized the timing of the Bill against a backdrop of economic challenges such as inflation exceeding growth rates, potentially leading to stagflation. They expressed skepticism about whether these amendments would effectively address underlying economic issues.
Way forward:
Addressing Broader Economic Concerns
: The government should focus on macroeconomic reforms to manage inflation and foster sustainable growth. The Banking Laws Amendment should be complemented by policies that address the root causes of economic challenges, ensuring the banking sector thrives amidst broader financial stability.
Strengthening Cybersecurity and Customer Protection
: Banks should enhance security measures, especially for senior citizens, to safeguard against rising cyber fraud.
Mains question for practice:
Q
The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, introduced several changes aimed at strengthening governance within the banking sector and enhancing customer convenience. Critically analyze the key features of the Bill, its reasons for introduction, and its potential impact on the banking sector.

**********What are the controversies around pardoning power?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Indian and USA Constitution; President;
Why in the News?
U.S. President Joe Biden has issued an unconditional pardon to his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing sentencing for federal tax and gun-related convictions.
What is the history of the pardoning power in the U.S.?
Constitutional Basis:
The U.S. Constitution grants the President the power to grant pardons for federal offenses under Article II, Section 2, which states that the President can “grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment”.
Historical Use:
This power has been exercised by every president since George Washington. Notable historical examples include George Washington’s pardon of participants in the Whiskey Rebellion and Bill Clinton’s pardon of his half-brother Roger on his last day in office.
Controversial Pardons:
The pardoning power has often been mired in controversy, with instances such as Donald Trump pardoning his son-in-law’s father and Joe Biden now pardoning his son Hunter. These actions have raised questions about nepotism and pthe olitical motivations behind such decisions.
What is the current controversy?
Hunter Biden’s Pardon:
President Joe Biden granted an unconditional pardon to his son Hunter for federal tax and gun convictions.
This decision has sparked significant backlash from both Republicans and some Democrats, who view it as an abuse of power and a contradiction to Biden’s earlier statements that he would not intervene in his son’s legal matters.
Political Motivations:
Biden defended his decision by claiming Hunter was unfairly prosecuted due to political motives. Critics argue that this reflects a broader pattern of using presidential pardons for personal or political gain, undermining public trust in the justice system
3
7
What is the Indian system?
Constitutional Provisions:
In India, Articles 72 and 161 empower the President and Governors to grant pardons, commutations, remissions, or reprieves. Unlike in the U.S., these powers are exercised on the advice of the council of ministers.
Nature of Pardon:
A pardon in India absolves an offender from conviction and all associated disqualifications. The Supreme Court has held that this power is subject to judicial review to prevent arbitrary or biased decisions.
Political Controversies:
Similar to the U.S., pardoning decisions in India have been embroiled in political controversies, often reflecting governmental biases or public sentiment at the time.
Way Forward
Need for Reform:
Critics argue that modern uses of pardoning powers often serve political interests rather than justice. There is a call for reform to ensure that these powers are exercised transparently and judiciously.
Establishing Review Mechanisms:
Learning from practices in other democracies, such as the UK’s Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates alleged miscarriages of justice, could help establish a more systematic approach to reviewing pardons and clemency applications
Maintaining Public Trust:
It is crucial for any future exercise of pardoning power to be conducted without perceptions of nepotism or bias.
Mains question for practice:
Q
Discuss the constitutional provisions related to the exercise of pardoning power in the U.S. and India.

An outbreak of
(
Bleeding Eyes
) disease (MVD) has killed and infected many in Rwanda.
Location of Rwanda
About
Overview
• Causes
Marburg Virus Disease (MVD)
, also known as
Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever
• Belongs to the
filovirus family
(same as
Ebola
).
• Discovered during outbreaks in
1967
Frankfurt
, Germany.
Case Fatality Rate
ranges from
24% to 88%
, depending on the strain and treatment effectiveness.
How does it spread?
Animal to Human Transmission
: Spread primarily from
Rousettus bats
, especially
Egyptian fruit bats
found in caves or mines.
Human to Human Transmission
: Spread through direct contact with
blood and bodily fluids
(saliva, vomit, feces, semen, and breast milk). Also transmitted indirectly through contaminated surfaces or clothing.
Symptoms and Treatment
• Early signs include
fever
headache
muscle aches
chills
nausea
vomiting
severe diarrhoea
• Progresses to
bleeding
from various body parts, and death typically occurs 8-9 days after symptoms due to
blood loss and organ failure
No approved vaccine or antiviral treatment
. Supportive care includes
hydration
, symptom management, and
blood transfusions
. Experimental vaccines are being studied.
Why is it a Global Concern?
High Fatality Rate
: MVD’s
case fatality rate
(24%-88%) makes it one of the deadliest diseases.
Spread:
Ongoing outbreaks, primarily in
Africa
, but now affecting
Tanzania
Public Health Threat
: Human-to-human transmission and rapid spread pose significant challenges.
Economic Impact
: Outbreaks disrupt local economies, healthcare systems, and global trade due to
travel restrictions
quarantine measures

**********Windfall Gains Tax on Oil Production, Diesel-Petrol Export Removed
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
With global oil prices stabilizing and domestic fuel supply improving, the government has decided to scrap the
windfall gains tax
, ensuring more predictable taxation for the oil industry.
What is
Windfall Tax?
A windfall tax is a
levy
imposed on
companies experiencing unexpected profits
due to external factors like market shifts or crises.
In India, it was
introduced on July 1, 2022
, targeting domestic crude oil production and exports of diesel, petrol, and ATF.
The tax aimed to capture windfall profits and ensure adequate domestic fuel supply amid rising global prices after
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
The tax was
imposed as Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED)
on crude oil, and
Additional Excise Duty (AED) or Road and Infrastructure Cess (RIC)
on fuel exports.
Initially, the tax was Rs 23,250 per tonne on crude oil, Rs 13 per litre on diesel exports, and Rs 6 per litre on petrol and ATF exports.
regularly reviewed
based on global oil price fluctuations.
Impact of Removing Windfall Tax
Stable Tax Environment
: Boosts predictability, encouraging long-term investments in oil production.
Revenue Decline
: The tax was generating less revenue, falling from Rs 25,000 crore in FY 2022-23 to Rs 6,000 crore in FY 2024-25.
Oil Companies’ Profitability
: Increased profits for producers like ONGC and Reliance Industries as they no longer pay the levy.
Encourages Domestic Production
: Promotes higher domestic oil production and exploration.
Policy Confidence
: Signals that India is confident in stable global oil prices and future supply.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)
Why in the News?
A recent study published in the
‘
Nature’
has shown that
present in approximately 50% of cancer types
, playing a significant role in tumor evolution and genetic heterogeneity.
What is ecDNA?
Details
•
stands for
extrachromosomal DNA
, which is small, circular DNA found in the
nucleus
of cells, separate from regular chromosomes.
• Forms when DNA breaks off from chromosomes, often due to damage or errors in cell division.
• Can carry extra copies of
oncogenes
, which promote cancer growth.
• Initially thought to be unimportant, recent studies show it plays a
major role in cancer
How ecDNA Contributes to Cancer and Drug Resistance
Helps Tumors Grow
: ecDNA contains extra copies of
that help cancer cells grow faster and become more aggressive.
: The extra oncogenes make the cancer harder to treat with standard drugs by producing more harmful proteins.
Faster Tumor Evolution
: ecDNA allows cancer cells to evolve rapidly, making them more resistant to treatments like chemotherapy and enabling the tumor to grow even when drugs are used.
How ecDNA Challenges Genetics Laws?
Mendel’s Law
says that genes on
different chromosomes
are inherited
independently
, meaning they are passed on randomly to the next generation.
breaks this rule by
grouping genes together
and passing them on
as a cluster
during cell division.
This allows cancer cells to
beneficial genes more easily and helps the tumor
Unlike regular chromosomes, which are distributed randomly during cell division,
passed on together
as a package.
This process gives cancer cells an advantage by making sure they
inherit helpful genetic combinations
that support cancer growth and resistance to drugs.
