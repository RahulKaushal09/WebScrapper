CASE FOR A BUFFER FOOD POLICY
Syllabus
Mains – GS 2 & GS 3
Context:
Inflation, based on the official consumer price index (CPI), stood at 8.69 % for cereals in May, and almost twice as much (17.14%) for pulses. These rates would probably have been higher, but for the sales from buffer stocks, especially of wheat and chana (chickpea), built by government agencies during surplus production years.
Background:-
Overall CPI inflation, at 4.75% year-on-year in May, was the lowest in 12 months. It would have been lower had retail food inflation not stayed elevated at 8.69%.
Key takeaways
The Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) open market sale scheme brought down retail inflation in cereals and wheat, from their respective highs of 16.73% and 25.37% in February 2023 to 8.69% and 6.53% in May 2024.
The inherently volatility and unpredictability of food prices, exacerbated by climate change — fewer rainy days and extended dry spells, interspersed with intense precipitation, and also shorter winters and heat waves — has made it difficult for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to consider any monetary easing or cutting interest rates.
The government, too, is forced to resort to undesirable measures such as restricting exports, or imposing produce stock limits on traders and processors.
One possible way out of the conundrum would be to build a buffer stock of all essential food items, by procuring these from farmers during years of surplus production, and offloading the same in times of crop failures to moderate market prices.
There’s scope to not only expand procurement of pulses and oilseeds, but extend it to staple vegetables and even skimmed milk powder (SMP).
The onion, potato and tomato procured can be stored in dehydrated/processed form such as paste, flakes and puree for sales to hotels, restaurants, canteens, and other institutional buyers. This would ensure that both households and bulk buyers do not compete to drive up prices during shortages.
The fiscal cost of maintaining buffer stocks of essential food items may not be that much: the stocked commodities are not meant to be given out free and, instead, offloaded during scarcity/inflationary periods at near-market prices.
Buffer stocking can be an instrument for curbing excessive volatility in food prices, similar to the RBI’s foreign exchange reserves vis-à-vis the currency market. Increasing climate-driven price volatility — ultimately helping neither consumers nor producers — only strengthens the case for a food buffer policy.

INDIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS IN JP MORGAN INDEX FROM JUNE 28
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
Indian Government Bonds (IGBs) are set to be included in the JP Morgan Government Bond Index, Emerging Market (GBI-EM) from June 28. The inclusion will take place over a period of 10 months starting June 28, 2024, through to March 31, 2025.
Inclusion of domestic bonds to global indices will help bring in dollar inflows into India and ensure a stable financing of the current account gap of the country.
What was JP Morgan
s announcement?
In September last year, JP Morgan had announced that it would include IGBs to its emerging markets bond index from June 2024. The decision was taken after the 2023 index governance review, it had said.
India will have a 1% weightage in theJPMorgan Emerging Market (EM) Bond index, which will gradually rise to 10% over a 10-month period, at an inclusion rate of about 1% weight per month.
A higher weightage will prompt global investors to allocate more funds for investment in Indian debt.
How many Indian Government Bonds are eligible for inclusion?
JP Morgan said there are 23 IGBs that meet the index eligibility criteria, with a combined notional value of approximately Rs 27 lakh crore or $330 billion.
Only IGBs designated under the Fully Accessible Route (FAR) are index-eligible. In March 2020, the RBI, in consultation with the government, introduced a separate channel, called the FAR, to enable non-residents to invest in specified Government of India dated securities.
As per the index inclusion criteria, eligible instruments are required to have notional outstanding above $1 billion (equivalent) and at least 2.5 years remaining maturity, JP Morgan said.
What would be the impact of the bond inclusion?
According experts, the move could lead to fresh active flows in the debt market, which remains underpenetrated on external financing.
According to estimates by some economists, India is likely to receive $2 billion to $2.5 billion every month during the 10-month period starting June 28.
Overall, it is expected that $20 billion to $25 billion of flows would come into India due to the inclusion.
It will not only result in lower risk premia, but will also help India to finance its fiscal andcurrent account deficit (CAD), as well as enhance the liquidity and ownership base of government securities (G-secs; debt instruments issued by the central government to meet its fiscal needs).
It could help lower funding costs slightly, and support further development of domestic capital markets, but direct positive effects on India’s credit profile will be marginal in the near term.
While higher inflows will boost the rupee, inflation is likely to come under pressure. When the RBI mops up dollars from the market, it will have to release an equivalent amount in rupees, putting pressure on inflation.
For Your Information:
After JP Morgan Chase & Co, Bloomberg announced inclusion of Indian bonds in the Bloomberg Emerging Market (EM) Local Currency Government Index and related indices from January 31, 2025.

Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act
Prelims & Mains – Polity
: The Gujarat High Court on Thursday granted bail to a juvenile accused of rape and also facing charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act after it held that the Juvenile Justice Board and the children court needed to examine whether he had the mental and physical capacity to understand the consequences of the offences he has been accused of.
According to the case details, the juvenile was in a relationship with a schoolmate, who was also a minor. The girl had died by suicide on the day her elder sister, aged 22 years, found her alone at home with the juvenile. The sister had scolded and beaten up the girl, following which she died by suicide.
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act:
It aims to address offences of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children, which were either not specifically defined or adequately penalised.
It was enacted as a consequence of India’s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1992.
Key features of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act:
It is a gender-neutral legislation as it defines a child as “any person” under the age of 18.
It considers non-reporting a crime so any person in charge of an institution (excluding children) who fails to report the commission of a sexual offense involving a subordinate, faces punishment.
It does not specify any time limit for reporting abuse so a victim may report an offence at any time, even years after the abuse has occurred.
It keeps the victim’s identity confidential as the Act forbids the disclosure of the victim’s identity in any form of media unless authorized by the special courts established by the Act.
Key Provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act:
It defines a child as any person below the age of 18 years. The Act provides punishment as per the gravity of the offence.
It mandates that investigation in the cases is to be completed in two months (from the date of registration of FIR) and trial in six months.
It states a sexual assault is to be considered aggravated if – the abused child is mentally ill or, when the abuse is committed by a member of the armed forces or security forces, a public servant, or a person in a position of trust or authority of the child, like a family member, police officer, teacher, or doctor or a person-management or staff of a hospital, whether Government or private.
It prescribes rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and also a fine as punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault.
It makes provisions for avoiding the re-victimization of the child at the hands of the judicial system. It makes it mandatory to report such cases as it makes it the legal duty of a person aware of the offence to report the sexual abuse. In case he fails to do so, the person can be punished with six months’ imprisonment or a fine.
It prescribes punishment to the people who traffic children for sexual purposes.
It provides for punishment against false complaints or untrue information.
It was amended in 2019 to increase the minimum punishment from seven years to ten years. It further adds that if a person commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below the age of 16 years, he will be punished with imprisonment between 20 years to life, with a fine.

**********50th Year of the Imposition of Emergency in India
Why in News?
A dark chapter in modern Indian history that left a wide-ranging and lasting impact on Indian politics, a state of Emergency declared by the then-PM Indira Gandhi on June 25, 1975, lasted for 21 months.
India entered the fiftieth year of the imposition of the Emergency, which saw the suspension of civil liberties, curtailment of press freedom, mass arrests, the cancellation of elections, and rule by decree.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Emergency Provisions - Now and Then
Impacts of the Declaration of Emergency on India’s Federal Structure
The Political and Social Circumstances in India Leading up to the Emergency
End of Emergency and Afterwards
What Happened During the Emergency?
How did the Emergency Change Indian Politics?
Emergency Provisions - Now and Then:
Under Article 352 of the Constitution of India,
the President may (on the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the PM) issue a proclamation of emergency if the security of India or any part of the country is threatened by -
War or
External aggression or
Armed rebellion.
Article 358
frees the state of all limitations imposed by Article 19 (“Right to freedom”) as soon as an emergency is imposed.
Article 359
empowers the President to suspend the right of people (except under Articles 20 and 21) to move court for the enforcement of their rights during an emergency.
In 1975
, the ground of “
internal disturbance
” (instead of armed rebellion) was available to the government to proclaim an emergency.
This was the only instance of proclamation of emergency due to “internal disturbance”.
The other two occasions in which an emergency was proclaimed earlier (on October 26, 1962, and December 3, 1971), were both on grounds of war.
This ground of “internal disturbance” was removed by
the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act 1978
by the Janata government that came to power after the Emergency.
Impacts of the Declaration of Emergency on India’s Federal Structure:
Converts the federal structure into a unitary one:
Though not suspended, the state governments come under the complete control of the Centre.
Parliament makes laws on subjects in the State List, and extends the Union’s executive powers to the states.
The Union acquires the right to give any direction to state governments.
Term of Lok Sabha:
Parliament may by law extend the (five-year) term of Lok Sabha one year at a time.
Allocation of financial resources:
The President can modify, with parliamentary approval, constitutional provisions on the allocation of financial resources between the Union and states.
The Political and Social Circumstances in India Leading up to the Emergency:
January 1966:
Indira Gandhi elected prime minister.
November 1969:
The Congress splits after Gandhi is expelled for violating party discipline.
1973-75:
Surge in political unrest and demonstrations against the Indira Gandhi-led government.
1971:
Political opponent Raj Narain lodges complaint of electoral fraud against Indira Gandhi.
June 12, 1975:
Allahabad High Court found Gandhi guilty over discrepancies in the electoral campaign.
June 24, 1975:
Supreme Court granted a conditional stay on the Allahabad HC verdict,
declaring Gandhi's election to the Lok Sabha null and void.
The SC also asked Gandhi to stay away from parliamentary proceedings.
June 25, 1975:
Declaration of Emergency by president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed on the advice of Indira Gandhi.
According to the government’s press note,
certain persons were inciting the police and armed forces to not discharge their duties.
June 26, 1975:
Indira Gandhi addresses the nation on All India Radio.
End of Emergency and Afterwards:
January 18, 1977:
Indira Gandhi calls for fresh elections and releases all political prisoners.
The elections of 1977 led to a comprehensive defeat for Indira and
Morarji Desai
became India’s first non-Congress (Janata Party) Prime Minister.
March 23, 1977:
Emergency officially comes to an end.
The Shah Commission
, constituted by the Janata government, found the decision to impose Emergency to be
unilateral and adversely affecting civil liberties.
The Janata government (through the
) reversed many of the constitutional changes effected by the 42nd Amendment Act 1976.
For example,
it made judicial review of a proclamation of emergency possible again, and mandated that every proclamation of emergency be laid before both Houses of Parliament within a month of the proclamation.
Unless it was approved by both Houses by a special majority
(a majority of the total strength of the House and not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting), the proclamation would lapse.
Suspension of civil liberties:
Almost all opposition leaders (including JP) were detained and about 36,000 people were put in jail under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (
MISA
).
Newspapers were subjected to
pre-censorship
In September 1976, Sanjay Gandhi initiated
a mass forced sterilization program
in Delhi.
Legal changes pushed through by Parliament:
With the opposition in jail, Parliament passed
the Constitution (38th Amendment) Act
that barred judicial review of the Emergency.
The Constitution (39th Amendment) Act
said that the election of the Prime Minister could not be challenged in the Supreme Court.
The Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act
made changes to a range of laws,
Taking away the judiciary’s right to hear election petitions,
Widening the authority of the Union to encroach on State subjects,
Made any law passed by Parliament to implement any or all directive principles of state policy immune to judicial review, etc.
Changes pushed through by the Courts:
In the famous case of
ADM Jabalpur vs Shivkant Shukla (1976)
, the SC ruled that detention without trial was legal during an emergency.
Dented the Congress’ reputation:
A party that led the struggle for civil liberties against the colonial state.
First non-Congress government:
The Janata experiment gave India its first non-Congress government, but its collapse also demonstrated the limits of anti-Congressism.
Emergence of young leaders:
The Emergency gave India a crop of young leaders (Lalu Prasad Yadav, George Fernandes, Arun Jaitley, Ram Vilas Paswan, etc) who would dominate politics for decades to come.
Coming together of the social forces:
This resulted in the increase of the representation of OBCs in Parliament.
As a result, the Janata government appointed the
Mandal Commission
to look into OBC quotas, which would go on to make the rise of the OBCs in North India irreversible.
The Emergency has become a part of political vocabulary in India:
Every perceived act of high-handedness by a government being attributed to an “Emergency mindset”.

**********‘Veerangana’ Uda Devi and ‘Maharaja’ Bijli Pasi invoked during oath taking
Why in news?
Earlier, a newly-elected MP from Faizabad, took his oath in the Lok Sabha. During the ceremony, he mentioned Veerangana Uda Devi and Maharaja Bijli Pasi, who are important figures in the Pasi (Dalit) community.
What’s in today’s article?
Parliamentary oath
About
The
third schedule of the Constitution contains the parliamentary oath
Through this, members swear or affirm to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India, uphold India's sovereignty and integrity, and faithfully discharge their duties.
Evolution of oath over the years
The draft Constitution, prepared by the committee chaired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar,
initially did not invoke God in any oaths
, emphasizing a solemn and sincere promise to uphold the Constitution.
During the Constituent Assembly discussions, members like K.T. Shah and Mahavir Tyagi proposed amendments to include God in the President's oath.
They argued that it would provide a divine sanction for believers while allowing non-believers to affirm solemnly.
Despite disagreements, Ambedkar accepted the amendments, recognizing the significance of invoking God for some individuals.
The last modification to the oath came with the
Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act, 1963
This amendment added the commitment to uphold India's sovereignty and integrity, following recommendations from the National Integration Council.
Process
Before taking the oath or affirmation, MPs must submit their election certificate to the Lok Sabha staff.
This requirement was introduced after a 1957 incident where a mentally unsound individual posed as an MP and took the oath.
MPs can then take their oath or affirmation in
English or any of the 22 languages specified in the Constitution
MPs must use the name on their election certificate and adhere to the text of the oath.
Deviations, such as adding suffixes or phrases, are not recorded, and MPs may be asked to retake the oath.
While oaths and affirmations are a personal choice, 87% of MPs swore in the name of God in the last Lok Sabha, with the remaining 13% affirming allegiance to the Constitution.
Some MPs alternate between swearing by God and affirming across different terms.
Invoking different icons during oath taking ceremony in Parliament
During the oath-taking ceremony in Parliament, elected members often invoke or mention various icons, historical figures, or personalities who hold significance to them personally or to their constituency or community.
This can include mentioning leaders, historical figures, social reformers, or cultural icons who have made significant contributions to society or who represent important values and aspirations.
These mentions can highlight the diversity and richness of India's cultural and historical heritage, as well as the personal or political affiliations of the elected members.
Uda Devi, born in Ujirao, Lucknow, was part of the royal guard of Begum Hazrat Mahal of Awadh and took part in the 1857 Mutiny.
She is known for mobilizing people to fight against the British.
On November 16, 1857, she fought bravely near the Gomti River in Lucknow, reportedly killing at least three dozen British soldiers before being killed herself.
Every year on November 16, events are held in central Uttar Pradesh to commemorate her martyrdom.
Uda Devi remains an important icon, especially for the Dalit community.
Bijli Pasi is a well-known figure among the Pasis of central Uttar Pradesh, including districts like Lucknow, Rae Bareli, Barabanki, Bahraich, Sultanpur, and Allahabad.
He is one of the most prominent Pasi leaders, having ruled parts of UP during the medieval period.
The ruins of his fort still stand in Lucknow, where a statue of him has also been erected.
Other notable Pasi figures from this region include Daldev, Baldev, and Kakoran.

History & Culture
**********RBI raises WMA limits of States/UTs
Why in news?
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has increased the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) limits of State governments and Union territories to ₹60,118 crore from ₹47,010 crore.
This decision is based on the suggestions from a group formed by the Reserve Bank, which included some state Finance Secretaries, and after reviewing the states' recent spending data. This increase will come into effect from July 1, 2024.
The RBI further said that Special Drawing Facility (SDF) availed by State Governments/ UTs will continue to be linked to the quantum of their investments in marketable securities, issued by the Government, including Auction Treasury Bills (ATBs).
What’s in today’s article?
SDF is a type of short-term borrowing arrangement provided by RBI to state governments and Union Territories (UTs).
This facility is intended to help them manage temporary mismatches in their cash flows, similar to the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) but with different terms and conditions.
SDF is provided against the collateral of government securities
held by the state governments or Union Territories.
The amount available under SDF is directly linked to the value of these securities.
Auction Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are short-term debt instruments issued by the government to meet its immediate financial needs.
They are sold through a competitive bidding process, also known as an auction, conducted by RBI on behalf of the government.
About
Ways and Means Advances (WMA) are temporary loan facilities provided by the RBI to the central and state governments to help them manage temporary mismatches in their receipts and expenditures.
These borrowings are meant purely to help them to tide over temporary mismatches in cash flows of their receipts and expenditures.
The WMA scheme was introduced on April 1, 1997.
Legal provision
Section 17(5) of the RBI Act, 1934
authorizes the central bank to lend to the Centre and state governments subject to their being repayable “not later than three months from the date of the making of the advance”.
Types
Normal WMA
: A fixed limit is set, and borrowing within this limit is charged at the repo rate.
Special WMA or Special Drawing Facility
: Additional borrowing over and above the normal WMA, backed by the government securities held by the state government.
After the state exhausts the limit of SDF, it gets normal WMA.
Key features
Duration:
The advances are typically short-term, with a duration of up to 90 days.
If the amount is not returned within this period, it would be treated as an overdraft.
The interest rate on overdrafts is 2 percentage points more than the repo rate.
Interest Rates
: Interest rates on WMA are linked to the repo rate.
For Normal WMA: interest rate = repo rate
For Special WMA: interest rate = one percentage points less than repo rate
For overdraft: interest rate = 2 percentage points more than the repo rate
Limits
: The RBI, in consultation with the government, sets limits for WMA for both the central and state governments. These limits are reviewed periodically.
Number of loans
: Number of loans under normal WMA is based on a three-year average of actual revenue and capital expenditure of the state.
Benefits of WMA
Liquidity Management
: Helps the government manage its day-to-day liquidity requirements, ensuring that short-term cash flow mismatches do not disrupt essential spending.
Fiscal Discipline
: Encourages better fiscal management as the governments are expected to repay the advances within a stipulated period, promoting timely receipt and disbursement of funds.
Interest Cost Savings
: The interest rate on WMA is typically lower than market borrowing rates, reducing the interest burden on the government.
Flexible Funding
: Provides a flexible source of funds for immediate and unforeseen expenditures without having to resort to market borrowings, which might be time-consuming and more expensive.
Market Stability:
By avoiding sudden large borrowings from the market, WMA helps in maintaining stability in the government securities market.
Limitations and Risks
Short-Term Solution
: WMA is only a short-term solution and cannot be relied upon for long-term fiscal issues.
Repayment Pressure:
The need to repay within a short period might create additional pressure on the government’s finances.
Interest Costs:
While the interest rate is lower than market borrowings, prolonged use of WMA can still add to the interest burden if not managed properly.

**********Climate change forces Panama islanders to relocate
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Location of Gardi Sugdub
Mains level:
How fast is the global sea level rising?
Why in the news?
In early June, approximately 300 families were relocated from the island of Gardi Sugdub in Panama’s Guna Yala province due to concerns about rising sea levels.
What is happening in Gardi Sugdub?
Location and Community:
Gardi Sugdub, home to about 1,300 members of the Guna community, is an island in Panama’s Guna Yala province.
Sea Level Rise:
The Caribbean region, where Panama is situated, is experiencing sea level rise at an average rate of 3 to 4 millimetres per year. This rate is expected to accelerate to 1 centimetre per year or more by 2100.
Flooding:
Annually, particularly in November and December, seawater floods houses and streets on Gardi Sugdub, despite efforts to fortify the island.
Relocation:
The Panamanian government constructed 300 new houses on the mainland in a development called Nuevo Cartí to relocate affected families.
How are other island nations affected by sea level rise?
Small island developing states (SIDS) are particularly vulnerable due to their low elevation and reliance on marine resources. SIDS in the Caribbean, Pacific, Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and South China Sea face existential threats from rising sea levels.
Examples of Impact:
Islands such as Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Kiribati are experiencing significant land loss and threats to their culture and economies.
Consequences:
Coastal erosion, salinization of freshwater resources, and increased vulnerability to extreme weather events due to rising sea levels, storm surges, and ‘king tides.’
Since 1880, global sea levels have risen by approximately 21–24 centimeters. The rate of increase has accelerated in recent decades.
Causes:
The primary drivers are global warming, thermal expansion of seawater, and the melting of land-based ice such as glaciers and ice sheets.
Due to the Global Temperature Increase:
The global average temperature has increased by at least 1.1 degrees Celsius since 1880, contributing to rising sea levels.
Way forward:
Strengthen Coastal and Environmental Defenses:
Construct seawalls, breakwaters, and other barriers to protect against storm surges and coastal erosion. Restore and preserve natural coastal barriers such as mangroves, coral reefs, and wetlands to enhance natural protection.
Develop and Implement Climate Adaptation Strategies:
Create comprehensive climate adaptation plans that include relocation strategies for vulnerable communities.
Mains PYQ:
Explain the causes and effects of coastal erosion in India. What are the available coastal management techniques for combating the hazard?

**********Why Denmark has taxed cattle burps and farts?    
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why Are Methane Emissions a Problem?
Mains level:
Significance of tax
Why in the news?
Denmark will impose a tax on its livestock farmers for the greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by their cows, sheep, and pigs from 2030.
What is it?
Denmark plans to impose a tax on livestock farmers for greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by their cows, sheep, and pigs starting in 2030.
Tax Rates:
Farmers would initially pay about $43 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent produced by their livestock, increasing to around $108 by 2035.
Actual Cost:
Due to a 60% income tax deduction, the actual cost per ton will start at 120 kroner ($17.3) and rise to 300 kroner ($43) by 2035.
Use of Tax Collection:
The funds collected from the tax between 2030 and 2031 will be returned to the industry to support its green transition. The handling of proceeds will be revisited in 2032. The proposal includes the development of over 600,000 acres of new forest areas.
How Do Cows and Sheep Produce Methane?
Ruminants like cows, sheep, goats, and buffaloes have a specialized digestive system with four stomach compartments, including the rumen. In the rumen, partially digested food ferments, producing methane.
Methane is released primarily through burping and farting as the animals regurgitate and chew cud to complete the digestive process. Ruminant digestive systems are responsible for 27% of all methane emissions from human activity.
Climate Impact:
Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for 30% of warming since preindustrial times, second only to carbon dioxide. Over a 20-year period, methane is 80 times more potent at warming than carbon dioxide.
Ground-Level Ozone:
Methane is the primary contributor to ground-level ozone formation, a highly irritating gas just above the Earth’s surface, contributing to 1 million premature deaths annually.
Rising Levels:
Atmospheric methane levels have dramatically increased in recent years, with the NOAA reporting a record 17 parts per billion increase in 2021, surpassing the previous record set in 2020.
Way forward:
Dietary Adjustments:
Introduce feed additives, such as seaweed or other natural supplements, that can reduce methane emissions during digestion in ruminants. This approach can significantly lower methane production without negatively impacting livestock health or productivity.
Improved Manure Management:
Utilize advanced manure management practices, such as anaerobic digestion, to capture and convert methane emissions from decomposing animal waste into biogas. This not only reduces methane emissions but also provides a renewable energy source.
Mains PYQ:
Describe the major outcomes of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). What are the commitments made by India in this conference?

**********China’s ‘Five Principles’ of Foreign Policy
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Panchsheel policy
Why in the news?
China is set to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, a foreign policy concept initially outlined in a 1954 agreement with India, with special events scheduled for Friday, June 28th.
How It Started?
Historical Context:
India attained independence from British rule in 1947, and the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949 after a civil war victory by the Chinese communists. Nehru aimed to establish good relations with China based on trust and mutual respect, a sentiment reciprocated by China initially.
Origins and Proposal:
The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, known as Panchsheel in India, were proposed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai during bilateral talks with India over Tibet in 1954. This initiative was favored by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Panchsheel Agreement:
The agreement, formally titled “The Agreement on Trade and Intercourse with Tibet Region,” was signed on April 29, 1954. It was intended to enhance trade and cooperation, establishing trade centers and pilgrimage routes while recognizing Tibet as part of China.
Principles:
The five guiding principles laid out in the agreement were mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.
Bandung Conference:
The Five Principles featured prominently in the 1955 Bandung Conference in Indonesia, which included 29 Asian and African countries. The principles were co-opted into a 10-point declaration and later became central to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
Where It Stands Now?
After the India-China War of 1962:
The principles of Panchsheel were severely undermined by the Sino-Indian War in 1962, leading to criticism of Nehru for misjudging Chinese intentions.
China’s Foreign Policy Shift:
Over the past three decades, especially under President Xi Jinping, China has adopted a more aggressive foreign policy. This includes territorial claims in the South China Sea and hostile situations with neighbouring countries.
China’s Relations with the U.S:
China’s relationship with the United States has been marked by hostility, characterized by trade and diplomatic challenges to American dominance globally.
India-China Relations Today:
Since 2020, Indian and Chinese forces have been in a standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, with repeated but unsuccessful attempts to resolve the conflict.
Commemoration of 5 Principles by China:
Despite the current strained relations, China commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Five Principles with a forward-looking theme, emphasizing building a community with a shared future for mankind.
Way forward: (What can India do?)
Engage in Diplomatic Dialogue:
Despite historical tensions, maintaining open lines of diplomatic communication with China is crucial. India can continue efforts to engage in dialogue at multiple levels to manage and resolve bilateral disputes, including the ongoing situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.
Strengthen Regional Alliances:
Enhancing partnerships with other countries in the region and beyond can provide India with strategic leverage. Strengthening alliances through economic cooperation, military partnerships, and cultural exchanges can help counterbalance China’s influence and foster stability in the region.
Focus on Economic and Technological Development:
Investing in economic growth and technological advancement can bolster India’s position on the global stage. Developing robust infrastructure, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and advancing sustainable development goals can strengthen India’s resilience and competitiveness in the face of geopolitical challenges.
Mains PYQ:
China is using its economic relations and positive trade surplus as tools to develop potential military power status in Asia’, In the light of this statement, discuss its impact on India as her neighbor.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
FATF, Mutual Evaluation; Grey and Black Lists
Why in the News?
India has achieved an outstanding outcome in the 2023-24 Mutual Evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
India is placed in the “regular follow-up” category, a distinction shared by only four other G-20 countries.
FATF Evaluation:
The reason behind India’s Achievements
High Level of Compliance
: The FATF stated that India reached a high level of technical compliance with its requirements.
Effective Regimes
: India’s AML (anti-money laundering), CFT (countering the financing of terrorism), and CPF (counter-proliferation financing) regimes achieved good results.
International Cooperation
: Notable achievements include international cooperation, access to basic and beneficial ownership information, use of financial intelligence, and depriving criminals of their assets.
Need Improvement
Non-Financial Sectors
: The FATF noted that improvements are needed to strengthen the supervision and implementation of preventive measures in some non-financial sectors.
Prosecution Delays
: India needs to address delays in concluding ML (money laundering) and TF (terrorist financing) prosecutions.
Non-Profit Sector Risks
: Ensure CFT measures prevent the non-profit sector from being abused for TF, including conducting outreach to NPOs on their TF risks.
Mitigation Efforts taken
Mitigating ML/TF Risks
: FATF recognized India’s efforts in mitigating risks from ML/TF, including corruption, fraud, and organized crime.
Digital Economy Transition
: Effective measures have been implemented to transition from a cash-based to a digital economy, reducing ML/TF risks.
JAM Trinity Implementation
JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) Trinity
, along with stringent cash transaction regulations, has increased financial inclusion and digital transactions, making them more traceable.
About Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
FATF was
established in 1989
through the initiative of the
G7
nations.
Its Secretariat is headquartered at the
OECD headquarters in Paris
, France.
FATF conducts
3 Plenary meetings
during each of its 12-month rotating presidencies.
As of 2019, FATF consists of
37 member jurisdictions
India’s Engagement with FATF
Observer Status
: India became an Observer at FATF in 2006, marking the beginning of its association with the organization.
Full Membership
: On June 25, 2010, India officially became the 34th country to attain full membership in FATF, signifying its active participation and commitment to the organization’s objectives.
Understanding the Mutual Evaluation Process
FATF’s mutual evaluation assesses countries’ frameworks against money laundering and terrorist financing, reviewing compliance with its
40 recommendations
and effectiveness, resulting in a report with
strengths, weaknesses
improvement suggestions.
FATF’s Evaluation of India
Comprehensive Assessment
: FATF’s evaluation of India encompasses various aspects, including the nation’s legal framework, regulatory system, law enforcement efforts, and international collaboration.
Alignment with Global Standards
: Central agencies in India have been actively working to ensure that the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws align with international standards and that their practical implementation is effective.
Back2Basics: FATF Grey and Black List
FATF maintains two primary lists to identify countries with deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) regimes: the Grey List and the Black List.
Grey List (Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring):
It includes countries that have strategic deficiencies in their AML/CTF regimes but have committed to resolving these issues swiftly within agreed timeframes. These jurisdictions are subject to increased monitoring by the FATF. Ex. Turkey, Panama etc. (Pakistan and UAE have exited this list.)
Impact:
Countries on the Grey List are required to work closely with the FATF to address the identified deficiencies.
Being on the Grey List can lead to economic repercussions such as reduced foreign investment and increased scrutiny from financial institutions and regulators globally.
The FATF regularly reviews the progress of these countries and updates the list accordingly.
Black List (High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action):
It includes countries with significant strategic deficiencies in their AML/CTF regimes and have not made sufficient progress in addressing these issues. These jurisdictions are subject to a call for action to protect the international financial system from the risks emanating from these countries.
Countries on the Black List face severe economic and financial consequences. They are subject to enhanced due diligence and, in the most serious cases, counter-measures by FATF member states.
This listing can result in limited access to the international financial system such as IMF, World Bank; reduced foreign investment, and increased difficulty in conducting international business.
Current Black List Countries:
North Korea
Iran
Myanmar (Burma) (added in February 2023)
PYQ:
[2021]
Discuss how emerging technologies and globalisation contribute to money laundering. Elaborate measures to tackle the problem of money laundering both at national and international levels.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
MND and its causes; NIMHANS.
Why in the News?
The annual conference on Motor Neuron Disease (MND) ‘Awareness, Care and Management’ was held at NIMHANS.
What is Motor Neuron Disease (MND)?
MND is a condition that
affects the nerves in the brain and spinal cord
, which are responsible for controlling your muscles.
Over time, these nerves (called
motor neurons
) stop working properly, leading to muscle weakness and wasting away.
Types of MND:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
: The most common type. It affects both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to weakness in various body parts.
Progressive Bulbar Palsy (PBP)
: Affects the nerves in the brainstem, leading to problems with speaking and swallowing.
Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA)
: Affects only the lower motor neurons, causing muscle weakness and wasting.
Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS)
: Affects only the upper motor neurons, causing stiffness and movement difficulties.
Causes of MND:
Genetic Factors
: In some families, MND can be inherited due to specific gene mutations.
Environmental Factors
: Exposure to certain toxins, viruses, or physical injuries might contribute, but this is less clear.
Age and Gender
: It usually affects people between the ages of 50 and 70 and is slightly more common in men.
Symptoms:
Muscle Weakness
: Starts in one part of the body, like an arm or leg, and gradually spreads.
Muscle Cramps and Twitching
: Small, involuntary muscle movements.
Difficulty Speaking and Swallowing
: Due to weakness in the muscles used for these functions.
Breathing Problems
: In advanced stages, muscles that control breathing can be affected.
Emotional Changes
: Some people might experience changes in behavior or thinking.
Diagnosis:
Clinical Examination
: A doctor examines your symptoms and medical history.
Electromyography (EMG)
: Tests the electrical activity of your muscles.
Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)
: Checks how well your nerves send signals.
MRI
: Scans to rule out other conditions.
Genetic Testing
: To check for inherited forms of MND.
Treatment:
There is no cure for MND, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
Medications
