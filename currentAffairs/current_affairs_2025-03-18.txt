**********Mount Fuji
Japan will introduce climbing fees of US$27 on Mount Fuji’s four main trails this summer to address overcrowding and enhance safety for tourists.
About Mount Fuji:
Mount Fuji, also called Fuji-san, is
Japan's tallest mountain
, with a height of 3,776 meters.
It is situated close to the
Pacific coast
in the Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures in the heart of the large island of Honshu, about 100km to the southwest of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area.
It is part of the
Fuji Volcanic Zone
, a volcanic chain that extends northward from the Mariana Islands and the Izu Islands through the Izu Peninsula to northern Honshu.
It is a
stratovolcano
that has been dormant since its last eruption, in 1707, but is still generally classified as active by geologists.
Mount Fuji is one of Japan's
"Three Holy Mountains"
along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku.
The mountain is the major feature of
Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park
(1936), and it is at the centre of a
UNESCO World Heritage
site designated in 2013.
Mount Fuji Origin:
According to tradition, the volcano was formed in 286 BCE by an
earthquake
. The truth is somewhat more complex.
The age of Fuji is
disputed
, but it seems to have formed during the past 2.6 million years on a base dating from up to 65 million years ago; the first eruptions and the first peaks probably occurred sometime after 700,000 years ago.
The earliest precursors to Mount Fuji were
Komitake
(which forms the mountain’s north slope) and
Ashitaka-yama
(which sits southeast of the mountain).
The present-day mountain is a composite of three successive volcanoes: at the bottom is Komitake, which was surmounted by
Ko Fuji (“Old Fuji”)
about 100,000 years ago and, finally, by the most recent,
Shin Fuji (“New Fuji”).

**********River Betwa
River Betwa that once gave life to the Vindhyas, nourished kingdoms, and witnessed the footsteps of sages and warriors alike, lies in silence - gasping, groaning, almost gone.
About River Betwa:
The Betwa River, historically known as
Vetravati
, is significant in central and northern India, serving as a tributary of the Yamuna River.
It originates from Jhiri village in
Raisen district
, Madhya Pradesh, in the Vindhya Range, just north of Hoshangabad (now Narmadapuram).
It flows generally northeast through
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh
and empties into the Yamuna River just east of Hamirpur after a 610-km course.
Nearly half of its course, which is not navigable, runs over the Malwa Plateau before it breaks into the upland of Bundelkhand.
Tributaries:
Jamni and Dhasan rivers
are its major tributaries.
Dams:
The Betwa is dammed at Dukwan and Deogarh for irrigation and water management.
Significance:
The Betwa River has been flowing since
Vedic times
and is mentioned in the
Vedas
through hymns and verses. In the
Mahabharata
, it is revered as
, symbolizing penance, purity, and perseverance.
It is part of the
Ken-Betwa Link Project
, a major interlinking initiative for irrigation and drinking purposes.
The Indian navy named one of its frigates
INS Betwa
in honour of the river.
Ken-Betwa Link Project:
Ken-Betwa Link Project (KBLP)
is a river interlinking initiative aimed at
transferring surplus water
from the
Ken River to the Betwa River
to irrigate the drought-prone Bundelkhand region.
It is the first project under the
National Perspective Plan
for the interlinking of rivers, which was prepared in 1980.
The Ken-Betwa Link Project has two phases.
Phase I
will involve building the Daudhan Dam complex and its subsidiary units such as the Low-Level Tunnel, High-Level Tunnel, Ken-Betwa Link Canal, and powerhouses.
Phase II
will involve three components — Lower Orr Dam, Bina Complex Project, and Kotha Barrage.

**********The Barriers Faced by Construction Workers
Context
construction sector is one of the fastest-growing industries in India,
contributing approximately 9% to the national GDP and projected to reach $1.4 trillion by 2025.
By
2030, the workforce in this sector is estimated to be around 3 crore workers
, however,
concerns regarding labour shortages have been raised,
notably by Larsen and Toubro’s Chairman and Managing Director, N. Subrahmanyan.
While he
attributes this issue to workers' reluctance to relocate due to welfare schemes
, the problem is far more complex.
The structural barriers that hinder the mobility and security of construction workers must be addressed
to ensure a stable and skilled workforce.
Challenges Faced by Construction Workers
Fragmented Employment Landscape
The construction industry in India
heavily depends on migrant labourers
who face significant job insecurity, frequent relocations, and inconsistent access to welfare benefits.
Despite the presence of the
Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) (BOCW) Act, 1996
, which aims to safeguard their rights, many workers struggle to access the benefits it promises.
One major challenge is the
underutilisation of welfare funds
Although State construction boards have collected around ₹70,000 crore through cess contributions,
a large portion remains unused
due to bureaucratic inefficiencies.
Documentation Barriers
A primary obstacle to welfare access is the
requirement of extensive documentation
Construction workers
, many of whom are migrant labourers,
often lack permanent addresses,
making it difficult to obtain identity proofs, birth certificates, and residence documents.
Moreover,
they need an ‘employment certificate’ proving 90 days of work per year,
which is typically issued by employers.
However,
many contractors are either unwilling or unable to provide these certificates
, leaving workers unable to prove their eligibility for welfare benefits.
State-Level Discrepancies and Welfare Gaps
State governments collect a 1-2% construction cess under the BOCW Act
, a 2023 Parliamentary Standing Committee report found that
approximately 75% of the funds remain unused.
reasons include fragmented worker databases
, inconsistent verification protocols, and cumbersome registration processes.
Seasonal employment disruptions
further aggravate these issues.
For example,
during heat waves or air pollution-related construction bans in North India, lakhs of workers lost their livelihoods.
Inter-State Migration
Additionally, inter-State migration poses another major challenge.
Since welfare schemes are not interoperable across States,
a worker registered in Haryana loses access to benefits upon moving to Delhi.
This lack of portability discourages workers from registering for these schemes
altogether, worsening their financial vulnerability.
Proposed Solutions
A Unified National Labour Identification System
A centralised welfare database
similar to the One Nation One Ration Card
scheme could ensure inter-State portability of benefits.
By linking BOCW registrations to UAN (Universal Account Number)
on the e-Shram portal, workers could access their entitlements irrespective of location.
Digital Public Infrastructure for Welfare Disbursement
State governments should adopt
open-source digital platforms
to streamline welfare access and disbursement.
centralised real-time tracking system can minimise bureaucratic delays
and improve transparency. Aadhaar-based authentication could further enhance efficiency.
Simplification of Documentation Requirements
To ease registration,
governments should accept alternative proofs and relax verification norms.
Conducting bulk registrations at construction sites would also facilitate greater coverage
, ensuring that large projects maintain accurate worker records.
Investment in Skill Development
Addressing labour shortages
requires not just an increase in workforce numbers but also a skilled and stable workforce.
Implementing
robust skill development programs tailored to industry needs
will enhance worker productivity and job retention.
skills alone are insufficient, ensuring safe and dignified working conditions is equally vital.
Construction firms must commit to long-term skill-building initiatives and improved workplace standards to create a
more resilient workforce.
Conclusion
India’s construction industry
cannot resolve labour shortages without tackling the systemic barriers
that workers face.
A fragmented employment landscape
, documentation challenges, and lack of inter-State welfare portability
hinder worker stability.
By implementing a unified welfare system
, leveraging digital technology, simplifying documentation, and investing in skill development,
the sector can create a more inclusive and efficient workforce.
Only through these measures can the construction industry continue to grow
while ensuring the well-being of its most vital asset, its workers.

**********A Land Where Ambition Grows Minus an Outbound Ticket
Context
Migration has always been a defining element of human civilization
. It shapes societies, economies, and cultural landscapes across the globe.
The
recent controversy surrounding the deportation of Indian migrants from the United States
sheds light on a
complex and painful reality.
While India celebrates its global achievers,
a large portion of its population continues to seek opportunities elsewhere, legally or otherwise.
Now
it becomes crucial to explore the paradox of Indian migration, the factors driving it, the challenges faced by migrants
, and the need for a national introspection on creating a future where migration is a choice rather than a necessity.
The Indian Diaspora: Success and Struggles
India has the
highest number
of emigrants in the world.
Many Indians have thrived abroad
, with leaders such as Sundar Pichai (CEO of Google) and Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) showcasing India’s intellectual prowess.
These individuals
symbolise a success story that India proudly claims.
However, the Indian migration story is not uniform.
At the other end of the spectrum are thousands of undocumented migrants
, many of whom embark on perilous journeys to the United States,
often via illegal routes through Canada or Mexico.
Unlike the tech entrepreneurs and skilled professionals,
these migrants are not fleeing war or persecution but are seeking economic security and stability
that they believe their home country cannot provide.
Their
plight raises a critical question:
why do so many Indians, despite belonging to a fast-growing economy, feel the need to risk everything for an uncertain future abroad?
The Paradox of India’s Economic Growth and Migration
A painful contradiction lies at the heart of India’s migration crisis. India boasts impressive economic growth, yet
rising youth unemployment and economic disparity drive people away.
While urban centres showcase world-class infrastructure,
many citizens still struggle for dignified work.
States like Gujarat and Punjab
, considered economically prosperous,
have high rates of illegal migration.
desperation of even well-off families, such as the Gujarati family that tragically froze to death at the Canada-U.S. border,
suggests that the
problem is not just economic but also one of aspiration and social mobility.
This
contradiction raises an uncomfortable question
: if India is truly progressing, why do so many of its people feel compelled to leave?
Factors Driving the Migration
Booming Economy, Shrinking Opportunities
At first glance, India’s economy appears to be thriving.
The country boasts a GDP growth rate that outpaces many developed nations,
an increasing middle class, and a rapidly expanding digital economy.
It is home to some of the world’s most valuable startups,
a powerful IT sector, and an increasing presence in global manufacturing.
Yet,
beneath these statistics lies a harsh reality
: economic growth has not translated into widespread, inclusive opportunities.
One of the primary drivers of migration is
Despite India’s strong economic indicators,
job creation has not kept pace with the millions of young Indians entering the workforce each year.
The Middle-Class Exodus: Why Even the Affluent Are Leaving
Traditionally, migration was driven by economic necessity
, with poorer individuals seeking low-skilled jobs abroad to support their families.
in recent years, a surprising trend has emerged, upper-middle-class families and even wealthy individuals are choosing to migrate.
, which are often cited as economic success stories,
see thousands of people leaving every year.
Many middle-class families leave not just for
better wages but for improved healthcare, education, and social security.
Many parents see foreign education as a gateway to better job prospects
and a superior quality of life for their children.
While India’s startup culture is thriving,
the bureaucratic hurdles, inconsistent regulations, and corruption make it difficult for businesses to scale efficiently.
Failure of Inclusive Growth
India’s migration paradox is
ultimately a failure of inclusive growth.
While the country celebrates its economic progress,
wealth and opportunities remain concentrated in specific industries and among certain sections of society.
rapid urbanisation of India has led to development in metropolitan cities, but rural and semi-urban areas continue to lag
in terms of employment generation and infrastructure.
Additionally,
sectors like agriculture, which still employ a large portion of India’s workforce, face declining productivity
and profitability.
Many farmers’ children see no future in agriculture
and look toward migration as a means of escaping economic hardship.
drug crisis in Punjab, for instance, is partly linked to youth disillusionment
due to diminishing opportunities in farming.
The Illusion of the American Dream
long seen as the land of opportunity,
has increasingly become a difficult place for migrants, especially undocumented ones.
Many Indians who reach the U.S. illegally
find themselves
trapped in low-paying jobs, constantly living in fear of deportation.
American Dream, once considered a golden ticket,
often turns into an endless struggle
for survival in a society that does not always welcome outsiders.
recent deportations highlight the harsh reality
While the U.S. has the legal right to deport undocumented individuals,
the manner in which it is done, shackling and handcuffing migrants, raises questions about human dignity.
Other countries, like
Colombia and Mexico, have condemned such treatment of their citizens
, recognising that deportation is an administrative process, not a criminal punishment.
India, too, must take a firm stand against the mistreatment of its people
, ensuring that its citizens are treated with dignity and respect.
The Way Forward: The Need for Change; Creating Opportunities at Home
Job Creation and Economic Reforms
must focus on policies that create meaningful employment
, particularly for the youth.
While the economy grows,
job opportunities have not kept pace with the rising population.
Investments in industries such as manufacturing
, technology, and services
can help absorb the workforce.
Improving Education and Skill Development
Many Indian migrants take low-wage jobs abroad despite having higher education qualifications.
There is a need to align India’s education system with industry demands
and provide vocational training that equips young people with skills relevant to today’s job market.
Strengthening Infrastructure and Entrepreneurship
If India wants to retain its talent,
it must make entrepreneurship and innovation easier.
Many Indians who succeed abroad do so because they find better ecosystems for growth.
Encouraging startups, reducing bureaucratic hurdles
, and providing financial support
can create an environment where young Indians can thrive at home.
Conclusion
true measure of India’s progress should not be its economic growth alone
but its ability to retain its talent and provide opportunities for all its citizens.
Migration should be an option, not a compulsion driven by desperation.
India must transform from being a country that exports talent to one that attracts and nurtures it.
A rising India must be a place where ambition is fulfilled without the need for an outbound ticket,
where success stories are written not just in Silicon Valley but in Indian cities and villages alike.

**********Electoral Reforms in India: Challenges and the Path Forward
Why in the News?
The Election Commission of India has invited political parties to discuss strengthening the election process.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Electoral Reforms (Need, Legal Provisions, Key Issues, Proposed Reforms, etc.)
The Need for Electoral Reforms:
The Election Commission of India (ECI) has initiated discussions with political parties to address concerns related to electoral transparency and voter integrity.
Allegations of
electoral roll manipulation, duplicate voter IDs, and EVM transparency
have sparked fresh debates about the need for comprehensive
electoral reforms
Additionally, issues such as
unregulated election expenditures, criminalization of politics, and violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC)
continue to threaten the integrity of India’s elections.
Strengthening electoral laws is essential to maintaining
free and fair elections
, a fundamental aspect of India's democratic framework.
Legal Provisions Governing Elections in India:
Article 324 of the Constitution
: Grants the ECI power over the conduct of elections to Parliament and State legislatures.
Representation of the People Act, 1950 & 1951
: Governs voter registration and the conduct of elections.
Registration of Electors Rules, 1960
: Regulates the maintenance of electoral rolls.
: Establishes guidelines for political parties and candidates during elections.
Despite these legal safeguards, recent elections have highlighted
systemic flaws
that necessitate urgent reforms.
Key Issues in India’s Electoral System:
Concerns Over Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and VVPATs
Since the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, India has exclusively used Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).
From 2019 onwards, EVMs have been backed by 100% Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT
A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in April 2024, demanding a return to paper ballots and 100% VVPAT-EVM matching, both of which were dismissed by the Supreme Court.
However, the Supreme Court directed that
5% of EVMs in each constituency
should be verified in case of any suspicion of tampering, ensuring transparency.
Allegations of Electoral Roll Manipulation
Recent elections in
Maharashtra and Delhi
raised concerns over
bogus/fake voters
being added to electoral rolls.
Identical EPIC numbers
(Electoral Photo Identity Card) were reportedly assigned to different voters across states, leading to accusations of voter fraud.
ECI clarified
that earlier decentralization of EPIC allotment before moving to the
ERONET database
may have caused duplication, and has pledged corrective measures.
Rising Election Expenditure and Financial Irregularities
The 2024 Lok Sabha elections saw election spending exceed ₹1,00,000 crore, according to the Centre for Media Studies.
While candidates have an expenditure limit, political parties face no cap on spending, leading to extravagant election campaigns.
This excessive spending fuels corruption, as candidates often resort to illicit funding sources.
Criminalization of Politics
As per the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) Report (2024):
251 MPs (46%) in the Lok Sabha have criminal cases.
170 MPs (31%) face serious charges like murder, rape, and kidnapping.
Despite Supreme Court directives for political parties to disclose criminal records three times before elections, enforcement remains weak.
Violations of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC)
Star campaigners
from all major parties have been accused of:
Using
derogatory language
against rivals.
Making
caste and religious appeals
for votes.
Spreading
misinformation
ECI lacks strong enforcement powers
to take strict action against violators.
Proposed Electoral Reforms:
Strengthening EVM and VVPAT Verification
sample size for VVPAT-EVM matching
should be determined scientifically, dividing states into regions.
If even one discrepancy is found, full VVPAT verification should be conducted in the affected region.
Introducing
"
Totaliser" machines, as recommended by the ECI in 2016, would aggregate votes from multiple EVMs, making it harder to manipulate results at the booth level.
Preventing Electoral Roll Manipulation
Linking Aadhaar to EPIC numbers could prevent duplicate registrations, but privacy concerns must be addressed through stakeholder consultations.
The ECI should conduct regular audits of voter lists and rectify anomalies before elections.
Regulating Election Expenditure
A legal cap on political party spending should be introduced.
Political parties should
disclose financial assistance to candidates
, ensuring expenditure remains within permissible limits.
Addressing Criminalization of Politics
Political parties must strictly comply
with Supreme Court orders to
publicize candidates’ criminal backgrounds
The ECI should have the power to
ban repeat offenders
from contesting elections.
Strengthening the Model Code of Conduct (MCC)
The ECI should be empowered to
revoke the "Star Campaigner" status
of leaders who repeatedly violate MCC rules.
Under
Paragraph 16A of the Symbols Order
, the ECI can
suspend or withdraw recognition of a political party
for severe MCC violations.
Strict implementation of
social media regulations
to prevent the spread of fake news and hate speech during elections.
Conclusion:
Electoral reforms are vital to strengthening democracy in India. While the ECI has taken steps to enhance voting transparency and voter integrity, challenges such as criminalization of politics, campaign violations, and excessive spending remain unresolved.
A comprehensive legal and administrative overhaul is necessary to ensure that elections remain free, fair, and transparent. Political parties and the ECI must engage in meaningful discussions to implement these reforms, restoring public trust in India's electoral process.

**********[18th March 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: How climate change affects India’s wheat production
Economics
PYQ Relevance:
Discuss the consequences of climate change on food security in tropical countries.
(UPAC 2023)
Reason:
This question directly addresses the impact of climate change on food security.
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on the
strategy of
consequences of climate change on the food security (2023)
and the
‘Climate Change’ is a global problem
(2017).
Heat waves
lead to health crises, crop losses, water shortages, and increased energy demand. In 2023, severe heat in India caused record-breaking temperatures, affecting wheat production in Punjab and Haryana. For example, The Indian state of Bihar had the highest number of heat wave days in 2023, with a total of 18 days. This was followed by the states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, both having experienced a total of 15 days of heat waves that year.
Today’s editorial highlights the importance of summit diplomacy and the key traits of a strong leader. This topic is useful for
GS Paper 3
in the
UPSC Mains exam.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
This year, India experienced its hottest February in 124 years. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned that March will also be hotter than usual, with more days of extreme heat.
What are the major wheat-producing states in India?
Uttar Pradesh
is the largest wheat producer, contributing approximately 31.77% to India’s total wheat output. In the crop year 2023-24, it produced around 35.34 million tonnes of wheat from an area of 9.53 million hectares.
Example:
Districts like Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, and Agra are significant contributors, utilizing both traditional and modern agricultural practices to achieve high yields.
Madhya Pradesh
ranks second, accounting for about 20.98% of the national production. The state produced approximately 22.58 million tonnes in the same crop year.
The Malwa plateau region, particularly districts like Indore and Ujjain, benefits from black soil and moderate temperatures, which are conducive to wheat cultivation.
Punjab Known
as the “Granary of India,” contributes around 13.87% to India’s wheat output, with a production of about 17.74 million tonnes.
Major districts such as Amritsar and Ludhiana utilize advanced farming techniques and well-developed irrigation systems to maintain high productivity levels.
Why is wheat primarily grown in these regions?
Agro-Climatic Conditions
– These states have a
cool winter and warm summer
, which is ideal for wheat cultivation. The
Rabi season
(sown in November-December, harvested in March-April) aligns perfectly with the climate.
Malwa plateau in Madhya Pradesh
benefits from moderate temperatures that support high wheat yields.
Fertile Soil
– These regions have
alluvial and black soil
, which retain moisture and provide essential nutrients for wheat growth. The soil is well-suited for
irrigated farming
Indo-Gangetic plains of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab
have deep, fertile alluvial soil, which supports extensive wheat cultivation.
Irrigation Facilities
– These states have well-developed
canal and groundwater irrigation systems
, ensuring a stable water supply for wheat crops, which require controlled irrigation.
Punjab’s extensive canal network
, supported by the Bhakra Nangal Dam, ensures year-round irrigation, enabling high wheat productivity.
Why is extreme heat during the wheat harvest season a serious concern for India’s food security and economy?
Reduced Wheat Yield
: Extreme heat accelerates wheat ripening, leading to shorter grain-filling periods and lighter grains. This results in lower overall production, affecting food availability.
In 2022, a sudden heatwave in March reduced India’s wheat output from the projected 111 million tonnes to ~107 million tonnes.
Lower Grain Quality
: High temperatures increase protein content but reduce starch accumulation, making wheat harder and affecting its milling quality.
Farmers in Punjab and Haryana reported lower market prices in 2023 due to poor grain quality caused by excessive heat.
Impact on Food Security
: Wheat is a staple for a significant portion of India’s population. Production shortfalls can lead to food shortages, disproportionately affecting low-income communities. The 2025 heatwave poses a serious threat to wheat and rice production, potentially leading to a 6-10% decline, thereby jeopardizing food security for millions.
Economic Losses for Farmers
: Heat stress forces farmers to spend more on irrigation, fertilizers, and pest control, increasing costs while reducing yields, leading to financial distress.
Farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan faced heavy losses in 2023 due to unexpected temperature spikes during the grain-filling stage.
Disruptions in Procurement & Trade
: Lower production impacts government wheat procurement, affecting stock availability for schemes like the Public Distribution System (PDS) and exports.
India had to ban wheat exports in 2022 to ensure domestic supply, disrupting global markets and trade agreements.
What steps have been taken by the Indian government?
Minimum Support Price (MSP)
– The government announces a
minimum support price
for wheat every year to ensure farmers get a fair price and are encouraged to produce more.
In 2023-24, the MSP for wheat was
₹2,275 per quintal
, benefiting farmers in states like Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.
Subsidized Inputs
– The government provides subsidies on
seeds, fertilizers, and electricity
to make wheat farming more affordable and increase productivity.
Under the
National Food Security Mission (NFSM)
, high-yield variety (HYV) seeds and soil nutrients are distributed to farmers in states like Madhya Pradesh.
Irrigation Development
– Investment in
major irrigation projects
has improved water availability, reducing dependence on erratic rainfall.
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)
has helped expand irrigation in wheat-producing states like Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.
Research & Development (R&D)
Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)
and agricultural universities develop
climate-resilient, high-yield wheat varieties
to enhance productivity.
DBW-187 wheat variety
, developed by ICAR, has helped increase yields in states like Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.
Procurement & Storage Infrastructure
Food Corporation of India (FCI)
and state agencies procure large quantities of wheat to ensure food security and stabilize market prices.
FCI procured over 26 million tonnes of wheat
, mainly from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, ensuring buffer stock availability.
What adaptation and mitigation strategies can policymakers implement to protect wheat crops from rising temperatures? (Way forward)
Development of Heat-Resistant Wheat Varieties:
Traditional wheat varieties are vulnerable to heat stress, reducing yield and quality.
The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has developed
HD 3385
, a climate-resilient wheat variety with better heat tolerance, which is expected to perform well in rising temperatures.
Shifting Sowing Dates and Crop Calendars:
Adjusting the sowing period can help wheat plants escape extreme heat during critical growth phases.
The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has recommended
advancing wheat sowing to mid-October
instead of November to allow crops to mature before peak heat in March-April.
Improved Irrigation and Water Management:
Heat stress increases water loss from soil and plants, requiring efficient irrigation.
“Per Drop More Crop”
scheme under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) promotes micro-irrigation (drip and sprinkler systems) to optimize water use in wheat-growing states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
Promoting Conservation Agriculture Practices:
Practices like zero tillage and residue mulching help retain soil moisture and lower soil temperature.
Zero tillage wheat
in Haryana and Punjab has shown
5-10% higher yields
and reduced water usage compared to conventional plowing methods.
Climate Forecasting and Early Warning Systems:
Advanced weather predictions help farmers plan for extreme heat events.
Gramin Krishi Mausam Seva (GKMS)
provides real-time agro-advisories, warning farmers about heatwaves and recommending protective measures like additional irrigation and mulching.
**********New Delhi’s perilous recalibration with the Taliban
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India-Afghanistan Relations;
Why in the News?
The Prime Minister of India may allow the
Taliban regime
to appoint a new envoy for its embassy in New Delhi.
What are the key reasons behind India’s increasing engagement with the Taliban despite international concerns?
Strategic Influence in Afghanistan:
India aims to maintain a presence in Afghanistan to safeguard its long-term geopolitical interests.Example: India reopened its embassy in Kabul in June 2022, ensuring diplomatic engagement.
Countering Pakistan’s Diminishing Influence:
As Taliban-Pakistan relations sour, India sees an opportunity to reduce Islamabad’s sway over Kabul. Example: The Taliban’s refusal to act against Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has strained ties with Pakistan, creating space for India.
Competing with China’s Expanding Role:
China has accepted a Taliban envoy and is integrating Afghanistan into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Example: China became the first country to accept a Taliban-appointed ambassador in 2023, prompting India to reconsider its approach.
Ensuring Regional Security and Counterterrorism:
A stable Afghanistan is crucial to preventing it from becoming a hub for anti-India terror groups. Example: India seeks Taliban cooperation in curbing ISIS-K and groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) that threaten Indian interests.
Economic and Humanitarian Interests:
Engaging with the Taliban allows India to continue developmental projects and provide humanitarian aid. Example: India has sent multiple consignments of wheat and medical supplies to Afghanistan under humanitarian assistance programs.
Why is the recognition of a Taliban envoy in India considered a significant shift in diplomatic policy?
De Facto Recognition of the Taliban Regime:
Accepting a Taliban-appointed envoy would signal India’s indirect recognition of the regime, despite its lack of international legitimacy. Example: Most countries, including the U.S. and EU members, have refused to recognize the Taliban due to human rights violations.
Departure from India’s Traditional Stand on Terrorism:
India has consistently opposed regimes that support terrorism. Engaging with the Taliban contradicts its long-standing stance. Example: India had previously refused to engage with the Taliban, citing its ties to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).
Contradiction with India’s Human Rights Advocacy:
The Taliban’s treatment of women and minorities has been widely condemned, and recognizing its envoy could weaken India’s credibility as a human rights advocate. Example: The UN has termed the Taliban’s policies as “gender apartheid,” which contradicts India’s global image as a democratic and inclusive nation.
Impact on Relations with Western Allies:
Closer engagement with the Taliban may strain India’s relations with countries that have imposed sanctions on the Taliban. Example: The U.S. and European nations continue to restrict diplomatic ties and financial transactions with Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.
Risk of Setting a Precedent for Other Unrecognized Regimes:
Accepting a Taliban envoy might encourage other unrecognized regimes to seek similar diplomatic treatment, complicating India’s foreign policy. Example: It could open debates on whether India should engage similarly with other disputed governments, such as Myanmar’s military junta.
What are the major risks for India in engaging with the Taliban?
Security Threats and Terrorism:
The Taliban’s ties with terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) pose a direct threat to India’s national security. Example: The
2001 Indian Parliament attack
was linked to JeM, which has operated from Taliban-controlled areas in the past.
Growing Influence of the Islamic State (IS):
The Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-K) has been expanding in Afghanistan, carrying out attacks even against the Taliban and its allies. Example:
IS-K’s attack on the Moscow Crocus City Hall in 2024
and the bombing of a Kabul hotel housing Chinese nationals show Afghanistan’s instability.
Potential Diplomatic Backlash:
Engaging with the Taliban could harm India’s relations with key allies like the U.S. and the EU, which refuse to recognize the Taliban due to human rights violations. Example: The
U.S. and European nations maintain economic sanctions
on Afghanistan, and aligning too closely with the Taliban could attract criticism.
Destabilization of India’s Western Borders:
The Taliban’s alleged support for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has worsened Pakistan’s security situation, and any spillover could affect India. Example:
TTP claimed 147 attacks in Pakistan in February 2024 alone
, and instability in the region could have consequences for India’s border security.
Economic and Infrastructure Investment Risks:
Any investments India makes in Afghanistan may not be secure due to the Taliban’s unstable governance and lack of financial transparency. Example:
India’s $3 billion investments in Afghan infrastructure
Salma Dam and the Afghan Parliament
, remain uncertain under Taliban rule.
Way forward:
Strategic, Conditional Engagement:
India should engage with the Taliban on a case-by-case basis, ensuring its security interests are safeguarded while avoiding full diplomatic recognition. Example: Continuing humanitarian aid and infrastructure projects without legitimizing Taliban rule.
Regional and Multilateral Cooperation:
India should collaborate with regional partners like Iran, Russia, and Central Asian states to ensure stability in Afghanistan while maintaining ties with Western allies. Example: Strengthening mechanisms like the
Moscow Format Talks
UN-led initiatives
to balance engagement and counter-terrorism efforts.
Mains PYQ:
Critically analyse India’s evolving diplomatic, economic and strategic relations with the Central Asian Republics (CARs) highlighting their increasing significance in regional and global geopolitics.
(UPSC IAS/2024)
Reason:
India’s engagement with CARs is influenced by the situation in Afghanistan and the wider regional security scenario involving the Taliban.
**********Why are electoral reforms necessary?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Electoral reform;
Why in the News?
Recently, the
Election Commission (EC)
has invited political parties for discussions on enhancing the electoral process.
What are the key legal provisions governing the electoral process in India?
Article 324 of the Constitution
– Grants the Election Commission (EC) the power of superintendence, direction, and control over elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice President.
Representation of the People Act, 1950
– Governs the preparation of electoral rolls and the allocation of seats in Parliament and State Legislatures.
Representation of the People Act, 1951
– Regulates the actual conduct of elections, including provisions on qualifications, disqualifications, election offenses, and corrupt practices.
Registration of Electors Rules, 1960
– Provides rules for the registration of voters, corrections in electoral rolls, and the issuance of Electoral Photo Identity Cards (EPIC).
Model Code of Conduct (MCC)
– A set of guidelines issued by the EC to regulate political parties and candidates, ensuring free and fair elections, even though it lacks statutory backing.
How has the voting process evolved in India since the first general elections in 1952?
Ballot Box System (1952-1957)
– In the first two general elections (1952, 1957), separate ballot boxes were used for each candidate, where voters dropped blank ballot papers into the box of their chosen candidate.
Printed Ballot Papers (1962 Onwards)
– From the third general election (1962), a single ballot paper was introduced with the names and symbols of all candidates, simplifying the voting process.
Example:
Instead of multiple boxes, voters marked their choice on a single sheet and dropped it in a common ballot box.
Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) (2004 Onwards)
– Since the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, EVMs replaced paper ballots in all constituencies, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) (2019 Onwards)
– From the 2019 general elections, EVMs were backed by 100% VVPAT slips, allowing voters to verify their vote on a printed slip for a few seconds before it was stored in a sealed box.
A voter pressing a button on the EVM saw a printed slip confirming their vote for Candidate X before it was automatically stored.
Remote Voting and Digital Advancements (Proposed)
– The Election Commission is exploring remote voting options for migrant workers and overseas Indians, along with blockchain-based voting mechanisms.
The EC has proposed a multi-constituency remote voting machine (RVM) to allow migrant workers to vote from different locations.
Addressing Electoral Roll Discrepancies:
The ECI aims to improve the accuracy and transparency of electoral rolls, especially amid allegations of tampering in recent elections. For example, opposition parties have raised concerns over duplicate Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers, demanding discussions in Parliament regarding discrepancies in voters’ lists.
Enhancing Gender Representation:
The ECI seeks feedback on measures to encourage greater representation of women in political parties and candidate selection processes. This aligns with international practices and aims to make elections more inclusive.
Regulating Election Expenditure:
Discussions will focus on expenditure ceilings for elections and ensuring timely submission of audited financial reports by political parties. These measures are intended to enhance transparency and accountability in campaign financing.
Improving Voting Accessibility:
The ECI plans to explore alternative voting methods for domestic migrants, absentee voters, and persons with disabilities. This includes feedback on schemes like the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS) to ensure inclusive participation.
Strengthening Legal Frameworks for Campaign Silence Periods:
To regulate election campaigns, the ECI will discuss extending restrictions to print media and online canvassing during the 48-hour silence period before polling ends, addressing concerns about social media misuse.
What is the importance of “One Nation, One Election” in the context of electoral reforms?
Enhanced Governance and Policy Continuity
– Simultaneous elections reduce the frequent imposition of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), allowing governments to focus on long-term policy implementation without periodic electoral disruptions.
If Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections are held together, policymaking won’t be interrupted multiple times due to MCC restrictions.
Cost and Resource Efficiency
– Conducting elections at different times leads to repeated expenditure on logistics, security, and manpower. A unified election cycle reduces financial and administrative burdens.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections cost around ₹60,000 crore; merging state and local elections could significantly cut costs.
Increased Voter Turnout and Engagement
– Holding elections simultaneously can improve voter participation by reducing election fatigue and mobilization efforts.
Countries like Sweden and South Africa conduct national and regional elections together, leading to streamlined voter engagement and participation.
Way forward:
Comprehensive Electoral Reforms
– Strengthen legal provisions for campaign financing, voting accessibility, and electoral roll management, ensuring transparency, inclusivity, and fair representation in elections.
Leveraging Technology for Electoral Integrity
– Implement secure digital voting mechanisms like blockchain-based voting and remote voting for migrant workers while enhancing VVPAT verification to boost voter confidence.
Mains PYQ:
Examine the need for electoral reforms as suggested by various committees with particular reference to “one nation-one election” principle.
(UPSC IAS/2024)
Reason:
This question directly asks about the necessity of electoral reforms which highlights several areas needing reform, such as allegations of manipulation of electoral rolls, issues with duplicate EPIC numbers, concerns about EVM and VVPAT processes, misuse of “Star Campaigner” status, exceeding election expenditure limits, and criminalization of politics.

Recently a White House official has proposed expelling Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance. This comes as Donald Trump pressures Canada, even suggesting it could be transformed into the 51st U.S. state.
About the Five Eyes Alliance (FVEY):
The FVEY is a
global intelligence-sharing network
comprising
5 Anglosphere countries
: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States.
Established in
1946
following the
UKUSA Agreement
between the United States and the United Kingdom, it is one of the most
secretive and influential alliances
in global intelligence and security.
The alliance primarily focuses on
sharing intelligence
, especially
signals intelligence (SIGINT)
, and collaborates on security matters like
counterterrorism
cybersecurity
geopolitical monitoring
It plays a pivotal role in global
surveillance programs
, such as
ECHELON
, and is a key player in shaping
international intelligence policy

Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Economic Impact of Trade Deficit
Why in the News?
India’s goods trade deficit has dropped to a
$14.05 billion
in February 2025, driven by reduced imports of
gold, silver
, and
crude oil
, according to the latest data from the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry
Key Insights from February 2025 Trade Data
Exports
: Goods exports amounted to
$36.9 billion
in February 2025.
Imports
: Merchandise imports fell to a
22-month low
$50.9 billion
, primarily due to lower demand for gold, silver, and crude oil.
Gold and Silver Imports
: The value stood at
$2.7 billion
, the lowest since June 2024.
Crude and Petroleum Imports
: Reduced to
$11.89 billion
, marking the lowest level since July 2023.
On a
year-on-year basis
, exports
dipped by 10.84%
in February 2025, partially due to the
base year effect
of a leap month.
However, imports shrank by
16.3%
compared to February 2024.
Impact of Lower Trade Deficit on India’s Economy
Stronger Currency
: A lower trade deficit reduces demand for foreign currencies, leading to an appreciation of the
Indian Rupee
. This makes imports
cheaper
, benefiting consumers and businesses.
Improved Current Account Balance
positively impacts India’s
balance of payments
, reducing dependence on external borrowing or foreign investments, and contributing to financial stability.
Boost to Domestic Production
: A decrease in imports encourages
local manufacturing
and reduces reliance on foreign products, stimulating economic growth and
creating jobs
Growth in Exports
reduced deficit
reflects a
higher level of exports
, improving India’s
foreign exchange reserves
and supporting
industrial output
Reduced Inflation
: With fewer imports, particularly of essential goods like crude oil and gold,
prices of imported goods stabilize
, helping reduce
inflationary pressures
in the economy.
Better Fiscal Health
leads to less reliance on external financing, helping the government maintain
fiscal stability
and potentially
improve credit ratings
Positive Investor Sentiment
: A smaller trade deficit enhances
investor confidence
, attracting
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)
, boosting economic development.
Focus on Self-Reliance
: Reduced imports drive
self-reliance
, encouraging
domestic production
, and decreasing dependency on imports for essential goods and services.

**********World’s first ‘Supersolid’ created from Light
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
In a groundbreaking achievement, Italian researchers have successfully transformed
light into a supersolid
for the first time in history.
About Supersolid
is a rare state of matter that behaves like both a
and a
liquid
at the same time.
While it maintains a rigid structure, similar to a solid, it can also flow like a liquid without any internal friction.
How was a supersolid created?
Researchers made a supersolid by
combining light and matter
They used
polaritons
(a mix of light and particle pairs called
excitons
) to create this new state of matter.
When these
polaritons reach their lowest energy
, they form the supersolid that behaves like both a solid and a liquid.
Features of a Supersolid:
Dual Nature
: A supersolid is
in structure but can also
like a liquid.
Quantum Coherence
: The particles inside a supersolid work together in a special way because of
quantum mechanics
, creating unique behaviors.
Zero Viscosity
: It moves without any resistance, just like a
superfluid
, meaning it can flow freely even though it’s solid.
Temperature Dependency
: Supersolids only form at
extremely low temperatures
(close to
absolute zero
, or -273.15°C).
Applications of Supersolids
Quantum Computing
: Supersolids could help improve the performance of
quantum computers
, making them more stable.
Superconductors
: They might be used to create materials that allow
zero-resistance
electricity, improving energy transmission.
Frictionless Lubricants
: Supersolids could lead to
frictionless lubricants
, making machinery work more efficiently and last longer.
Fundamental Physics
: Studying supersolids helps us understand
quantum physics
and how particles behave under extreme conditions.
Material Science
: Supersolids could help create new materials for
advanced technology
, including computers, sensors, and energy storage.
