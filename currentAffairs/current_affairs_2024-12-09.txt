COPYRIGHT ACT
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Context:
Recently, Dhanush sent a legal notice to Nayanthara, demanding Rs. 10 crore for allegedly infringing the copyright over a movie.
Background: –
The Copyright Act, 1957 is a comprehensive legal framework in India that governs copyright protection and enforcement. The Act has been amended multiple times, with significant amendments in 1983, 1984, 1992, 1994, 1999, and 2012.
Key provisions of the Copyright Act
Copyright grants exclusive rights to the creator of original works such as literary, artistic, musical, or dramatic works, including films, computer programs, and sound recordings.
The Act provides the owner with economic and moral rights:
Economic Rights: Right to reproduce, distribute, communicate to the public, and adapt the work.
Moral Rights: Right to claim authorship and object to distortion or mutilation of the work.
Duration of Copyright Protection:
Literary, Artistic, Dramatic, and Musical Works: Life of the author + 60 years.
Cinematograph Films, Sound Recordings, and Anonymous Works: 60 years from the year of publication.
The law provides protection to the transformative work which is a creative/ artistic work that takes existing material (text, music, art) and significantly modifies, reinterprets, or builds upon it to create something new and distinct. For example, the comedy group AIB’s 2015 spoof video ‘Every Bollywood Party song’ starring the late actor Irrfan, was a parody of rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh’s ‘Party all night’, and it would not amount to infringement as it can be termed as inspired work.
According to the copyright law, no exclusive intellectual property rights apply to creative works in the public domain. So, the Old Testament and New Testament, or the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible, one of the most widely used translations of the Bible, are not protected by copyright. Similarly, the Ramayana and Mahabharata are not protected by copyright, but the television series Ramayana created by Ramanand Sagar or B R Chopra’s Mahabharata are “transformative works” that are protected.
Copyright infringement: A copyrighted work will be considered “infringed” only if a substantial part is made use of without authorisation.
Section 52 lists acts that don’t constitute infringement, even in cases where one has a copyright over the work. Section 52(1)(a) exempts “a fair dealing with any work” from being termed “infringement” if it’s for private or personal use, like research, criticism or review, or reporting of current events and affairs.

MARBURG VIRUS DISEASE (MVD)
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a warning for the Marburg virus disease.
An outbreak of deadly Marburg virus disease (MVD), often referred to as the ‘bleeding eye virus’, has killed at least 15 people, and infected at least 66 in Rwanda.
Key takeaways
The Marburg virus is a highly infectious pathogen that causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates.
Causative Agents: The Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV) are the causative agents of Marburg virus disease (MVD).
Family: Both viruses belong to the Filoviridae family, which also includes the Ebola virus.
First Detection: The virus was first identified in 1967 in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia, during laboratory work with African green monkeys imported from Uganda.
Transmission:
Natural Host: The natural host of the Marburg virus is the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus).
Animal to Human: Direct contact with bat feces, saliva, or tissues of infected animals.
Human-to-Human Transmission: The virus spreads among humans through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected individuals.
High-Risk Activities: Transmission can occur through close contact with infected individuals, contaminated objects, and during burial ceremonies involving direct contact with the body of the deceased.
Symptoms:
Initial Symptoms: High fever, severe headache, chills, muscle aches, and a rash with flat and raised bumps.
Severe Symptoms: As the disease progresses, symptoms can include liver failure, delirium, shock, bleeding (hemorrhaging), and multi-organ dysfunction.
Fatality Rate: The average case fatality rate is around 50%, but it can vary from 24% to 88% depending on the virus strain and case management.
Diagnosis and Treatment:
Diagnosis: MVD is diagnosed through blood tests such as ELISA or RT-PCR.
Treatment: There is no specific antiviral treatment for MVD. Supportive care, including rehydration therapy and symptomatic management, improves survival.

**********All is Not Well with Soil
Context
The 10th World Soil Day
, celebrated on December 5, 2024, served as
a poignant reminder of the critical role soil health plays in sustaining life on Earth.
Coinciding with this global event,
the Fertiliser Association of India (FAI) hosted its annual seminar on Sustainable Fertiliser and Agriculture,
to discuss the crucial role of fertilisers in nourishing soils and ensuring food security.
This year’s theme, Caring for Soils – Measure, Monitor, and Manage, highlighted the urgency of addressing soil degradation
and nutrient deficiencies that jeopardise agricultural productivity.
The State of Indian Soils
Indian soils are alarmingly deficient in essential nutrients.
Less than 5% of soils have sufficient nitrogen
40% are sufficient in phosphate, 32% in potash, and only 20% in organic carbon
Furthermore,
micronutrient deficiencies—such as sulphur, iron, zinc, and boron—range from moderate to severe.
Despite these challenges,
India remains a global agricultural powerhouse
exporting 85 million tonnes of cereals from 2020-21 to 2022-23
while providing near-free grain to over 813 million people during the pandemic.
success is partially attributed to the efforts of the fertiliser industry, which ensures timely availability of nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), and potash (K),
either through domestic production or imports.
An Analysis of Challenges in Indian Fertiliser Sector
Imbalance in Nutrient Use
One of the most pressing challenges is the
disproportionate use of nitrogen (N) compared to other essential nutrients
like phosphorus (P) and potassium (K).
imbalance is primarily a consequence of India’s fertiliser subsidy policy
, which heavily subsidises urea
making it significantly cheaper than other fertilisers like DAP
(di-ammonium phosphate) and MOP (muriate of potash).
As a result,
farmers tend to overuse urea, prioritising immediate cost savings
over long-term soil health.
misuse of fertilisers has led to skewed nutrient application
ratios in various states.
For example,
Punjab applies 61% more nitrogen than the recommended dose but underuses potash by 89% and phosphate by 8%.
Similarly,
Telangana overuses nitrogen by 54% while applying 82% less potash and 13% less phosphate.
Low Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE)
India’s current fertiliser practices result in low nutrient use efficiency, estimated to be just 35-40%.
This means that
more than half of the fertilisers applied to fields are not absorbed by plants
. Instead, they are
lost to the environment in various forms.
Nitrogen, for instance, escapes into the atmosphere as nitrous oxide
, a potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 273 times greater than carbon dioxide.
This not only exacerbates climate change but also represents a significant economic loss
, as the unutilised fertiliser fails to contribute to crop yields.
Subsidy-Driven Distortions
The fertiliser subsidy system
, while intended to support farmers,
creates several distortions.
Urea, which receives the lion’s share of the subsidy
(about two-thirds), is priced at approximately
$70 per tonne, the lowest globally.
artificially low price incentivises excessive use of urea
, often at the expense of other nutrients.
Moreover,
unlike DAP and MOP,
which were brought under the Nutrient-Based Subsidy (NBS) scheme in 2010,
urea remains outside its ambit.
This exclusion has further widened the price gap between urea and other fertilisers, perpetuating imbalanced nutrient use.
Diversion and Smuggling of Fertilisers
significant portion of subsidised urea
, estimated at 20-25%, is
diverted for non-agricultural purposes or smuggled to neighbouring countries.
Urea’s low cost makes it an attractive input for industries
like plastics and textiles, while its illegal export fetches higher prices in international markets.
diversion deprives Indian farmers of critical resources and increases the financial burden on the government,
which must compensate for the subsidized urea lost to misuse.
Inadequate Focus on Micronutrients
While macronutrients like N, P, and K dominate the discourse
, micronutrients such as
zinc, boron, sulphur, and iron receive insufficient attention.
These elements
, though required in smaller quantities,
are crucial
for plant health and productivity.
lack of focus on micronutrients has led to widespread deficiencies in Indian soils
, further exacerbating the challenges of declining yields and soil degradation.
Broader Implications of these Challenges
The cumulative impact of these issues is far-reaching.
Farmers face declining profitability as imbalanced fertiliser use results in suboptimal crop yields.
Soil health deteriorates over time
, reducing the long-term viability of agricultural land.
On a national scale,
the environmental damage caused by inefficient fertiliser use imposes additional economic and ecological costs.
the inefficiencies in the subsidy system strain government finances, with fertiliser subsidies consuming nearly 4% of the Union budget
in the last fiscal year.
The Need and Key Elements of Policy Reform to Better the Soil Health
Rationalizing Subsidies
The current subsidy policy heavily favours urea, making it significantly cheaper than other fertilisers such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and muriate of potash (MOP).
This has distorted the price signals farmers receive
, leading to overuse of nitrogen and underuse of phosphorus and potassium.
The resulting nutrient imbalance diminishes soil fertility
, reduces crop yields, and harms long-term agricultural sustainability.
Reform is essential to rationalise these subsidies
and encourage balanced fertiliser use.
Economic Sustainability
Fertiliser subsidies constitute a massive financial burden on the government.
In the last fiscal year,
these subsidies amounted to ₹1.88 lakh crore, or nearly 4% of the Union budget.
Such high expenditure diverts resources from other critical sectors
like health and education.
Reforming the subsidy mechanism could alleviate this fiscal strain
while still ensuring affordability for farmers.
Environmental Protection
Current practices result in low nutrient use efficiency (NUE),
with only 35-40% of fertilisers absorbed by crops.
remaining portion contributes to environmental pollution
, releasing greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide and contaminating water bodies through nitrogen runoff.
Policy changes could incentivise the adoption of environmentally friendly practices
and reduce these harmful effects.
Deregulation of Fertiliser Pricing
critical step is to deregulate fertiliser prices
, allowing market forces to determine pricing.
Farmers can be compensated through direct income support
, such as digital coupons or cash transfers, enabling them to purchase fertilisers based on need rather than distorted price signals.
This approach would incentivise the efficient use of nutrients
while promoting innovation and competition within the fertiliser industry.
Expansion of the Nutrient-Based Subsidy (NBS) Scheme
While DAP and MOP are already part of the NBS scheme, urea remains excluded.
Bringing urea under the NBS scheme would help correct the price imbalances
between nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
This move could encourage more balanced nutrient use
and reduce the over-reliance on nitrogen.
Conclusion
Reforming India’s fertiliser sector offers multifaceted benefits. It can enhance agricultural productivity, improve farmers’ profitability
, and reduce environmental damage.
A balanced and efficient use of NPK and micronutrients will rejuvenate Indian soils
, paving the way for sustainable agriculture.
deregulation could elevate the fertiliser industry to global prominence, much like India’s pharmaceutical sector in human health.

**********What is Nova?
Astronomers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) have spotted far ultra violet (FUV) emissions from novae for the first time in the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy.
About Nova:
It is a special class of
transient astronomical event
that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently new star that slowly fades over weeks or months, during their outburst.
Nova occurs
in binary star systems
where a dense, Earth-sized white dwarf star orbits closely with a Sun-like companion.
The white dwarf's strong gravitational pull draws matter from its companion, creating an intense accumulation of material on its surface.
This process triggers powerful thermonuclear reactions, producing a sudden bright burst visible as a nova.
A nova reaches
maximum luminosity within hours
after its outburst and may shine intensely for several days
Significance of the research:
Researchers discovered ultraviolet
emission from 42 novae
, a special class of stellar explosions, and even caught four of them in the act of outburst itself.
This could help scientists study these
interacting binary star systems
in our nearest neighbor galaxy at
different phases of their life
, some piling up matter from their companion, while others spewing it into space.
About Andromeda galaxy:
The Andromeda Galaxy, also
called Messier 31 or M31
, is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way.
5 million light years away
from Earth and is the other major member of the Local Group, our local collection of galaxies.
Like the Milky Way, it is a

in warm, tropical regions
, but they can also be seen in
subtropical zones.
mostly marine,
found in the
Atlantic, India and Pacific oceans
, but can be found in brackish or freshwater habitats.
There are about
250 species
of damselfish in the family Pomacentridae, a group which also includes
clownfish
They come in a range of colors and patterns, from the aptly named four striped damselfish to the vibrant blue damselfish.
Across all species, there are a few things they have in common: their bodies are deeper than they are wide, and they have forked tails. Plus, they don’t get too big—the largest damselfish, the Garibaldi, grows only to about a foot long.
They are lively and quick, and are usually
strongly territorial and aggressive.
Some
feed mainly on plant matter or small animals
suspended in the water; others are omnivorous.
Most damselfishes live along reefs
, but certain species, the anemone fishes, are noted for living among the stinging tentacles of sea anemones.
Some species of damselfish are “
algae farmers
,” meaning they actually nibble away at the habitat to cultivate algae growth. They bite unwanted algae to remove it, allowing other, more desirable algae species to grow. This is part of a balanced coral reef ecosystem
However, some damselfish can eat live coral tissue in their quest to create an
algae garden
. Too many damselfish can stress out an already stressed reef.

**********Syrian rebels seize control of Damascus palaces
Why in news?
Syrian rebels toppled President Bashar al-Assad's 24-year regime in a swift offensive, forcing the 59-year-old leader to flee to Moscow, where he was granted asylum.
The Islamist-led opposition declared the end of the 13-year civil war as Syrians celebrated by exploring and looting Assad's presidential palaces, marking "the end of a dark era."
What’s in today’s article?
Syrian Civil War: A Brief Overview
Fall of Assad government in Syria
Origin
The Syrian Civil War began in March 2011 as part of the Arab Spring uprisings.
Initially, peaceful protests demanding political reforms and greater freedoms erupted against President Bashar al-Assad's authoritarian regime.
The government’s violent crackdown on demonstrators escalated tensions, leading to armed conflict.
Reasons
Authoritarian Rule
: Decades of oppressive governance under the Assad family created widespread resentment.
Economic Hardship
: High unemployment, corruption, and economic inequality fueled public dissatisfaction.
Sectarian Divide
: Syria’s Sunni majority resented the dominance of the Alawite minority, to which Assad belongs.
Arab Spring Influence
: Protests in neighboring countries inspired Syrians to demand change.
Evolution into a Proxy War
Internal Fragmentation
: The conflict fragmented into multiple factions, including the Assad regime, opposition groups, Kurdish forces, and extremist organizations like ISIS.
Regional Involvement
Iran and Hezbollah
: Supported Assad to maintain influence in the region.
Turkey
: Backed rebel groups to counter Kurdish autonomy near its border.
Global Power Rivalry
Russia
: Intervened militarily to support Assad, securing its interests in the Middle East.
USA
: Supported Kurdish-led forces and moderate rebels to counter ISIS and Assad's regime.
Extremism
: The rise of ISIS and other jihadist groups turned the war into a battleground against global terrorism.
Timeline
About the news
Assad, ruling the country since 2000, having inherited the legacy from his father Hafez al-Assad since 1971, was forced to flee the country on December 8.
This was after Islamist rebels led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) marched into the Syrian capital.
Bashar al-Assad’s Rise and Rule
Assad assumed power in 2000 at the age of 35, transitioning from a reluctant leader to a popular figure by 2009, with 68% of Arabs supporting him.
Initially informal and modern in style, he was trained as an ophthalmologist and actively engaged with the public.
A strong personality cult developed around Assad, evident in hoardings, pictures, and posters throughout Syria.
His economic liberalization policies favored modernization but neglected social justice, causing hardships for lower social strata.
The Prelude to Civil War
Public grievances included economic struggles, democratic demands, and fears of growing religious extremism.
Inspired by the 2011 Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, protests emerged in Syria but were harshly suppressed by Assad.
The crackdown escalated into a civil war, with the US backing rebels and Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah supporting Assad.
Accusations of chemical weapon usage further tarnished Assad’s regime.
The Role of HTS and Rebel Movements
Evolution of HTS
Formed in 2012 as Jabhat al-Nusra, initially affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq.
Disavowed ISIS in 2013 and pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda, only to sever ties with Al-Qaeda in 2016, transitioning into Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).
HTS shifted focus to local governance and pragmatism, earning the label of "political jihadists" over "Salafi jihadists."
Shifting Dynamics in 2023-24
Assad’s allies—Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah—were weakened due to external conflicts like the Ukraine war and clashes with Israel.
Turkey provided support to rebel factions, including HTS, capitalizing on the vulnerability of Assad’s regime.
By April 2024, HTS leader Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani expressed renewed ambition, predicting rebel control over key cities such as Aleppo and Damascus.
New Delhi’s Cautious Stance
Experts in New Delhi recall how the Arab Spring experiment in Libya, after the fall of Gaddafi, quickly unravelled into chaos. And how in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood took control.
So, there is caution in the Indian establishment on how it will play out in Syria post-Assad.
Analysis
Daunting Challenges Ahead
The rebel coalition announced plans for a transitional government and free elections.
However, stabilizing Syria remains a monumental task, requiring reconciliation among factions and substantial aid for reconstruction after years of devastation.
Strategic Losses for Russia and Iran
Russia and Iran, Assad’s main allies, suffered significant setbacks.
Russia’s focus on Ukraine and the weakening of Hezbollah due to Israel’s recent strikes diminished their influence.
Humanitarian Implications
The fall offers hope for millions of refugees in neighboring countries to return home.
However, rebuilding the war-torn nation will demand coordinated international efforts and substantial investments to restore infrastructure and stability.

**********RBI's Approach to De-Dollarization and Diversifying Risks
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Key Highlights of RBI Governor’s Address (RBI’s Stand, Geopolitical Context, etc.)
Conclusion
Introduction:
RBI has clarified its stance on de-dollarization, stating that its recent policies are aimed at diversifying risks rather than completely moving away from the dollar.
De-dollarization refers to reducing dependence on the US dollar in international trade and reserves
It is often driven by geopolitical tensions and the desire for economic independence.
This approach balances global economic realities while safeguarding India’s financial stability.
The clarification came days after US President-elect Donald Trump threatened “100 per cent tariffs” against BRICS countries if they sought to reduce reliance on the US dollar in international trade.
Key Highlights:
Diversification over De-Dollarisation:
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasized that measures like local currency trade agreements and Vostro accounts aim to reduce dependency on the US dollar but do not intend to eliminate its role entirely.
Vostro accounts are bank accounts held in India by a foreign bank in Indian rupees
They facilitate trade in local currencies and reduces reliance on third-party currencies like the dollar.
The aim is to mitigate risks stemming from over-reliance on a single currency for trade and reserves.
Central Banks’ Gold Buying Spree:
Central banks globally, including the RBI, are purchasing gold to diversify reserves. In 2022, global central banks acquired a record 1,136 tonnes of gold, followed by 1,037 tonnes in 2023.
RBI added 27 tonnes of gold in October 2024 alone, the largest among central banks during that period.
The shift to gold is driven by uncertainties, such as the
Ukraine war
and the fear of secondary sanctions, especially in countries like
Russia
China
Impact of Dollar Dominance:
The dollar's share in global foreign reserves has seen a gradual decline, partially offset by the
rise of the Chinese yuan
Emerging markets like India are seeking alternatives to dollar reliance due to the geopolitical and economic risks associated with the currency’s dominance.
Domestic Currency Trade:
India is encouraging trade in domestic currencies with partners like Russia and the UAE to partially de-risk its trade ties.
However, international trade in rupees has been limited due to India's trade deficits with most countries except the US.
Geopolitical Context:
BRICS and Currency Discussions:
BRICS nations have deliberated on creating a shared currency but face challenges due to their geographical and economic diversity.
India has resisted using the Chinese yuan for Russian oil imports despite its growing acceptance globally, citing economic sovereignty concerns.
Challenges in India's Neighbourhood:
Surging oil prices and declining dollar reserves have caused social and political unrest in South Asian countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.
While India has maintained robust reserves, it remains vigilant about the dollar’s volatility.
Conclusion:
India’s cautious approach to managing dollar reliance reflects a strategic balance between mitigating risks and maintaining global trade stability.
Through increased gold reserves and efforts to promote the rupee in international trade, the RBI is navigating a complex economic landscape while safeguarding national interests.
However, challenges like trade deficits and high transaction costs in domestic currency trade remain barriers to reducing dollar dependence entirely.

**********The Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, 2024
Why in News?
The Rajya Sabha has passed the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, 2024, with the aim of boosting domestic production of petroleum and other mineral oils while encouraging private investment.
This amendment seeks to address gaps in the current law [
the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948
], streamline regulations, and reduce India's dependence on imports.
However,
the Bill
(introduced by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas)
has sparked criticism
over its potential impact on state rights and environmental concerns.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Key Features of the Oilfields Bill
Objectives and Potential Impacts of the Oilfields Bill
Criticisms and Concerns Regarding the Oilfields Bill
Conclusion
Key Features of the Oilfields Bill:
Clarification of mineral oil definition:
The Bill defines "mineral oils"
to include hydrocarbons in various forms
, such as crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum.
It excludes resources like coal, lignite, and helium
associated with petroleum or coal, as these fall under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.
Shift from mining to petroleum leases:
Replaces references to “mining leases” with “petroleum leases,”
which are newly defined to include activities such as exploration, production, and disposal of mineral oils.
The Centre’s power to regulate petroleum leases supersedes earlier provisions for mining leases.
Encouragement of private investment:
Introduces measures to
attract private players to boost domestic petroleum production
Maintains existing lease terms, ensuring no disadvantage to lessees during the lease period.
Removes criminal penalties
for violations of the Act, replacing them with significant fines (up to ₹25 lakh) and additional daily penalties for persistent violations.
Adjudication of penalties:
The central government will appoint
an officer of the rank of Joint Secretary or above for adjudication of penalties.
Appeals against the decisions
of the Adjudicating Authority will lie before the Appellate Tribunal specified in the Petroleum and Natural Gas Board Regulatory Board Act, 2006.
The 2006 Act designates the
Appellate Tribunal for Electricity,
constituted under the Electricity Act, 2003, as the Appellate Tribunal.
Objectives and Potential Impacts of the Oilfields Bill:
Boosting domestic production:
Encourages private investment to reduce reliance on petroleum imports.
Modernises regulations to reflect industry needs and technological advancements.
Strengthening environmental oversight:
Expands the Centre’s authority to frame rules promoting renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions at oilfields.
Criticisms and Concerns Regarding the Oilfields Bill:
Impact on state rights:
Opposition parties argue that replacing “mining” with “petroleum” leases diminishes state powers
to tax and regulate activities.
The Supreme Court
recently upheld states' rights to tax mining activities under the
State List
(of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution)
but the Bill’s focus on petroleum leases may shift regulatory power to the
Union List
Privatisation and environmental risks:
Critics caution against granting significant discretion to private players. They advocate
prioritising public-sector companies like ONGC
Concerns over the potential environmental impact of privatised operations and reduced criminal liability have been raised.
Demand for further review:
Opposition parties suggest sending the Bill to a select committee for a more detailed evaluation.
Conclusion:
The Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, 2024, aims to modernise India’s regulatory framework for petroleum production and attract private investment.
While it offers several benefits, concerns about its implications for state rights, environmental safeguards, and public sector priorities call for
a balanced approach and further scrutiny.

**********The issue of India’s economic growth versus emissions
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Sustainable Development; Green Economy;
Why in the News?
The Economic Survey (2023-24) claims that India has managed to grow its economy without significantly increasing its greenhouse gas emissions. This claim has sparked the debate about actual sustainable growth in India.
What does the Economic Survey (2023-24) say about GHG emissions?
Relative Decoupling Achieved:
Between 2005 and 2019, India’s GDP grew at a 7% CAGR, while GHG emissions increased by 4%.
Emission Intensity Reduction:
India reduced emission intensity by 33% from 2005 levels, achieving its 2030 NDC target 11 years early.
Carbon Sink Expansion:
India aims to add a 2.5–3 billion tonne carbon sink by 2030, building on the 1.97 billion tonnes achieved (2005–2019).
Investment Needs:
Achieving NDC targets requires $2.5 trillion by 2030, with a focus on domestic resources, affordable finance, and technology access.
Has India decoupled its economic growth from GHG emissions?
Arguments against decoupling:
The Economic Survey does not clarify whether the observed decoupling is
absolute
(declining emissions with GDP growth) or
relative
(emissions rising slower than GDP).
India has achieved
economy-wide relative decoupling
since 1990, with GDP growing six-fold while GHG emissions have only tripled. However,
absolute decoupling
has not been achieved, as emissions continue to rise.
Agriculture and manufacturing
, major contributors to India’s GHG emissions, require detailed sectoral analysis.
Argument in favour of decoupling:
The Economic Survey indicates that between 2005 and 2019, India’s GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7%, while GHG emissions grew at a CAGR of only 4%.
India has successfully reduced its emission intensity by 33% from 2005 levels, achieving its initial Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target for 2030 eleven years ahead of schedule. This reduction indicates that India is managing to grow economically while lowering the emissions per unit of GDP.

**********The row over tungsten mining near Madurai
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Mines and Mineral; Challenges faced by states;
Why in the News?
Environmental activists protested outside the Madurai District Collector’s office (Tamil Nadu), voicing their opposition to Vedanta’s auction win for Tungsten Mining Rights in Melur, following the
Ministry of Mines
‘ announcement
Why have there been protests over mining Rights?
Environmental Concerns:
Activists and residents are vehemently opposing the tungsten mining project due to its potential impact on biodiversity. Because of the fears that mining activities could irreparably damage these sites and disrupt local ecosystems, including vital water sources like the Periyar canal.
Community Impact:
Locals fear that mining will threaten their livelihoods, as many depend on agriculture and local resources. The protests have seen significant participation from various villages in the region, highlighting widespread community opposition to the project.
Political Response:
The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu has called for the cancellation of the mining rights and plans to introduce a resolution in the Tamil Nadu Assembly to formally reject the mining project. He emphasizes that any mining activity in these areas would be unacceptable without state consent.
What does the Ministry of Mines say about Mining?
Auction of Mineral Blocks:
The Nayakkarpatti Tungsten Block covering an area of over 20.16 sq. km. was proposed for auction in February 2024. Inputs were taken from the state government of Tamil Nadu before the block was put up for auction.
The Ministry cited the
Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act
1957
as the legal framework enabling this auction process.
Mineral Richness:
The Ministry also noted that the area designated for tungsten mining was found to be rich in
scheelite (
a crucial ore for tungsten extraction), thus justifying its selection for mining activities.
About the  Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act of 1957:
The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, provides a framework for the regulation of mining activities in India, governing the exploration, licensing, and development of minerals except for petroleum and natural gas.
It empowers the
central government to specify major minerals
and the
state governments to regulate minor minerals,
ensuring a structured division of responsibilities in mineral resource management.
Major minerals
high-value minerals
that include coal, lignite, iron ore, bauxite, gold, silver, zinc, copper, manganese, and other ores critical for industrial and strategic purposes.
Minor minerals
low-value,
non-metallic minerals primarily used in construction and local industries, such as sand, gravel, clay, building stones, marble, and slate.
Is there a Centre-State rift?
Yes, a notable rift exists between the Tamil Nadu government and the Union government regarding this issue.
Lack of State Consent:
The Tamil Nadu government claims it did not provide consent for the auction and had previously communicated concerns regarding environmental implications. In contrast, the Union government contends that there was no formal opposition from Tamil Nadu during the auction process.
Political Tensions:
This situation has led to heightened tensions between the state and central governments, with accusations from Tamil Nadu officials that their concerns were ignored by the Union government when granting mining rights to Hindustan Zinc Limited.
Can the state government supersede the authority of the central government in this matter?
In the context of mining rights and environmental matters, the
state government cannot directly override the power of the central government
. However, there are several ways available to the state government to influence or challenge the decision made by the Union government.
Constitutional Framework
: The Indian Constitution divides powers between the Union and states; mining regulation is under the
Union List
, while environmental protection is in the
Concurrent List
, granting states authority over local environmental issues.
Biodiversity & Environmental Protection
: States can challenge mining projects through laws like the
Environmental Protection Act (1986)
Biological Diversity Act (2002)
, or by passing laws to protect ecologically sensitive areas.
State Assembly’s Role
: The state legislature can pass resolutions expressing opposition to federal actions, and applying political pressure on the Union government, especially with public protests.
Judicial Review & Coordination
: States can seek judicial review if Union actions violate constitutional or environmental laws. While states cannot override central mining rights, cooperative federalism emphasizes consultation between the Union and states.
Way forward:
Enhanced State-Central Coordination:
Establish a more transparent and binding consultation process between the state and central governments before granting mining rights, ensuring that local concerns and state consent are prioritized, especially for ecologically sensitive areas.
Thorough Environmental Review:
Implement a mandatory, independent Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for mining projects in biodiversity hotspots, incorporating input from local communities, environmental experts, and authorities to address potential ecological and socio-economic impacts.
Mains PYQ:
Coastal sand mining, whether legal or illegal, poses one of the biggest threats to our environment. Analyse the impact of sand mining along the Indian coasts, citing specific examples.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Emissions Gap Report 2024; Important Highlights
Mains level:
Climate change; Pollution; Global Climate Goals;
Why in the News?
According to the recently released ‘
Emission Gap Report 2024’
presented by
UNEP,
Global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions have reached a new high of 57.1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2023, a
1.3% rise compared to 2022.
What are the key points of Emissions Gap Report 2024?
Urgent Emission Reduction Targets:
To align with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement, global greenhouse gas emissions must decrease by 42% by 2030 and 57% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels.
For a 2°C target, reductions of 28% by 2030 and 37% by 2035 are necessary. Current commitments and policies are insufficient, putting the world on track for a temperature rise of 2.6-3.1°C, which would lead to severe climate impacts.
Potential for Significant Reductions:
The report highlights that it is still technically feasible to achieve the 1.5°C pathway through aggressive action, including increased deployment of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which could contribute 27% of the necessary reductions by 2030 and 38% by 2035.
Additionally, actions related to forests could provide around 20% of the potential reductions in both years. A comprehensive approach involving government action, investment in mitigation strategies, and international cooperation is essential to realize these opportunities.
What are the Global Emission trends?
Global greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions have continued to rise, reaching a
record high
of 57.1 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2023. This marks an increase from previous years, with fossil fuel CO₂ emissions projected at 37.4 billion tonnes, up 0.8% from 2023, and total CO₂ emissions—including land-use changes—projected to be 41.6 billion tonnes in 2024.
The increase is attributed primarily to rising emissions from major economies such as
China and India,
with India experiencing the largest relative increase at 6.1% and China contributing the most in absolute terms.
The overall trend indicates that despite some positive developments in
renewable energy adoption
, there is no sign that global fossil fuel emissions have peaked, necessitating immediate and substantial reductions to meet climate targets.
What is the progress of G20 countries towards NDCs?
Mixed Progress on NDCs:
Among G20 countries, six members (China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, and Turkey) are projected to meet their unconditional Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets with current policies.
However, eight members (Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EU, South Korea, South Africa, and the United States) require further action to achieve their targets.
This indicates a significant disparity in progress across different G20 nations, with many needing to be on track to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement.
Need for Enhanced Ambition:
The G20 must significantly ramp up its climate ambitions in the next round of NDCs to align with the goals of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This includes committing to substantial emissions reductions—42% by 2030 and 57% by 2035.
What is the NCD target?
Collective Emission Reduction Goals:
G20 countries have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), targeting a 42% reduction by 2030 and 57% by 2035, aligned with the Paris Agreement to limit warming below 2°C.
Diverse Member Targets and Progress:
G20 members have varied NDC targets, such as China aiming to peak CO2 emissions by 2030 with a 60-65% reduction in carbon intensity, while Argentina caps net emissions at 483 million tons of CO2 equivalent.
What is needed to bridge the gap between 2030 and 2035 goals? (Way forward)
Significant Annual Emission Reductions:
A reduction of 7.5% per year until 2035 is necessary to align with the 1.5°C pathway, while a 4% annual reduction is needed for the 2°C target.
Investment in Renewable Energy:
The increased deployment of solar and wind technologies could deliver approximately 27% of the total emission reduction potential by 2030 and 38% by 2035.
Action on Forests:
Protecting and restoring forests could provide around 20% of the required reductions in both years.
Comprehensive Policy Measures:
A whole-of-government approach is essential, maximizing socioeconomic and environmental co-benefits while minimizing trade-offs.
Increased Mitigation Investment:
A minimum six-fold increase in investments for climate mitigation is critical, necessitating reforms in global financial systems and strong private sector involvement.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss global warming and mention its effects on the global climate. Explain the control measures to bring down the level of greenhouse gases that cause global warming, in the light of the Kyoto Protocol, 1997.
