**********Who are Pashtuns?
The Pakistan government recently banned the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), a group which fights for the rights of ethnic Pashtuns, citing it as a threat to national security.
About Pashtuns:
Pashtuns—also known as “Pathans” and “Pakhtuns”—are an ethnic group of people found throughout Afghanistan and Pakistan.
They reside primarily in the region that lies between the Hindu Kush in northeastern Afghanistan and the northern stretch of the Indus River in Pakistan.
The Pashtuns in Pakistan were separated from those in Afghanistan by the ‘Durand Line’, which divided the region between British India and Afghanistan in the late 19th century.
The Pashtun constitute the largest ethnic group of the population of Afghanistan (40-50 percent of the population) and bore the exclusive name of Afghan before that name came to denote any native of the present land area of Afghanistan.
The Pashtun are united primarily by a common language, Pashto (an official language of Afghanistan).
They are generally able to speak Farsi (Persian), when necessary, often relying on the language in the context of trade dealings in the region.
Other commonalities include Sunni Islam and a common social code (Pashtunwali) that governs both ethical behaviour and custom.
Kinship is the basis of Pashtun society.
Each tribe, consisting of kinsmen who trace descent in the male bloodline from a common tribal ancestor, is divided into clans, subclans, and patriarchal families.
Occupation:
Most Pashtun are sedentary farmers, combining cultivation with animal husbandry. Some are migratory herders and caravaners.
Many Pashtuns serve in the military. Smaller numbers hold political posts.

**********What is Fattah-2?
Iran recently fired more than 180 ballistic missiles, including its hypersonic medium-range Fattah-2, in a major offensive aimed at overwhelming Israel’s air defences.
About Fattah-2:
Fattah, which means conqueror in Farsi, is a hypersonic ballistic missile.
It was developed by Iran. It is a new version of its first domestically made hypersonic ballistic missile named ‘Fattah’.
Features:
It is equipped with a Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV) warhead that can manoeuvre and glide at hypersonic speed.
It uses a liquid-fuel rocket propellant. The liquid fuel engine can adjust the thrust force.
The precision-guided two-stage missile can hit targets within a range of 1500 kilometres with a velocity of Mach 15 (fifteen times the speed of sound, i.e 18522 km/hr).
Measuring 12 meters in length, it can carry 200 kilograms of explosives.
It is capable of significant trajectory changes during flight to evade defence systems.
While the missile can accelerate outside the Earth's atmosphere, its aerodynamic control surfaces allow for steering within the atmosphere.

**********Key Facts about English Channel
Several people, including a child, died trying to cross the English Channel from France to England, the French Interior Minister said recently.
About English Channel:
It is a narrow arm of the Atlantic Ocean.
It separates the southern coast of England (part of Great Britain) from the northern coast of France.
The channel and the North Sea are connected by the Strait of Dover in the east.
The current name, “English Channel,” dates back to the 18th century. Before then, the English mostly referred to the waterway as a “Narrow Sea.”
The French refer to the Channel as “la Manche” because of its sleevelike shape.
With an area of some 29,000 square miles (75,000 square km), it is the smallest of the shallow seas covering the continental shelf of Europe.
It is 350 miles (560 kilometers) long. At its widest point, it is 150 miles (240 kilometers) across. At its narrowest, it is only 21 miles (34 kilometers) across.
It is a shallow waterway with an average depth of 63 m.
Climate: Temperate maritime climate, with warm summers and cold winters.
The main islands are the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands (a collection of islands including Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, and Sark).
It is one of the world’s busiest shipping areas, linking southern England, the United Kingdom to northern France.
It accounts for up to 20% of the global maritime trade and connects the Atlantic Ocean to the North Sea.

**********What is Progeria?
Sammy Basso, who was the longest-living survivor of the rare genetic disease progeria, recently died at the age of 28.
About Progeria:
Progeria, also known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, is an extremely rare, progressive genetic disorder.
It causes children to age rapidly.
A tiny genetic mutation causes the disease.
It is reported to occur in 1 in 4 million newborns worldwide.
Newborns with the disorder appear to be healthy at birth but usually start to show signs of premature aging during their first one to two years of life.
Their growth rate slows, and they don’t gain weight as expected.
Progeria doesn't affect a child's intelligence or brain development.
However, their rapid aging causes distinct physical characteristics, including:
Hair loss (baldness).
Prominent eyes.
Aged, wrinkled skin.
A thin, beaked nose.
Disproportionately small face compared to head size.
Loss of fat under the skin.
As children with progeria get older, they get diseases you'd expect to see in people age 50 and older, including bone loss, hardening of the arteries, and heart disease.
The condition is always fatal. Heart problems or strokes are the eventual cause of death in most children with progeria.
The average life expectancy for a child with progeria is about 15 years. Some with the condition may die younger, and others may live longer, even to about 20 years.
There's no cure for progeria. A drug called lonafarnib has been shown to slow down the progression of the disease.

**********Respiratory Synctial Virus Infection
Recently, the World Health Organization recommended vaccinating pregnant women and administering infants with an antibody to prevent severe Respiratory Synctial Virus (RSV) infection in newborns.
About Respiratory Synctial Virus Infection:
RSV, which typically causes cold-like symptoms, is a leading cause of severe infection and death in babies and older adults.
Symptoms: They include a runny nose, a decrease in appetite and cough etc.
Transmission: RSV spreads from person to person through
The air by coughing and sneezing;
Direct contact, such as kissing the face of a child who has RSV;
Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands;
Premature infants, babies younger than 6 months old, people above age 65 and people who have a compromised immune system, chronic lung disease or congenital heart condition can get a more severe case of RSV.
People who have an RSV infection are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days. But sometimes infants and people with weakened immune systems can continue to spread the virus for as long as 4 weeks.
A severe infection leads to pneumonia and bronchiolitis.

**********What are Eco-Sensitive Zones?
Many leaders of both the ruling BJP and opposition parties in Gujarat have protested against the proposed Eco-Sensitive Zones around Gir forest.
About Eco-Sensitive Zones:
As per the National Wildlife Action Plan (2002-2016), issued by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, land within 10 km of the boundaries of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries is to be notified as eco-fragile zones or Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZ).
While the 10-km rule is implemented as a general principle, the extent of its application can vary.
Areas beyond 10 km can also be notified by the Union government as ESZs if they hold larger ecologically important “sensitive corridors”.
It acts as a buffer zone around Protected Areas — national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, tiger reserves, etc. — so that the wildlife has a transition zone around them.
Significance of ESZ
Eco-Sensitive Zones are created as “shock absorbers” for the protected areas, to minimize the negative impact on the “fragile ecosystems” by certain human activities taking place nearby.
These areas are meant to act as a transition zone from areas requiring higher protection to those requiring lesser protection.
Permitted activities in ESZ: Ongoing agricultural or horticultural practices, rainwater harvesting, organic farming, among others.
No commercial mining, stone quarrying, large hydroelectric projects, polluting industries, brick kilns, etc. are allowed in ESZ.
Commercial establishment of hotels, resorts, small-scale non-polluting industries and the construction of civic amenities are regulated.
What makes Gir unique?
Gir protected areas include the Gir National Park, the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, the Paniya Wildlife Sanctuary and the Mitiyala Wildlife Sanctuary, spread across the Junagadh, Amreli and Gir Somnath districts in Gujarat’s Saurashtra region in its south.

**********How Major Powers are Seeing the Conflicts in the West Asian Region?
Why in News?
The terrorist attacks by Hamas (on October 7, 2023) on Israel has sparked the West Asia crisis. On the anniversary of the October 7 attacks, the article tries to analyse the current scenario from the perspective of Israel, West, the Arab states in the region, and New Delhi.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What Israel is Doing?
What is the Position of the Arab States on West Asian Conflicts?
What is the Approach of the West, Russia and China Towards West Asian Conflicts?
What is the View of New Delhi on West Asian Conflicts?
Attacks on Gaza:
Since the October 7 attacks, operations by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have caused a heavy death toll in Gaza.
While the international opinion in favour of
Palestinian statehood
has strengthened over the past year, Israeli political opinion
rejecting Palestinian sovereignty
has strengthened at the same time.
For the time being, the initial criticism of Israel's security apparatus's October 7, 2023, failure has faded away.
Attacking Iran-backed “axis of resistance” groups:
Israel has made an effort to maintain its military edge against the Iran-backed -
Hezbollah
(Lebanon-based) and the
Houthis
(Yemen-based) - by carrying out strikes in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.
Both (Hezbollah and Houthis) were carrying out rocket and missile attacks on Israel since late last year.
The Houthi attacks disrupted international shipping in the Red Sea, and imposed economic costs on countries far beyond the theatre of the conflict.
Ignoring calls for peace:
Israel has ignored a call for ceasefire by the UNSC and US advice of restraint.
Retaliating Iran:
Israel also retaliated after Iran launched an unprecedented cruise missile and drone barrage against it (in April), and has vowed to make the regime in Tehran pay for a second wave of aerial attacks on October 1.
Remained committed to the goal of geo-economic reset:
Major Arab powers such as Saudi Arabia and UAE have r
emained committed to the process of a geopolitical and geo-economics reset
in the Middle East that was underway before October 2023.
But the
war has brought the issue of Palestinian sovereignty front and centre
, with all the regional powers beginning to see it as a necessary condition for long-term peace.
Maintaining relations with both Israel and Iran:
Rather than giving up on attempts to restore relations with Israel, these countries seem to be
trying to use it as leverage to resolve the Palestine issue
This can be drawn from the sustenance of the
2020 Abraham Accords
despite the highest death toll in Gaza in decades.
According to the Abraham Accords, the regional stability needed for economic development
requires peace with not just Israel, but also Iran
As a result, Saudi Arabia stayed out of the US- and UK-led naval coalition to strike at the Yemeni (Houthis) group.
West:
Pro-Israel:
Led by the US (which successfully mediated between Iran and Israel in April), the western countries have warned all actors against further escalation, and committed to humanitarian aid for Gaza.
However, they stand by Israel, in case it breaches any red line.
Awaiting the US presidential election:
This is because the incoming administration may seek to enable (under Donald Trump) or curb (as Kamala Harris) Israel’s war effort.
Russia:
The war in Ukraine limits President Vladimir Putin’s ability to influence Middle Eastern events, despite Moscow having shown interest — including hosting Hamas and Iranian leaders in October 2023.
In the midst of the crisis, Beijing has sharply criticised Israel while concentrating on strengthening its strategic and economic ties with Iran and the Arab world.
However, China remains restrained in its security and military involvement in the Middle East - a long-standing position that has ensured continued US dominance in the region.
Telephonic diplomacy:
The Indian PM spoke to Netanyahu on the phone both in October 2023 and 2024,
expressing concern and offering solidarity.
He also spoke to President Mahmoud Abbas of Palestine,
reiterating India’s commitment to the two-state solution.
Keeping terrorism issue and the question of Israel and Palestine separate
This has allowed New Delhi to express sympathy and support for Israel after the October 7 terrorist attacks while refraining from backing its two-state solution of Palestinian sovereignty.
Emphasising the close connection between sustainable peace and a two-state solution, India has continuously supported UNGA resolutions that demand Israel to leave the occupied territory.
India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor:
Prior to the new crisis, India sought to spearhead the effort to capitalise on the regional reset through the planned India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor.
However, the success of India's connectivity ambitions hinges not just on a truce in Gaza and Lebanon but also on how the Arab governments handle the aftermath of the conflict.

**********Judicial Activism in India
Why in the News?
At a public event in New Delhi, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said that the exercise of executive authority by the judiciary or the legislature was not in consonance with democracy.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Judicial Activism (Meaning, Scope, Constitutional Basis, Examples, Criticism, etc.)
News Summary
About Judicial Activism:
Judicial Activism refers to the proactive role played by the judiciary in protecting and expanding the rights of citizens and ensuring that justice prevails, especially when other branches of the government (executive and legislature) fail to do so.
In India, judicial activism has been instrumental in shaping the country’s socio-political landscape by holding authorities accountable and upholding the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of India.
Meaning and Scope of Judicial Activism:
Judicial Activism implies the judiciary’s intervention in legislative and executive matters by interpreting laws in a manner that ensures justice, fairness, and constitutional values are upheld. It often involves:
Broad interpretations of the Constitution
to secure rights for citizens.
Directing government action
to address inaction or failure in fulfilling constitutional duties.
Taking suo motu cognizance
(acting on its own accord) of issues related to public interest.
Judicial activism primarily stems from the belief that the judiciary has a responsibility to ensure that laws are interpreted in a manner that protects the rights of individuals and preserves democratic principles.
Constitutional Basis for Judicial Activism:
Several
articles in the Indian Constitution
serve as the foundation for judicial activism:
Article 32 – Right to Constitutional Remedies
Article 32 is often referred to as the "heart and soul" of the Constitution, as described by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.
It empowers citizens to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of their fundamental rights.
This provision forms the backbone of
Public Interest Litigation (PIL)
, a tool often used in judicial activism to provide justice to marginalized sections of society.
Article 21 – Right to Life and Personal Liberty
Article 21 has been widely interpreted by the judiciary to include various rights that ensure a dignified life, such as the right to privacy, right to a clean environment, right to education, and right to health.
The
expansion of the scope of Article 21
is a hallmark of judicial activism in India.
Article 142 – Enforcement of Decrees and Orders of the Supreme Court
This article empowers the Supreme Court to pass any order necessary for doing "complete justice" in any matter pending before it.
This is often seen as a significant tool for the Court to act in the interest of justice, even in cases where statutory law may not explicitly provide a remedy.
Examples of Judicial Activism in India:
Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan (1997)
In this landmark case, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of
sexual harassment at the workplace
Since no specific law existed at the time, the Court invoked Article 21 (Right to Life) and Article 32 (Right to Constitutional Remedies) to lay down guidelines for preventing sexual harassment in workplaces, now popularly known as the
Vishakha Guidelines
These guidelines were eventually codified in the
Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)
In this case, the Supreme Court expanded the scope of
by declaring that the right to life and personal liberty cannot be confined to mere physical existence but must include the
right to live with dignity
The Court held that any law affecting life or liberty must be "just, fair, and reasonable," setting a precedent for
procedural fairness
in legal matters.
Impact of Judicial Activism in India:
Strengthening Democracy
Judicial activism has played a pivotal role in safeguarding democratic values by keeping a check on the powers of the executive and legislature.
It has ensured that the government functions within the framework of the Constitution.
Protection of Fundamental Rights
Through expansive interpretations of fundamental rights, the judiciary has protected individual liberties, thereby empowering the marginalized sections of society.
is a significant outcome of judicial activism, as seen in cases like
S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017)
, where the right to privacy was declared a fundamental right under Article 21.
Environmental Protection
Judicial activism has been a catalyst for environmental conservation in India. Landmark rulings, such as the
Taj Trapezium Case (1996)
and the
MC Mehta v. Union of India (Ganga Pollution Case)
, have led to stricter regulations on industries that pollute the environment.
These cases showcase how judicial intervention has directly influenced government policy.
Criticism of Judicial Activism:
Judicial Overreach
Critics argue that in some cases, the judiciary has overstepped its boundaries, venturing into areas reserved for the executive or legislature, thereby violating the
separation of powers
Some argue that judicial activism can evolve into
judicial overreach
, where courts make policy decisions instead of interpreting the law.
Lack of Accountability
Unlike elected representatives, judges are not accountable to the public, raising concerns that judicial activism might sometimes reflect the personal biases of judges rather than democratic principles.
News Summary:
During an event, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar emphasized that in a democracy, the separation of powers must be respected.
He stated that executive authority is solely the domain of the
executive branch
, while legislation belongs to the
, and judicial verdicts are the responsibility of the
He expressed concern that if the
exercises executive powers, it contradicts the principles of democracy and constitutional norms.
Dhankhar urged the public and intelligentsia to reflect on the issue of
Additionally, he touched upon the issue of
anti-national narratives
and stressed the need to address them effectively.

**********Visit of President of Maldives to India
Why in news?
President of Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu, arrived India on a State visit. This is the first bilateral visit of President Dr. Muizzu to India. He had earlier visited India in June 2024 to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers.
Maldives is India's key maritime neighbor in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and holds a special place in Prime Minister's vision of ‘SAGAR’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and India’s ‘Neighbourhood First Policy’.
What’s in today’s article?
Significance of Maldives for India
India – Maldives Bilateral Relation
Strategic Importance
Maldives is barely 70 nautical miles away from Minicoy and 300 nautical miles away from India’s West coast.
It is situated at the hub of commercial sea‐lanes running through Indian Ocean (particularly the 8° N and 1 ½° N channels).
It has potential to allow a third nation’s naval presence in the area.
Geo-political interest
Securing sea lanes of communication; Fighting piracy and sea-based terrorism;
Making Indian Ocean a conflict free zone and restoring its status as sea of tranquil;
Exploring blue economy and Enhancing trade; Security
of Indian expatriates working there.
China Angle
The Maldives has emerged as an important 'pearl' in China’s “String of Pearls” construct in South Asia.
Internal security angle: Radicalisation
In the past, the number of Maldivians drawn towards terrorist groups like the Islamic State (IS) had increased.
Political instability and socio-economic uncertainty are further fuelling the rise of Islamist radicalism in the island nation.
This gives rise to the possibility of remote Maldivian islands being used as a launch pad for terror attacks against India and Indian interests.
Background
India was among the first to recognise Maldives after its independence in 1965
and to establish diplomatic relations with the country.
India as a first responder and net security provider
In 1988, under
Operation Cactus
the Indian Armed Forces helped the Government of Maldives in the neutralization of the coup attempt.
India was the first to assist Maldives during the 2004 Tsunami as well as the water crisis in Malé in Dec 2014.
India had swift dispatch of 30,000 doses of measles vaccine in Jan 2020 to prevent an outbreak in the Maldives.
India’s rapid and comprehensive assistance to the Maldives during COVID-19 pandemic further reinforced India’s credentials of being the first responder.
Security & Defence Cooperation
A comprehensive Action Plan for Defence was also signed in April 2016 to consolidate defence partnership.
India provides the largest number of training opportunities for Maldivian National Defence Force (MNDF), meeting around 70% of their defence training requirements. India has trained over 1500 MNDF trainees over the past 10 years.
Annual Defence Cooperation Dialogue at level of Defence Secretary was initiated in July 2016.
Development Cooperation
The major completed and ongoing development assistance projects executed by India are:
Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital
Maldives Institute of Technical Education (now called the Maldives Polytechnic)
India-Maldives Faculty of Hospitality & Tourism Studies
Technology Adoption Programme in Education Sector in Maldives
National College for Police and Law Enforcement (NCPLE)
Infrastructure & Connectivity Projects under Exim Bank Line of Credit of US$ 800 million
The following projects are being implemented under these LoCs:
Water and Sanitation in 34 Islands
Addu Development Project (Roads and Land Reclamation)
Cancer Hospital
Gulhifalhu Port project
Hulhumalé Cricket Stadium: During PM visit in June 2019, it was committed that the Stadium will be built under Indian assistance.
Greater Male Connectivity Project
The project aims to connect Male to Villingili, Gulhifalhu and Thilafushi islands through a series of bridges, causeways and roads.
It is funded through a separate $ 400 million LoC and $ 100 million grant from India.
Bilateral Economic and Trade Relations
India emerged as
Maldives’ 2nd largest trade partner in 2022 & the largest in 2023
India-Maldives bilateral trade in 2023-24 touched almost $1billion with India’s exports at $892 million and imports at $86.84 million.
In November 2022, amid the economic challenges faced by the Maldives, India handed over a financial assistance of US$ 100 million.
In December 2022, the RBI signed a Currency Swap Agreement with the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) under the SAARC Currency Swap Framework.
This enabled MMA to make drawls in multiple tranches up to a maximum of USD 200 million from the RBI.
In 2023 alone, among the tourists who travelled to the Maldives, Indians formed the largest group of tourists with over 200,000 travellers.
Indian Community
Indians are the second largest expatriate community in Maldives with an approximate strength of around 22,000.
About 25% of Doctors and Teachers in Maldives are Indian nationals.
Muizzu's visit comes amid strained ties following his election victory last year, which was marked by an ‘
India Out’ campaign opposing India's military presence in the Maldives
Muizzu's current stance emphasizes mutual respect, non-interference, and collaboration, signaling a significant shift from his earlier anti-India rhetoric.
During his five-day visit to India, Muizzu will discuss strengthening ties and addressing the Maldives' fiscal challenges, as the country faces the risk of a debt default.
With its
foreign exchange reserves down to $440 million and substantial debt repayments due in 2025 and 2026
, the Maldives has received a credit rating downgrade from Moody's.
India has already extended $1.4 billion in financial support to the Maldives for various infrastructure projects, and the visit is seen as an opportunity to reinforce bilateral cooperation.

**********Trade not just globalised but now weaponized
Why in news?
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, speaking at the Kautilya Economic Conclave, highlighted the social and political backlash against globalisation over the past 25 years.
He emphasised that
trade has not only been globalised but also weaponised
, prompting countries to view economic transactions through the lens of national security. This has resulted in many nations, including India, adopting protectionist policies, such as anti-dumping measures, particularly targeting Chinese goods.
What’s in today’s article?
Weaponisation of trade
Key highlights of the speech delivered by EAM
About the concept
Weaponization of trade is when countries use trade tools to pressure other countries to change their trade patterns and support their political or economic goals.
This can include:
Embargoing other countries,
Selectively cutting off imports or exports,
Threatening to use trade tools, and
Exploiting a country's economic reliance on another country.
Basically,
weaponisation of trade means using trade as a tool of foreign policy rather than as an economic goal in and of itself
Not a new concept
This concept isn't new, with trade embargoes and restrictions existing for centuries.
Examples include the U.S. oil embargo on Japan in the 1930s, which some historians argue contributed to the attack on Pearl Harbor, and economic sanctions on South Africa, which many credit with helping end apartheid.
Shift Towards Targeted Sanctions
In recent years, the nature of sanctions has evolved from broad embargoes to more targeted sanctions on specific individuals or companies.
This began in the George W. Bush administration but has escalated rapidly since then.
It is more of financial sanctions rather than trade restrictions.
This shift has made it easier to impose sanctions by lowering the threshold for action.
China's Aggressive Use of Trade as a Weapon
China has pushed the weaponization of trade to new extremes, exemplified by actions like:
reducing trade with Norway after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu Xiaobo (2010) and
limiting trade with Australia after it called for an investigation into COVID-19's origins.
China has increasingly used trade as a tool for political leverage, imposing economic sanctions on countries that oppose its policies.
In 2021, Lithuania faced sanctions after it announced the hosting of a Taiwanese Representative Office.
Similarly, Mongolia faced punitive fees in 2016 for hosting the Dalai Lama, whose authority over Tibet is not recognized by Beijing.
Taiwan has also faced restrictions, with China blocking imports of citrus, fish, and other foods in 2022 in retaliation for a visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
China’s Control Over Critical Minerals
In 2023, China restricted the export of gallium and germanium, minerals essential for semiconductors and military equipment, in response to U.S. efforts to limit China's access to advanced microprocessors.
This highlights China's strategic use of trade to retaliate against opposing nations.
Push for De-dollarisation and Global Influence
China is advancing efforts to move away from the U.S. dollar in trade, pushing for the internationalization of its currency, the renminbi yuan.
This would increase its economic influence and ability to weaponize trade further.
Steps taken by countries
Global Pushback Against Coercion
The Quad countries—India, Australia, Japan, and the U.S.—have issued a statement rejecting coercive economic practices and advocating for countries' right to determine their own futures.
The G7 nations echoed this sentiment, opposing any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.
Economic diversification and supply-chain resilience
Creating alternative supply chains is key to countering the weaponization of trade.
One such initiative is the
Mineral Security Partnership (MSP)
, which includes 13 members such as India, the U.S., and the EU.
The MSP aims to ensure the production, processing, and recycling of critical minerals in a way that maximizes economic benefits for countries with mineral resources.
Friend-shoring
The practice of
"friend-shoring," where supply chains are limited to politically and economically allied countries
, is becoming more common.
However, experts warns that friend-shoring could harm global trade and undermine institutions like the WTO, reducing the legitimacy of multilateral trade.
Trade Protectionism
Weaponisation of Trade has resulted in many nations, including India, adopting protectionist policies, such as anti-dumping measures, particularly targeting Chinese goods.
E.g.,
India has imposed over 30 anti-dumping duties on Chinese products in 2024 alone
Concerns over job losses and the national security implications of technology have led countries to prioritize domestic industries and supply chains over economic efficiency.
Rising Protectionism and Job Losses Amid Globalisation
External Affairs Minister highlighted the social and political backlash against globalisation over the past 25 years.
While globalisation has created deep interdependencies,
it has also led to job losses and dissatisfaction with quality of life, influencing political outcomes in several regions
This has led to a rise in protectionism, with countries imposing defensive measures against foreign imports.
Jaishankar emphasised that trade has not only been globalised but also weaponised,
The minister pointed out that concerns over job losses and the national security implications of technology have led
Shifted Focus in Global Politics: Conflicts Over Reforms
He noted that conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia have
shifted global attention away from pressing issues such as reforms of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), climate change, and the India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)
Despite the diversion of attention, her reassured that the IMEC, which was conceptualised during the G20 meeting, remains a viable project.
India is engaged in ongoing projects with the UAE and feasibility studies with Saudi Arabia.
The minister stated that the need for IMEC has only grown stronger due to rising geopolitical risks, although progress has been slowed by the current focus on global conflicts.
