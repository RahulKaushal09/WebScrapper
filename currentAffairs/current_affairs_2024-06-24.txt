Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)
New bank to bridge credit gap for MSMEs
MSMEs in India:
MSMEs are often called the
powerhouse of the Indian economy
as they contribute significantly to employment generation, exports, and overall economic growth.
They reportedly account for
more than 11 crore jobs and contribute around 27.0% of India's GDP
The sector consists of
around 6.4 crore MSMEs
, with 1.5 crore of them registered on the Udyam portal and employs around 23.0% of the Indian labour force, making it the
2nd-largest employer in India after agriculture
They account for 38.4% of the total manufacturing output and
contribute 45.03% of the country's total exports
Significance of MSMEs and Problems Faced by Them:
Significance of MSMEs for Indian economy:
Labour intensive sector, promotes inclusive growth, leads to financial inclusion and promotes innovation. The 64 million-strong MSMEs are the backbone of the Indian economy.
Problems faced by MSMEs:
Problem of dwarfism:
While dwarfs (firms that continued to remain small despite ageing) consume vital resources (could possibly be given to infant firms), they contribute less to job creation and economic growth as compared to infant firms.
Lack of funding:
Most (90%) of the MSME funding comes from informal sources.
Poor integration of digital technologies:
Integration of technologies such as big data, AI and virtual reality (Industry 4.0) into manufacturing operations in the sector is still in its infancy.
Environmental impact:
The sector lacks cleantech innovation and entrepreneurship, which produce environment friendly products, promotes energy efficiency and has the potential to accelerate the transition to a circular and low carbon economy.
Proposal
Government is planning to set up a separate bank for direct lending to MSMEs.
Among the details to be worked out is the ownership structure of the bank, which might include a hybrid (public-private partnership) model.
Current scheme
The Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) primarily provides refinance to banks lending to MSMEs, helping to lower the cost of finance for these units.
Established under an Act of Parliament in 1990, SIDBI's majority shareholders include:
Government of India (20.85%),
State Bank of India (15.65%), Life Insurance Corporation of India (13.33%), and
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (9.36%).
SIDBI accesses low-cost funds from banks that fall short of their priority sector lending (PSL) targets.
SIDBI's growth prospects depend on the coverage achieved by scheduled commercial banks in meeting their PSL targets.
Additionally, state financial corporations and state industrial development corporations, among others, lend directly to MSME units.
Need for new bank
According to a report, MSME credit penetration is still 14% in India compared with 50% in the US and 37% in China.
There is a credit gap of Rs 25 trillion for the Indian MSME sector, reflecting the large untapped credit market.
The outstanding credit to the MSMEs by scheduled commercial banks expanded by 20.9% annually to Rs 26 trillion at the end of December 2023.
Access to adequate, timely and low-cost finance is seen as a key bottleneck, stymieing MSMEs’ growth to bigger enterprises.
A separate bank which understands the needs and the working of the MSMEs is required.
Large banks don’t understand the requirements of the MSMEs.

**********18th Lok Sabha session - Oath taking in Lok Sabha
Why in news?
The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will start today. Before the House can begin its legislative functioning, the newly elected members will have to take the oath of Members of Parliament (MP), which is provided in the Constitution.
Bhartruhari Mahtab, elected for the seventh consecutive time from Cuttack, Odisha, will be the first to take the oath as a Lok Sabha MP at Rashtrapati Bhavan in front of President Droupadi Murmu.
The President has appointed him as the Speaker (pro tem) under Article 95(1) of the Constitution until the new Speaker is elected. Mahtab will preside over the House during the oath-taking ceremony of his colleagues.
What’s in today’s article?
Term of an MP
Parliamentary oath
The five-year term of a Lok Sabha MP begins when the Election Commission of India (ECI)
declares the results
as per Section 73 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
From that point, MPs are entitled to certain rights as elected representatives.
For instance, they start receiving their salary and allowances from the date of the ECI notification
Additionally, the start of their term means that if MPs switch party allegiance, their political party can request the Speaker to disqualify them from Parliament under the anti-defection law.
About
The third schedule of the Constitution contains the parliamentary oath.
Through this, members swear or affirm to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India, uphold India's sovereignty and integrity, and faithfully discharge their duties.
Importance of the Parliamentary Oath Despite the Start of an MP's Term
Winning the election and starting the term does not automatically allow an MP to participate in House proceedings.
An MP must take an oath or affirmation, as prescribed by the Constitution (
Article 99
), to debate and vote in the Lok Sabha.
The Constitution imposes a financial penalty of Rs 500 (Article 104) if a person participates or votes without taking the oath.
An exception exists for ministers who are not yet elected to Parliament;
they can participate, but not vote,
in House proceedings for up to six months while they secure a seat in either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.
Evolution of oath over the years
The draft Constitution, prepared by the committee chaired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, initially did not invoke God in any oaths, emphasizing a solemn and sincere promise to uphold the Constitution.
During the Constituent Assembly discussions, members like K.T. Shah and Mahavir Tyagi proposed amendments to include God in the President's oath.
They argued that it would provide a divine sanction for believers while allowing non-believers to affirm solemnly.
Despite disagreements, Ambedkar accepted the amendments, recognizing the significance of invoking God for some individuals.
The last modification to the oath came with the Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act, 1963.
This amendment added the commitment to uphold India's sovereignty and integrity, following recommendations from the National Integration Council.
Process
Before taking the oath or affirmation, MPs must submit their election certificate to the Lok Sabha staff.
This requirement was introduced after a 1957 incident where a mentally unsound individual posed as an MP and took the oath.
MPs can then take their oath or affirmation in English or any of the 22 languages specified in the Constitution.
About half of the MPs take their oath in Hindi or English, with Sanskrit also becoming popular in recent years.
MPs must use the name on their election certificate and adhere to the text of the oath.
Deviations, such as adding suffixes or phrases, are not recorded, and MPs may be asked to retake the oath.
While oaths and affirmations are a personal choice, 87% of MPs swore in the name of God in the last Lok Sabha, with the remaining 13% affirming allegiance to the Constitution.
Some MPs alternate between swearing by God and affirming across different terms.
Can MPs in jail take the oath?
The Constitution specifies that if an MP does not attend Parliament for 60 days, their seat can be declared vacant.
Courts have used this ground to allow MPs in jail to take an oath in Parliament.

**********Lithium Mining in India
Why in the News?
Exploration of lithium in Chhattisgarh’s Korba district has moved a step further with one block advancing to the second round of auctions and promising deposits now being found in the initial exploration of another block.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Lithium (Properties, Applications, Availability, Top Producers, etc.)
News Summary
About Lithium:
Lithium is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a
soft, silvery-white
alkali metal.
Lithium is a special metal in many ways. It's light and soft — it can be cut with a kitchen knife and so low in density that it floats on water.
Applications of Lithium:
The most important use of lithium is in
rechargeable batteries for mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and electric vehicles (EVs)
Lithium is often dubbed as “
white gold
” for electric vehicles.
Lithium metal is made into alloys with aluminium and magnesium, improving their strength and making them lighter.
Aluminium-lithium alloys are
used in aircraft, bicycle frames and high-speed trains
Lithium has no known biological role.
It is toxic
, except in very small doses.
Where is Lithium Found Naturally?
Lithium makes up a mere
0.0007 per cent of the Earth's crust
and it's only found locked up in minerals and salts.
In 2023, the Geological Survey of India, found that
9 million tonnes
have been found in Salal-Haimana area of Reasi district of J&K.
India now has the third largest resource of lithium globally, but it will take time to convert it to reserves.
Global lithium production surpassed
100,000 tonnes
for the first time in 2021, quadrupling from 2010. Currently,
Australia alone produces 52% of the world’s lithium
Future of Lithium Production:
As the world produces more batteries and EVs, the
demand for lithium is projected to reach 1.5 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) by 2025 and over 3 million tonnes by 2030
Based on the above demand projections, production needs to triple by 2025 and increase nearly six-fold by 2030.
Lithium Mining in India:
Lithium exploration in Chhattisgarh's Korba district has advanced, with one block moving to the second auction round and another showing promising deposits.
This is a good news as recently, India has been seeing setbacks in the Lithium mining sector. For example,
cancelled auction in Jammu and Kashmir’s Reasi district due to low investor interest
halted exploration in Manipur's Kamjong district due to local resistance
Exploration efforts in
Ladakh
, and
Assam
have been less successful.
Local resistance stopped work in Manipur’s Kamjong district, Ladakh’s Merak block yielded poor results, and exploration plans in Assam’s Dhubri and Kokrajhar districts were abandoned.
Amongst these challenges, the National Mineral Exploration Trust (NMET) funded a private company that found lithium deposits in Korba ranging from 168 to 295 parts per million (ppm).
Since November, the Mines Ministry has auctioned 38 critical mineral blocks, including lithium blocks in J&K and Chhattisgarh.
While the Korba block attracted investors, the Reasi block did not and is being re-auctioned.
Preliminary surveys in Korba showed lithium concentrations in bedrock samples ranging from 10 to 2,000 ppm, while Reasi’s deposits exceeded 200 ppm.
Despite mixed domestic results, India has secured lithium assets abroad, such as in Argentina’s Catamarca province through Khanij Bidesh India Limited (KABIL), and is exploring opportunities in Sri Lanka and Australia.

**********ISRO’s Reusable Launch Vehicle ‘Pushpak’
Why in News?
ISRO completed the third Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Landing Experiment (LEX) of its winged vehicle ‘Pushpak’, at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) in Chitradurga, Karnataka.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is a RLV and How is it Different from Other Launch Vehicles?
What is the Significance of RLVs?
What is the History of ISRO’s RLV Missions?
What are the RLV LEX Missions?
Primarily, launch vehicles comprise three or four stages apart from the payload
, which needs to be launched into a polar or a geosynchronous orbit, depending on a mission’s requirements.
In ISRO’s 3-stage rockets
The first/ lowermost stage has solid fuel/ up to 4 liquid strap-on boosters in the GSLV;
The second stage has the Vikas engine powered by liquid fuel; and
The third and uppermost stage has a cryogenic engine, which uses liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.
In the 4-stage PSLV
The first stage has a motor using solid fuel augmentable with up to six solid-fuel strap-on boosters,
The second stage has a Vikas engine,
The third stage again has a solid-fuel motor, and
The fourth stage has two liquid engines.
The RLV that ISRO is building has only two stages
to propel the vehicle into orbit.
Once the fuel in the first stage has been expended
the vehicle will shed it
and carry on with the second stage.
The first stage will re-enter the atmosphere
and land in an autonomous fashion at a predetermined location.
After some maintenance, it will be available for reuse.
Low lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio
: In aerodynamics, the L/D ratio is the lift generated by an aircraft, divided by the aerodynamic drag caused by moving through air.
Cost-effective:
The use of two staged RLVs can reduce the cost of a launch by nearly 80% of the current cost.
Foundation for advanced technologies:
It has the potential to serve as the foundation for advanced technologies such as
Hypersonic flight,
Autonomous landing,
Return flight experimentation,
Powered cruise flight, and
Air-breathing propulsion systems.
Scientific, strategic and commercial advantages for India:
The building of RLVs will ensure that the country does not lag in important scientific and strategic areas and will also commercially help ISRO.
In 2010
, ISRO began developing a winged reusable rocket, taking the first step towards realising a two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) launch vehicle that could be fully reusable.
In 2016
, the winged vehicle successfully flew at hypersonic speed and touched down at a predetermined site 425 km east of Sriharikota, in the Bay of Bengal.
While several other related technologies have been tested through the years, ISRO’s RLV’s autonomous landing was only tested successfully in
2023
Currently
, ISRO is working on the
‘Orbital Reentry Experiment’
(ORE), which will be taken to orbit by a modified launch vehicle comprising existing GSLV and PSLV stages.
The vehicle will stay in orbit for a stipulated period, re-enter, and finally land autonomously on a runway, with landing gear.
The mission was accomplished by
Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) along with the Liquid Propulsion System Centre (LPSC) and the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU).
This is the third and final test in the series of LEX (03)
, following the success of the RLV LEX-01 and LEX-02 missions.
The third and final test
re-demonstrated the autonomous landing capability of the RLV under more challenging release conditions.
The mission simulated high-speed landing conditions
for a vehicle returning from space, reaffirming ISRO’s expertise in acquiring the most critical technologies required for the development of a RLV.

**********India among a select few countries that have not conducted the Census    
Governance
Why in the news?
India’s last census was conducted in 2011, and the scheduled Census 2021 has been indefinitely postponed, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. This delay has significant implications for welfare schemes and policy planning reliant on accurate population data.
Significance of Census Calculation
Foundation for Policy Planning and Governance:
Census data forms the foundational basis for policy planning and governance across various sectors such as education, healthcare, infrastructure development, and social welfare.
Allocation of Resources and Welfare Benefits:
Census figures are crucial for determining the allocation of resources and distribution of welfare benefits like food subsidies, housing schemes, healthcare facilities, and educational resources.
Monitoring Socio-Economic Development:
Census data enables monitoring of socio-economic development indicators over time, such as literacy rates, employment patterns, poverty levels, and household incomes.
Present Observations:
Global Comparison:
India is among a minority of countries (44 out of 233) that have not conducted the latest census, despite most nations managing to proceed with their census rounds after March 2020, amidst the pandemic. This delay places India alongside conflict-affected countries and those facing economic crises.
Regional Context:
Among BRICS nations, India is the only country yet to conduct its latest census, contrasting with others such as Brazil, China, South Africa, and Russia, which have completed their census rounds during or after the pandemic.
Dependency on Census Data:
Census data serves as the primary source for accurate demographic information at grassroots levels, crucial for planning and implementing welfare schemes across various sectors, including education, healthcare, and social security.
Implications for Society:
Welfare Scheme Implementation:
The absence of updated census figures hampers the effective implementation of welfare schemes such as the Public Distribution System (PDS), National Family Health Survey, and National Family Security Act. Outdated population data from 2011 leads to inaccuracies in identifying beneficiaries, potentially excluding millions from essential services and entitlements.
Education and Social Development:
Schemes like the Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS), aimed at providing quality education to Scheduled Tribe (ST) children, are adversely affected. Allocation decisions based on 2011 census data may not accurately reflect current demographic realities, leading to misplaced resource distribution and missed opportunities for targeted interventions.
Economic and Social Planning:
Census data plays a pivotal role in economic planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation. Without updated population figures, India faces challenges in devising evidence-based policies that address regional disparities, socio-economic needs, and demographic shifts effectively.
Conclusion:
The indefinite postponement of Census 2021 in India has profound implications for governance, socio-economic planning, and equitable development. Addressing these challenges requires expedited efforts to conduct the census and ensure accurate demographic data to inform inclusive policy frameworks.

What is Prompt Fission Neutron Spectrum (PFNS)?
Definition
: PFNS refers to neutrons emitted right after a Pu-240 nucleus captures a neutron but before it reaches a stable state.
Previous Studies
: To date, only one study has investigated PFNS for Pu-240-induced fission at 0.85 mega-electron-volt (MeV). Recently, researchers in the U.S. conducted a second study with neutrons of higher energy than 0.85 MeV.
New Findings
: The findings reveal significant differences between predicted and measured PFNS, aiding reactor designers and nuclear medicine practitioners.
About Plutonium-240 and its Fission
Neutron Capture
: When a Pu-239 nucleus captures a neutron, it can either undergo fission or become Pu-240.
Pu-240 is common in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapon test fallout.
Pu-240 Behavior
: Pu-240 capturing a neutron typically turns into Pu-241.
If Pu-240 undergoes fission, there’s uncertainty about the energy of its fission products.
Current models use complex calculations to estimate this output.
Do you know?
Plutonium is created from Uranium-238 in nuclear reactors.
Plutonium-239 is a weapon-grade fissile material (i.e. used to make nuclear weapons).
Pu-239 and Pu-240 are by-products of nuclear reactor operations and nuclear bomb explosions.
Relevance of PFNS Study to India’s PFBR
PFBR Use
: The PFBR uses plutonium from CANDU (Canada Deuterium Uranium) reactor spent fuel, which contains Pu-240. Reprocessed PFBR spent fuel will also contain Pu-240.
Importance of New Data
: New data on Pu-240 behaviour is essential for improving reactor efficiency and safety.
Production and Characteristics of Pu-240
Creation of Pu-239
: Pu-239 is created when U-238 is exposed to neutrons in a reactor. As Pu-239 captures neutrons, it turns into Pu-240, which builds up over time.
Spontaneous Fission
: Pu-240 undergoes spontaneous fission, emitting alpha particles, and is considered a contaminant in weapons-grade plutonium, where its composition is kept below 7%.
Reactor-Grade Plutonium
: Plutonium with more than 19% Pu-240 is classified as reactor-grade.
Experimental Findings on PFNS
Research at LANSCE
: Researchers at Los Alamos Neutron Science Centre (LANSCE) conducted tests by bombarding a pure Pu-240 sample with neutrons of 0.01-800 MeV energy.
Detection Setup
: The setup included liquid scintillators to detect emitted particles, using a small Pu-240 sample to minimize alpha particle emission.
Measurement Focus
: They measured the energies of neutrons and other fission products, focusing on neutron-induced fission data.
PYQ:
[2016]

Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Scheme; Its features.
Why in the News?
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the PM, approved the
Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme
for offshore wind energy projects.
Note:
Offshore wind energy projects refer to developing and operating wind farms located offshore, typically in
coastal waters or oceans
Back2Basics: Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Scheme
The VGF scheme is a financial tool to support infrastructure projects that are
economically justified but face financial viability challenges
It was
launched in 2004
to address the gap between economically viable infrastructure projects and their financial feasibility under traditional financing models.
Administration:
Administered by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, the scheme operates as a Plan Scheme with annual budget allocations.
Features:
Capital Subsidy:
VGF provides a grant (capital subsidy) to infrastructure projects to make them financially attractive for private sector participation. This subsidy helps cover part of the cost that private investors would find economically unviable.
Project Eligibility:
Projects eligible for VGF are typically selected through competitive bidding processes. They must demonstrate economic justification but face challenges in attracting private investment solely on commercial terms.
Disbursement Timing:
The VGF grant is disbursed during the construction phase of the project. However, disbursement is conditional upon the private sector developer making the required equity contribution to the project.
Budgetary Allocation:
Funds for VGF are allocated from the government’s budget. Sometimes, contributions may also come from the statutory authority that owns the project asset.
Limitations:
Additional financial
assistance beyond the VGF amount is capped at 20% of the total project cost
. This additional support can be provided by the sponsoring Ministry, State Government, or the statutory entity involved.
Benefits:
Encouraging Investment:
By reducing the financial risks associated with infrastructure projects, VGF encourages private sector participation, leading to faster project implementation and improved service delivery.
Infrastructure Development:
The scheme supports the development of critical infrastructure such as transportation (roads, railways, airports), energy (power generation, transmission), and public utilities.
