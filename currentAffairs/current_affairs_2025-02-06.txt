**********Story of NavIC - crucial indigenous SatNav system
Why in news?
India’s NVS-02 navigation satellite partially failed on February 2 due to engine non-firing, marking another setback for the
Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS)
, or NavIC.
Conceived after the 1999 Kargil War, NavIC aimed to establish a seven-satellite constellation by 2016 for defence and civilian use. However, only five of the 11 satellites launched since 2013 remain fully operational.
Despite ISRO declaring the constellation complete in 2016, failures and replacements have plagued the ₹2,250 crore program.
What’s in today’s article?
Failures in IRNSS Satellites
Current Operational Status of NavIC Satellites
Importance of the NavIC System for India
Future Plans for Expansion
Atomic Clock Malfunctions (2016 Onward)
Failures reported in rubidium atomic clocks used in IRNSS and ESA’s Galileo GNSS.
Each IRNSS satellite has three atomic clocks.
In July 2016, ISRO confirmed all clocks on IRNSS-1A had stopped working.
Despite this, ISRO stated the navigation system’s overall performance remained unaffected.
Clocks in IRNSS-1C, 1D, 1E, and 1G also developed issues over time.
Satellite Launch and Deployment Failures
IRNSS-1H, launched in 2017 to replace IRNSS-1A, failed as its heat shield did not detach.
The latest satellite, IRNSS-1K (NVS-02), suffered an engine failure in 2025, leaving it in a sub-optimal orbit.
Overall Impact
Out of 11 IRNSS satellites launched, six have faced failures, affecting India’s indigenous navigation system.
ISRO’s 2023-24 annual report says that following the launch of NVS-01 on May 28, 2023, five NavIC satellites are operational – IRNSS-1B, 1C, 1F, and 1I, and NVS-01 (IRNSS-1J).
However, according to some estimates, 1C is only partially operational due to the presence of the old series of atomic clocks that were reported to be malfunctioning.
Satellite Generations and Clock Issues
First-generation IRNSS satellites (1H and 1I) carried modified European clocks.
Next-generation satellites (NVS-01 and NVS-02) use a mix of indigenous and foreign clocks.
NVS-02 (IRNSS-1K) failed due to an engine malfunction.
Key Services Provided by NavIC
Standard Positioning Service (SPS):
For general and commercial use.
Restricted Service (RS):
For defense forces.
Offers
positioning accuracy better than 20 meters
across India and up to 1,500 km around it, with dual-frequency capabilities in L5 and S band.
Strategic Importance for Defense
NavIC ensures
reliable positioning data
critical for defense applications, unlike global systems such as GPS, which have military-encrypted services primarily for US and allied forces.
Global navigation systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou, QZSS) are mainly developed for military use, and NavIC provides India with independent and secure navigation.
Commercial and Consumer Adoption
For NavIC to become widespread, ISRO plans to partner with commercial service providers, including
mobile phone
vehicle manufacturers
Qualcomm, a mobile chipmaker, agreed to incorporate NavIC support in some chipsets in December 2023.
ISRO intends to launch
three more second-generation satellites
(NVS-03, 04, 05) to enhance the NavIC system and ensure continuity of services, despite setbacks like the NVS-02 engine failure.

**********Amid US-China Trade Tensions, India Enhances Investment Safeguards for Global Partners
Why in news?
India is preparing to revamp its
2016 model Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT)
to offer better protection for foreign investors, responding to concerns from Western trade partners amid shifting global trade dynamics due to the US-China trade war.
The Union Budget highlighted the need for reform, as India negotiates investment treaties with the UK, EU, and EFTA, which has pledged $100 billion in investments over 15 years.
The govt. has stated that groundwork has begun, citing the UAE BIT as a model for a more investor-friendly approach, including asset-based protection and coverage for Foreign Portfolio Investments (FPIs).
What’s in today’s article?
High Regulatory Risks in India Deter Foreign Investment
Local Remedy Requirement in UAE BIT
India Eyes Gains from US-China Trade War
Experts emphasized the need for stronger investor protections in India due to significant regulatory risks. The latest instance being the Nestlé case.
Switzerland suspended the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) clause in its 1994 Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India in December 2024.
This followed an Indian Supreme Court ruling stating that the DTAA is unenforceable unless notified under the Income Tax Act.
Consequently, Swiss companies like Nestlé now face higher taxes on dividends.
Impact of Retroactive Tax Laws and License Cancellations
Analysts have noted that India has faced numerous investor disputes arising from
retroactive tax changes
, such as in the Vodafone case, and arbitrary license cancellations, like in the Devas case.
These actions, coupled with prolonged judicial delays in arbitration, leave investors with limited recourse.
Shifting Away from Investor Rights in BITs
India's decision to annul older Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) after unfavorable international court rulings led to the adoption of the 2016 model BIT, which prioritizes state rights over investor rights.
The inclusion of an "exhaustion of local remedies" clause is intended to reduce international litigation against India.
The UAE-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) mandates that UAE investors must exhaust domestic legal remedies for at least three years before seeking international arbitration.
The India-UAE Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) came into effect on August 31, 2024.
This is a reduced timeframe compared to India’s 2016 model BIT, which requires a five-year waiting period.
Western Opposition to Long Waiting Periods
Many Western nations, including the UK and EU, are unwilling to accept even the three-year requirement, leading to prolonged negotiations.
While India’s talks with the UK have been ongoing for over two years, its negotiations with the EU remain stalled.
In contrast, the EU has signed investment agreements with competitors like Vietnam, giving them a competitive edge.
Proposal for a Fork-in-the-Road Clause
Many experts suggest eliminating the waiting period entirely and instead introducing a
"fork-in-the-road"
This clause
would allow investors to choose between domestic courts or international arbitration, with their decision being final and irrevocable
This approach, he argues, would give investors flexibility while still encouraging them to use India’s legal system to avoid straining diplomatic and business relations.
India is positioning itself as a beneficiary of the ongoing US-China tariff war, with early signs indicating a potential rise in Indian exports to the US.
Exporters have reported positive feedback on increased orders, signaling optimism for trade growth.
US Retaliation Could Boost Indian Exports
The US is expected to assess China's tariff measures, and potential countermeasures could further enhance demand for Indian goods.
Higher tariffs on Chinese products would make Indian alternatives more competitive in the American market.
India’s Past Trade Gains from US-China Tensions
India previously benefited from trade conflicts between the two global powers, emerging as the
fourth-largest gainer during the earlier US-China trade war
Indian exports surged from $51.63 billion in FY21 to $76.71 billion in FY22.
With a similar opportunity now, India hopes to replicate this success, though the extent of its advantage remains uncertain.

**********A Budget That is Mostly Good but With One Wrong Move
Context
The
Union Budget plays a crucial role in shaping a country's economic trajectory.
2025-26 Budget aims to accelerate growth, improve tax structures, and promote fiscal consolidation
while addressing emerging economic challenges.
It is important to examine the key aspects of the Budget,
including GDP projections, government expenditure, tax revenues, and concerns regarding fiscal transparency.
Key Aspects of the Budget
Economic Growth and Capital Expenditure
One of the most significant aspects of the Budget is
its projection of nominal GDP growth at 10.1% for 2025-26,
which is deemed reasonable given the Economic Survey's estimate of real GDP growth between 6.3% and 6.8%.
government's strategy focuses on increasing capital expenditure
, a critical driver of economic development.
For 2025-26, capital expenditure is estimated at ₹11.2 lakh crore,
a slight increase from the ₹11.1 lakh crore allocated in the previous Budget.
While the increase is relatively modest,
the government aims to sustain growth by boosting infrastructure and industrial investments.
However,
given India’s aspiration to become a developed economy, a higher growth rate of around 8% in real terms is necessary.
Budget introduces measures to stimulate economic activity, although some policies could have been implemented earlier
for greater impact.
Tax Revenues and Structural Shifts
A key feature of the Budget is the
shift in the structure of gross tax revenues (GTR) from indirect taxes to direct taxes.
Over recent years,
the share of direct taxes in GTR has increased from 52% in 2021-22 to 59% in 2025-26,
which is considered a positive development.
despite this structural improvement, tax revenue growth has been declining
:
GTR growth has fallen from 13.5% in 2023-24 to 10.8%
in 2025-26.
GST revenue growth
has similarly
declined, from 12.7% in 2023-24 to 10.9% in 2025-26.
Personal income-tax growth
slowed from 25.4% in 2023-24 to 14.4% in 2025-26,
partly due to new tax concessions.
Corporate income-tax growth was particularly low at 7.6% in 2024-25
but has been projected to recover to 10.4% in 2025-26.
Despite these declines,
the assumptions about tax revenue growth appear realistic.
Government Expenditure and the Need for AI Investment
The Budget also
emphasises fiscal consolidation, leading to a reduction in government expenditure as a percentage of GDP
from 14.6% in 2024-25 to 14.2% in 2025-26.
Although total expenditure growth at 7.6% is lower than the projected GDP growth
of 10.1%, the quality of expenditure has improved.
critical area for government investment is Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure.
Budget recognises that India needs to develop AI capabilities
to remain competitive globally.
Countries like China and the United States have made significant strides in AI investment
, with the US recently announcing a $500 billion AI infrastructure plan.
In contrast,
India’s technology sector has lagged behind.
government should incentivise AI research and development through tax concessions
and public-private partnerships to ensure India remains a leader in emerging technologies.
A Major Contention in the Budget Announcement: Concerns Over Fiscal Transparency
Departure from the Fiscal Deficit Glide Path
Fiscal deficit
, the gap between government revenue and expenditure,
is a crucial metric for evaluating a country's financial health.
In the Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Cum Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement of the 2024-25 Budget,
the government had outlined a clear glide path to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26.
in the 2025-26 Budget, the government abandons this explicit target, instead stating that the focus will be on reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio annually.
Ambiguity in Debt Reduction Strategy
new approach focuses on alternative debt-to-GDP reduction
paths rather than specific fiscal deficit targets.
Budget document presents three different scenarios for debt-to-GDP reduction,
based on
varying GDP growth assumptions (10.0%, 10.5%, and 11.0%) and different levels of fiscal consolidation
(mild, moderate, and high).
This
method introduces greater vagueness
into the fiscal planning process:
government does not specify a clear fiscal deficit target
for each year, making it difficult to evaluate progress.
alternative scenarios do not provide a definitive commitment
to how quickly the government will reduce its debt burden.
reliance on optimistic GDP growth assumptions (up to 11%) increases the risk that debt reduction projections may not materialise
if actual growth falls short.
Risks of High Government Borrowing and Crowding Out Private Investment
One major consequence of unclear fiscal deficit targets is the
potential for higher government borrowing
, which could lead to the ‘crowding out’ of private investment.
When the government borrows more from domestic financial markets
, it reduces the pool of available funds for private companies to borrow at affordable interest rates.
can lead to higher borrowing costs for businesses
, discouraging private sector investment in critical sectors such as infrastructure, manufacturing, and technology.
Reduced private investment can slow economic growth,
which contradicts the Budget’s objective of achieving high and sustainable GDP expansion.
Impact on India's Credit Ratings
Fiscal transparency plays a crucial role in determining India’s sovereign credit rating.
International credit rating agencies, such as Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch, closely monitor fiscal deficit trends and debt sustainability.
If fiscal deficit targets are unclear or absent, rating agencies may perceive this as a weak commitment
to fiscal discipline.
downgrade in India’s credit rating would increase borrowing costs for the government,
businesses, and consumers.
Higher interest payments on government debt could divert funds away from productive expenditures
like infrastructure, healthcare, and education.
To maintain investor confidence and creditworthiness,
the government should reinstate a transparent fiscal deficit target framework, providing a clear roadmap
for achieving both deficit reduction and long-term debt sustainability.
Recommendations for a More Transparent Fiscal Policy
Reintroduce a Clear Fiscal Deficit Target:
Instead of relying solely on debt-to-GDP projections, the Budget should restore annual fiscal deficit goals, ensuring better accountability.
Provide a Detailed Debt Reduction Strategy:
The government should outline a step-by-step plan to reduce debt levels, rather than presenting multiple alternative scenarios that create uncertainty.
Ensure Realistic GDP Growth Assumptions:
Fiscal planning should be based on conservative growth projections, avoiding overestimation that could lead to fiscal slippage.
Limit Government Borrowing to Avoid Crowding Out Private Investment:
Fiscal consolidation efforts should prioritize reducing the fiscal deficit, preventing excessive public sector borrowing that could hinder private sector growth.
Strengthen Transparency in Budgetary Disclosures:
The Budget should provide more detailed breakdowns of expenditure, revenue forecasts, and borrowing plans, improving public trust and investor confidence.
Conclusion
The Union Budget for 2025-26 presents a well-structured approach to economic growth,
tax reforms, and fiscal consolidation.
While GDP growth projections are reasonable,
capital expenditure needs to be increased further to sustain long-term economic expansion.
The move away from
transparent fiscal deficit targets
raises concerns about accountability.
Fiscal policy should remain
clear and specific
, ensuring that the government meets its targets without creating uncertainty in financial markets.

**********Paradigm Shift in India's Science Policy - From State Control to Private Innovation
Context:
India has historically placed high importance on science and technology. Initially, state-led institutions dominated the landscape.
Private organisations
, such as Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) or Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), were brought under the fold of the government, yielding successes like the 1974 nuclear test.
Over time, there has been
a shift towards a more comprehensive approach
, incorporating
private firms and universities
into the innovation ecosystem.
The Need for Intellectual Capacity in Private Firms:
requires intellectual capabilities in people and firms, not just in government organizations.
Comprehensive national power and GDP growth depend on private sector involvement in research and development (
R&D
).
Examples
from the US and France illustrate successful private sector integration into public-funded research.
Lessons from Global Models:
United States:
NASA contracts 80% of its budget to private firms and universities.
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was created at Caltech and later funded by NASA.
China:
Private AI research teams, like
DeepSeek
, emerged from algorithmic trading backgrounds, demonstrating the spillover effect of private R&D.
France:
Defence research is primarily conducted in private defence firms with government funding.
India's Shift Towards Private Sector-Led Innovation:
Policy advocacy:
A December 2024 paper argued for
taxpayer-funded R&D in private firms
Emphasized risk management
through contracting research to multiple firms.
Government initiatives:
Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF):
Allocating Rs 2,800 crore annually to private R&D initiatives.
Budget 2024-25:
Rs 20,000 crore allocated to private sector-driven research and innovation.
ISRO's new approach:
Contracting private firms for launch vehicles to enhance global competitiveness.
Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) initiative:
Allocated 18,693 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for AI research.
Private IT infrastructure firms to operate GPUs, making them available to researchers at $1 per hour.
Shift from state-owned research equipment to a ‘buy, not make’ strategy.
Challenges in Implementation:
Unlike procurement of tangible goods, R&D funding requires
adaptive auditing mechanisms
Need for legal reforms
, strategic public finance planning, and institutional restructuring.
Balancing risk and accountability
in contracting private firms for scientific research.
Conclusion:
2025
is poised to be a
turning point
in India’s science policy.
The country is embracing the idea of
shifting public money into private universities and firms
that produce cutting-edge research. The taxpayer gets more value for their money as a result.
When a private firm is working in an area, it will try to do the research well, because it also has
a direct interest in the knowledge sought to be produced
However, the challenge lies in developing
effective implementation frameworks
to maximize innovation and societal gains.

**********[6th February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: A Budget that is mostly good but with one wrong move
Economics
PYQ Relevance:
) Distinguish between Capital Budget and Revenue Budget. Explain the components of both these Budgets.
(UPSC CSE 2021)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on the
Capital Budget and Revenue Budget (2021),
objectives of Union-Budget
(2017).
The Union Budget’s forecast of 10.1% nominal GDP growth for 2025-26 seems reasonable, based on the Economic Survey’s prediction of 6.3%-6.8% real GDP growth. Although capital spending has gone up, it’s similar to last year’s budget. The Budget aims to drive growth towards becoming a developed nation, though some measures, like tax relief, could have come sooner.
Today’s editorial talks about the measures taken in the Budget. This content would help in GS paper 3 in the economy section.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Some measures in the Budget should have been introduced earlier and replacing ‘fiscal deficit’ as a key indicator is a wrong decision.
How realistic are the government’s tax revenue growth assumptions?
Gross Tax Revenue (GTR) Trends:
The growth in the Government of India’s GTR has been trending downwards in recent years. The buoyancy of GTR has fallen for three successive years from 1.4 in 2023-24 to 1.15 in 2024-25 (RE) and then to 1.07 in 2025-26 (BE). As a result, growth in the Government of India’s GTR has kept falling from 13.5% in 2023-24 to 11.2% in 2024-25 (RE), and to 10.8% in 2025-26 (BE). Within the government’s tax revenues, the growth rate of Goods and Services Tax (GST) has also fallen from 12.7% in 2023-24 to 10.9% in 2025-26 (BE).
Shift to Direct Taxes:
The structure of the government’s taxation has moved from indirect to direct taxes, with the share of direct taxes in the government’s GTR increasing from 52% in 2021-22 to 59% in 2025-26 (BE).
Personal Income Tax:
There has been a fall in growth from 25.4% in 2023-24 to 20.3% in 2024-25 (RE) and 14.4% in 2025-26 (BE). This fall in growth in 2025-26 (BE) is partly due to the announced income-tax concessions.
Corporate Income Tax:
The growth in 2024-25 (RE) is quite low at 7.6%. This growth has been raised to 10.4% in 2025-26 (BE).
Is the level of government expenditure appropriate, and is its composition efficient?
Overall Expenditure:
The government is estimated to spend Rs 50,65,345 crore in 2025-26, 7.4% higher than the revised estimate of 2024-25. The size of government expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been reduced from 14.6% in 2024-25 (RE) to 14.2% in 2025-26 (BE). Growth in total expenditure, at 7.6% in 2025-26 (BE), is lower than the budgeted nominal GDP growth at 10.1%.
Capital Expenditure:
Capital expenditure has been raised from 11.11 lakh crore rupees in the current fiscal year to 11.21 lakh crore rupees for the oncoming fiscal year
. There has been a steady improvement in the quality of government expenditure as the share of capital expenditure in total expenditure has been improving. This share has improved by 10% points over the period from 2020-21 to 2025-26 (BE).
Investment in Key Areas:
Investment remains a central theme in the Budget, categorized into three key areas—people, economy, and innovation.
Investment in people:
Includes the establishment of Atal Tinkering Labs, broadband connectivity for schools and health centers, Centers of Excellence for Skilling, and initiatives for Gig workers.
Investment in the economy:
Focuses on infrastructure projects, interest-free loans to states for capital expenditure, asset monetization, and urban redevelopment projects.
Investment in innovation:
Allocates funds to private sector-driven R&D initiatives and missions to support urban planning and knowledge systems.
AI Infrastructure:
The Government of India has to build up large-scale Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure in order to facilitate the adoption of emerging technologies.
⁠Is the shift away from using fiscal deficit as a primary indicator of fiscal prudence a positive step?
Change in Indicator:
One measure introduced in the Budget is to move away from fiscal deficit as an indicator of fiscal prudence. The practice of giving a glide path in terms of fiscal deficit is being discontinued. It has been stated that from now on, the focus will be on reducing the debt-GDP ratio annually.
New Target:
The central government aims to reduce its outstanding liabilities to around 50% of GDP by March 2031.
Debt-GDP Ratio:
In the 2025-26 Budget, the practice of giving a glide path in terms of fiscal deficit is being discontinued. Alternative paths of the debt-GDP ratio with nominal GDP growth assumptions of 10.0%, 10.5% and 11.0% are given.
The glide paths are indicated in terms of alternative growth assumptions and alternative assumptions regarding mild, moderate, and high degrees of fiscal consolidation. This makes the whole exercise vague and non-transparent.
Fiscal Deficit Target:
The fiscal deficit target for FY26 is set at 4.4% of GDP, revised down from 4.8% in the current financial year.
Way forward:
Restore Fiscal Deficit Transparency
: Reintroduce clear fiscal deficit targets with specific timelines, instead of focusing solely on the debt-GDP ratio. This would ensure greater clarity and accountability in fiscal management.
Enhance Investment Efficiency
: Prioritize strategic investments in key areas like AI infrastructure, R&D, and innovation, while ensuring these investments align with long-term growth goals and contribute to overall economic resilience.
**********What is the SC directive on sacred groves?
SC Judgements
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Forest Right; Forest Cover;
Why in the News?
On December 18, 2024, the Supreme Court ordered Rajasthan’s Forest Department to map all sacred groves using satellite and ground surveys based on their cultural and ecological importance, regardless of their size.
Note:
In Rajasthan, sacred groves, locally known as ‘orans’, are estimated to number around 25,000, covering approximately 6 lakh hectares across the state.
What are the implications of the December 18 order?
Conflict with the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006
– The order contradicts the FRA, which was enacted to recognize and vest forest rights with gram sabhas. Instead, the decision shifts control from communities to the Forest Department.
Loss of Community Autonomy
– Sacred groves, which have been traditionally protected by local communities, will now be governed by state authorities, potentially disrupting cultural conservation practices.
Potential Erosion of Traditional Governance Systems
– The transfer of management could weaken customary laws and traditional conservation practices that have preserved these groves for generations.
Legal Precedence for Future Cases
– By prioritizing the Wildlife Protection Act (WLPA), 1972, over the FRA, this order may set a precedent for other community-managed lands to be taken over by the Forest Department.
Impact on Livelihoods and Religious Practices
– Communities that depend on sacred groves for religious, medicinal, and cultural purposes may face restrictions under the new classification as ‘community reserves’.
What did T.N. Godavarman v. Union of India establish about the definition of ‘forest land’?
Broad Definition:
The Supreme Court established that ‘forest land’ includes not only areas understood as forests in the dictionary sense but also any area recorded as forest in government records, regardless of ownership.
Expert Committees:
The ruling directed state governments to form expert committees to identify areas that fit this definition of ‘forest land’.
How are sacred groves traditionally conserved by communities?
Watershed & Ecological Functions:
Many sacred groves protect natural water sources, prevent soil erosion, and regulate local climate. Example:
Orans (Rajasthan)
– These groves support perennial water streams and serve as critical grazing lands for livestock.
Strict Protection through Customary Laws & Taboos:
Communities impose strict prohibitions on tree felling, hunting, or resource extraction in sacred groves. Example:
Sarpa Kavu (Kerala)
– These groves are dedicated to serpent deities, and cutting trees is considered a bad omen.
Religious & Cultural Practices for Conservation:
Rituals, festivals, and community prayers reinforce the spiritual importance of these groves. Example:
Devara Kadu (Karnataka)
– Annual worship ceremonies maintain local participation in conservation efforts.
Community Governance & Management:
Local elders, priests, or village councils oversee the maintenance and enforcement of protection norms. Example:
Jahera (Odisha, Chhattisgarh)
– Tribal communities like the Gonds and Santhals manage these groves as sacred spaces.
Role in Biodiversity Preservation:
The groves act as biodiversity hotspots, protecting endemic flora, fauna, and medicinal plants. Example:
Law Kyntang (Meghalaya)
– Khasi communities conserve these forests, which shelter rare orchids and medicinal herbs.
Way forward:
Harmonizing Legal Frameworks
– Amend policies to ensure the
, work in tandem, recognizing gram sabhas’ authority in managing sacred groves while ensuring ecological conservation.
Community-Centric Conservation
– Strengthen
traditional governance systems
by legally empowering local communities to manage sacred groves, integrating scientific conservation methods with cultural practices.
Mains PYQ:
Examine the status of forest resources in India and its resultant impact on climate change.
(UPSC IAS/2020)
**********A green signal for India to assert its health leadership
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Health Sector;
Why in the News?
Recently, the Budget has acknowledged health care as a cornerstone of national growth and development.
What are India’s steps towards healthcare transformation in Budget 2025-26?
Increased Healthcare Spending:
The budget includes a substantial allocation of ₹99,859 crore to the healthcare sector, marking a 9.8% increase from the previous fiscal year.
Expansion of Medical Education:
The budget allocates resources to add 10,000 new seats in medical colleges across India in FY26, with plans to add 75,000 seats over the next five years. This expansion aims to address the rising demand for skilled healthcare professionals.
Strengthening Healthcare Infrastructure:
There is an increase of ₹1,000 crore allocation under the PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM), which aims to strengthen health infrastructure at all levels.
Digital Health Focus:
The budget emphasizes the expansion of digital health portfolios, including telemedicine and AI-driven diagnostic solutions, to bridge care gaps and offer efficient healthcare solutions to underserved regions.
Promoting Medical Tourism:
With the launch of the ‘Heal in India’ initiative, the budget aims to position India as a top medical tourism destination by introducing on-arrival visas for international patients and streamlining visa norms.
Healthcare Coverage for Gig Workers:
The budget extends Ayushman Bharat coverage to one crore gig workers, recognizing their contribution to the new-age services economy.
Support for AI in Healthcare:
The budget announces the establishment of India’s Centre of Excellence for AI, and the expansion of the Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL) initiative, will further propel research within the Indian healthcare sector.
What would be the implications of Customs duty exemptions?
Cost Reduction:
The budget includes a full exemption of customs duty on 36 life-saving drugs used to treat cancer, rare diseases, and other severe chronic conditions. This measure will significantly reduce the cost of these essential medications, making them more accessible to patients, especially those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
Improved Access to Medications:
The exemption extends to specific drugs under Patient Assistance Programs run by pharmaceutical companies, along with adding 37 new medicines and 13 new patient assistance programs by next year. This will improve access to critical medications for patients, particularly those with chronic conditions.
What are the objectives of synergy – ‘Heal in India’?
Promote Medical Tourism:
The ‘Heal in India’ initiative aims to promote medical tourism by simplifying visa procedures for international patients.
Establish India as a Global Healthcare Destination:
By enhancing hospital infrastructure and streamlining visa processes, India is poised to become the preferred medical destination for international patients.
What are the challenges in India?
Inadequate Infrastructure:
India faces a shortage of healthcare infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, leading to unequal access to services.
For example, India has only 0.9 beds per 1000 population, with only 30% of these beds located in rural areas. This is significantly lower than the WHO’s suggested norm of 3.5 beds per 1000 population.
The underdeveloped state of roads and railways, along with erratic power supply, further complicates the establishment of rural health facilities.
Financial Barriers:
A significant portion of the population faces affordability issues, with many households bearing healthcare expenses out-of-pocket.
For instance, a large proportion of the Indian population lacks health insurance coverage, exacerbating the financial burden and limiting access to necessary healthcare services.
High costs of intensive care units (ICUs), averaging ₹60,000-90,000 per day, are beyond the reach of most Indians.
Shortage of Healthcare Professionals:
There is a shortage of trained healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and specialists.
For example, shortages of surgeons, obstetricians and gynaecologists, general physicians, and paediatricians range from 74.2% to 81.6% of the required strength in Community Health Centers (CHCs). The doctor-patient ratio is significantly low, especially in rural areas.
Way forward:
Strengthen Rural Healthcare Infrastructure
– Increase investments in rural hospitals, improve transport and power infrastructure, and incentivize private sector participation to bridge accessibility gaps.
Expand Medical Workforce & Insurance Coverage
– Enhance training programs for doctors and nurses, increase medical seats, and extend affordable health insurance schemes to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for low-income groups.
Mains PYQ:
Public health system has limitation in providing universal health coverage. Do you think that private sector can help in bridging the gap? What other viable alternatives do you suggest?

**********India must address illegal emigration with empathy and urgency
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India-USA relations;
Why in the News?
The U.S. deporting dozens of Indians for being illegal immigrants is not unexpected or new.
What are the reasons behind it?
Illegal Immigration Enforcement:
The deportations are part of intensified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations aimed at identifying, detaining, and deporting individuals who are in the U.S. without proper documentation.
Large-Scale Illegal Migration
– Many Indians, particularly from Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana, attempt to enter the U.S. illegally through Mexico and Canada due to economic distress and job shortages.
What is the potential impact of US immigration policies on Indian students and professionals?
Legal Migration Channels:
The Indian government is keen on ensuring that legal migration channels to the U.S. for Indian nationals are not restricted by the U.S. administration. These legal routes include H-1B visas for skilled workers and visas for students.
Deterrence of Illegal Migration:
Both the U.S. and India are engaged in deterring illegal migration while creating more avenues for legal migration from India to the U.S.
Increased Deportations:
Deportation of Indian nationals from the United States surged by 400% in the past three years. In 2024, 1,529 Indians were deported, a significant jump from 292 in 2021.
Impact on Undocumented Indians:
Approximately 725,000 undocumented Indians reside in the U.S., primarily from Punjab and Gujarat. As of November of the previous year, 20,407 undocumented Indians were either facing final removal orders or were held in detention centers of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
How will this impact the USA?
Labour Market Disruptions:
Deportations can create labor shortages in sectors reliant on immigrant workers, such as construction and hospitality.
(Example: Indian workers contribute significantly to the U.S. IT and service industries.)
Diplomatic Tensions:
Large-scale deportations may strain U.S.-India relations, especially if handled insensitively.
(Example: The use of military flights for deportations sparked protests from other countries like Colombia.)
How might the deportation of Indian nationals affect the political landscape in India?
Domestic Political Fallout:
The deportation of thousands of Indians could become a political issue, with opposition parties blaming the government for failing to create adequate job opportunities at home.
Diplomatic Challenges:
The mass deportations could strain India-U.S. relations, particularly if deportees face harsh treatment, triggering diplomatic interventions.
Public Backlash:
The use of military flights and reports of inhumane treatment, such as shackling, may create anti-U.S. sentiment among the Indian public.
State-Level Political Implications:
States with high numbers of deportees (Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana) may experience political unrest, with local governments facing pressure to provide jobs and reintegration support.
Rise in Anti-Illegal Migration Policies:
The Indian government may be compelled to introduce stricter measures against illegal immigration and human trafficking networks, affecting those attempting to migrate illegally.
Impact on Indian Diaspora Relations:
The large-scale return of undocumented migrants could impact remittances, economic support for families, and the broader perception of Indian migrants globally.
What should India do? (Way forward)
Strengthen Domestic Employment Opportunities:
Implement targeted economic reforms, boost job creation in high-migration states (Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana), and address the root causes driving illegal migration, such as agricultural distress and unemployment.
Enhance Public Awareness & Legal Migration Channels:
Conduct awareness campaigns on the risks of illegal immigration while expanding safe and legal pathways for skilled migration through bilateral agreements with the U.S. and other countries.
Engage in Diplomatic & Policy Advocacy:
Strengthen diplomatic efforts to ensure fair treatment of deported individuals, negotiate favourable visa policies for Indian professionals and students, and collaborate with the U.S. on workforce mobility solutions.
Mains PYQ:
‘Indian diaspora has a decisive role to play in the politics and economy of America and European Countries’. Comment with examples.
