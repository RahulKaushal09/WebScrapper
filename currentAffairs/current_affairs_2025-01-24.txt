**********Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)
Around 59 people in Pune have been recently affected with Guillain-Barre Syndrome.
About
(GBS):
It's a
neurological disorder
in which the body's
immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system.
Peripheral nervous system
is the part of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord.
controls muscle movement, pain signals
, and
temperature and touch sensations.
GBS is also called
acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP).
It can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects
people between 30 and 50
Causes
The exact cause of the disease remains unclear, but it is often observed following a
viral or bacterial infection, vaccination or major surgery.
At such times, the immune system becomes hyperactive, leading to this rare condition.
Symptoms
Patients often begin with an unknown fever, followed by
weakness
and other
nervous system-related symptoms
increase in intensity
over a period of hours, days, or weeks
until certain muscles cannot be used at all.
Some cases of GBS are very mild
and only marked by brief weakness.
Others cause nearly devastating paralysis
, leaving the person unable to breathe on their own.
Treatment:
There is
no known cure
for this syndrome.
The most
commonly used treatment
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),
which is made from
donated blood that contains healthy antibodies.
This helps calm down the immune system's attack on the nerves.

**********Appointing retired High Court judges on ‘ad hoc’ basis
Why in news?
Recently, the Supreme Court proposed appointing retired judges on an ad hoc basis to address the backlog of criminal cases in High Courts. The Court also suggested revisiting its 2021 decision that restricted ad hoc appointments to specific situations.
Article 224A of the Indian Constitution permits the Chief Justice of a High Court to request retired judges to resume duties with the President's approval.
Although rarely invoked, this provision involves a detailed appointment process, previously clarified by the SC.
What’s in today’s article?
Appointment of Ad Hoc Judges
Conditions for Initiating Appointment Process
Past Appointments of Ad Hoc Judges
allows the Chief Justice of a High Court to request retired judges to act as ad hoc judges, with the President's prior consent.
Power and privileges of the ad hoc judges
These judges have full jurisdiction, powers, and privileges but are not considered permanent judges.
Both the retired judge and the President must consent to the appointment.
Procedure for Appointment
The 1998 Memorandum of Procedure (MOP) outlines the detailed process for appointing ad hoc judges.
After the retired judge consents, the Chief Justice forwards the name and appointment details to the state's Chief Minister.
The Chief Minister then submits the recommendation to the Union Law Minister, who consults the Chief Justice of India (CJI).
The CJI's advice is forwarded to the Prime Minister, who advises the President.
Supreme Court’s Ruling on Appointment Process
In the case of Lok Prahari Through Its General Secretary S.N. Shukla IAS (Retd.) v. Union of India (2021), the Supreme Court clarified that the recommendation for ad hoc judge appointments must be routed through the Supreme Court collegium, consisting of the CJI and two senior-most judges.
The court also established guidelines for initiating this appointment process.
Criteria for Appointment of Ad Hoc Judges
The Supreme Court in the Lok Prahari case addressed the issue of High Court vacancies and the mounting backlog of cases.
The Court acknowledged that ad hoc judges could help tackle these issues, especially given the significant vacancies in High Courts (around 40%).
However, it set clear guidelines for when ad hoc judges can be appointed.
The Court ruled that ad hoc judges can only be appointed if recommendations for filling less than 20% of the vacancies have not been made.
This decision aims to ensure that Article 224A is invoked only after the process for regular judge appointments has been initiated and is pending.
Trigger Points for Appointing Ad Hoc Judges
Ad hoc judge appointments can only be considered if:
The High Court has vacancies of more than 20% of its sanctioned strength (excluding proposals for appointment).
More than 10% of the pending cases are over 5 years old.
Recommendations for Appointment
The Court recommended that each Chief Justice should maintain a panel of retired or soon-to-retire judges for potential ad hoc appointments.
These judges should be appointed for 2-3 years, with 2-5 ad hoc judges per High Court.
The appointment process should be subject to periodic reviews.
The Supreme Court has noted only three recorded instances of ad hoc judges being appointed under Article 224A, deeming it a "dormant provision."
These instances include:
Justice Suraj Bhan
(1972) - Appointed to the Madhya Pradesh High Court for one year to hear election petitions.
Justice P. Venugopal
(1982) - Appointed to the Madras High Court, with his term renewed in 1983 for another year.
Justice O.P. Srivastava
(2007) - Appointed to the Allahabad High Court to hear the Ayodhya title suits.
Since the 2021 Supreme Court decision, there have been no further recorded appointments of ad hoc judges.

**********Making sense of Trump’s tariff threat
Why in news?
Policymakers and analysts worldwide are anxiously awaiting US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements.
Trump has proposed imposing 10% tariffs on imports from China, 25% on Mexico, Canada, and the European Union, and has threatened a 100% tariff on BRICS nations, including India.
While no specific tariffs have been announced yet, Trump has instructed his team to study China's response to the tariffs imposed during his first term before making further decisions.
What’s in today’s article?
About Tariffs
Strategies Used by Countries to Counter Tariffs
Trump's Tariff Strategy: Reality or Bluff
India's Vulnerability to Trump Tariffs
A tariff is a tax imposed by a government on imported goods (the US in this case).
Example of Tariffs in Action
Scenario:
Domestic US cars cost $120, while imported Chinese cars cost $100.
Result:
Consumers prefer cheaper Chinese cars, leading to increased imports.
Three implications of this scenario
Impact on Domestic Manufacturers
- US carmakers lose sales; Job losses or poor salary growth for workers; Limited creation of new jobs.
Trade Deficit Expansion
- More money flows out of the US due to increased imports over exports.
Consumer Benefit
- Consumers access cheaper cars
Reasons to Impose Tariffs
Protect Domestic Industries
A 50% tariff on Chinese car imports would raise their price to $150, making them costlier than US cars ($120).
This shift in demand benefits US carmakers and strengthens the domestic car industry.
Increase Government Revenue
Tariffs generate tax income for the government by targeting well-selling imports.
Lower tariffs (e.g., 5% or 10%) might be preferred to sustain sales while raising revenue.
Encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
Tariffs could push Chinese car manufacturers to set up factories in the US.
This creates jobs for domestic workers while ensuring affordable cars for consumers.
The country on whom tariffs are imposed (China in this example) has several options on how to retaliate.
Dumping
The exporting country (e.g., China) absorbs the tariff cost and continues selling cars at $100.
Goal:
Drive US manufacturers out of the market, gain monopoly, and later recover losses through higher prices.
Passing Tariff Costs to Consumers
Chinese firms add the tariff cost ($50) to the car price, raising it to $150.
Impact:
US consumers bear the cost, leading to higher prices and inflation.
Domestic carmakers may exploit this by increasing their prices (e.g., $120 to $140) without improving quality or efficiency.
Setting Up Factories in the US
China may consider FDI but may face challenges due to higher labor and input costs in the US.
Shifting production to the US could result in job losses in China.
Trade Rerouting
China might export cars to Mexico or Canada (countries with free-trade agreements with the US), where they are repackaged and re-exported to the US as "local" products.
Trade War
China could impose tariffs on US exports (e.g., corn or aircrafts).
The tit-for-tat trade war between the US and China during Trump’s first term led to severe disruptions.
Alternatively, China could devalue its currency (Renminbi) to offset the impact of tariffs, neutralizing their effect.
Transactional Approach to Tariffs
Trump is seen adopting a "wait and watch" strategy, using tariffs as leverage for favorable deals on issues like immigration.
Experts have highlighted Trump’s dealmaker nature, suggesting tariffs are part of a negotiation tactic.
They believe that White House has stated that tariff threats on Canada and Mexico aim to curb illegal migration and drug trafficking.
Recent threats against the EU indicate Trump’s intention to negotiate better trade terms rather than impose actual tariffs.
Trump's Unpredictability
Economists are cautious in dismissing Trump’s tariff threats due to his unpredictable behavior.
Trump genuinely believes tariffs benefit the US economy, creating uncertainty in global trade.
Limited Direct Risk for India
Global experts agree that India is not a primary target of Trump’s tariff policies.
They emphasized that tariff actions are focused on countries like China, Brazil, and Canada, where the US has significant trade deficits.
Bilateral Trade as a Key Factor
Tariffs arise from bilateral agreements aimed at achieving favorable terms for both parties.
India’s bilateral trade with the US is relatively small compared to larger trading nations, minimizing its exposure to potential tariffs.
Conclusion: Limited Impact on India
Given the current scale of goods exchange between India and the US, the impact of Trump’s tariffs on India is expected to remain limited.

**********The Impact of Immigration Policy Uncertainty - Lessons from the H-1B Visa Debate
Context:
Over the last decade, immigration policy
debates have become pivotal in advanced economies
, particularly in the US.
Initially centered on low-skilled workers, the focus has now
shifted to high-skilled professionals
, particularly those under the H-1B visa program.
The H-1B Visa Program and its Benefits:
What is the H-1B Visa program?
The H-1B is
a temporary, non-immigrant visa
that enables US employers to hire foreign workers in specialized fields like technology, engineering, and finance.
With a yearly cap of 65,000 visas and high demand, applicants are selected through a
lottery system.
Benefits to host and sending countries:
India's “Brain Gain”:
US IT demand spurred
skill development
among Indian students.
STEM
migrants’ return (33% according to a study) bolstered India's IT sector.
Successful
startup
founders in India
leveraged skills
gained in the US.
US perspective:
Tech firms emphasize the H-1B program's role in addressing domestic skill shortages.
Uncertainty in Immigration Policy - The Trump Era:
Trump’s immigration rhetoric:
Claims of H-1B
visa abuse and job displacement
dominated Trump’s 2016 campaign rhetoric.
The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index shows migration-related uncertainty tripled post-Trump’s primary victory in 2016.
Ripple effects on global labour markets:
India’s unique impact:
India supplies 70% of H-1B workers.
US-based job postings dropped by 15% post-Trump’s primary win.
India-based job postings surged, particularly in offshorable sectors like IT.
Firm adjustments amid uncertainty:
Firms reliant on H-1B visas shifted hiring to India to mitigate risks.
For every 10% higher reliance on H-1B workers, India-based job postings rose by 11%.
Jobs in India often replaced roles previously based in the US.
Economic and Strategic Implications:
Firms’ preemptive responses:
Despite no immediate changes to visa policies, firms adjusted hiring strategies in anticipation.
By March 2017, when the Trump administration introduced stricter H-1B rules, the effects of 2016 uncertainty were already evident.
Offshoring and service exports:
India-headquartered firms were twice as likely as US firms to relocate jobs to India.
Offshored jobs significantly boosted India’s service exports.
Lessons for Policymakers:
Unintended consequences of protectionism:
Policies targeting immigration restrictions may inadvertently
fuel job creation abroad
rather than protecting domestic jobs.
Speculation around immigration reforms can significantly
impact global hiring patterns.
Need for predictable immigration policies:
Beyond economic effects, immigration uncertainty imposes
significant human costs on families.
Stable and predictable policies are crucial for fostering a
balanced economic environment.
Conclusion:
The H-1B visa debate underscores the far-reaching implications of immigration policy uncertainty.
While aimed at protecting domestic interests, such measures can unintentionally benefit countries like India by
encouraging job relocation
Policymakers must acknowledge the economic ripple effects of public discussions and
prioritize stability
to mitigate unintended outcomes.

Editorial Analysis
**********A Grey Birthday for the Election Commission of India
Context
B.R.
Ambedkar emphasised the critical importance of maintaining the independence of elections
and safeguarding electoral rolls from executive interference.
This
principle laid the foundation for the establishment of the Election Commission of India (ECI) in 1950,
a body tasked with preserving the sanctity of elections in the world’s largest democracy.
As India celebrates the
75th anniversary of the ECI
on January 25,
also marked as National Voters Day, questions regarding the integrity of electoral processes loom large.
Ambedkar’s Vision and Concerns
Ambedkar's warnings
during the Constituent Assembly debates
in 1949 were
strikingly prophetic.
He
cautioned against the manipulation of electoral rolls,
either through the exclusion of specific communities or the mass inclusion of voters to tilt election outcomes.
Ambedkar envisioned an electoral system free from executive overreach,
where the inclusion or exclusion of voters would not be influenced by racial, cultural, or linguistic biases.
Seventy-five years later, this vision appears to be at odds with recent developments,
particularly in the case of the Maharashtra State elections.
A Case Study of Maharashtra Elections
The Discrepancy in Voter Numbers
According to the ECI,
9.7 crore voters were enrolled for the 2024 Maharashtra State elections.
figure exceeded the adult population estimate of 9.54 crore,
as reported by the Ministry of Health.
While slight deviations in such projections are understandable due to demographic changes,
the enrolment of 16 lakh more voters than the estimated population is an anomaly
that warrants scrutiny.
discrepancy is especially striking given that voter enrolment in earlier elections,
including the Maharashtra Lok Sabha elections held just six months earlier,
did not show such inflated numbers.
Anomaly in the Rate of Voter Registration
What makes the case even more perplexing is
the rate of voter registration in the months leading up to the State election.
In the five years between 2019 and 2024, only 32 lakh new voters were added
to the rolls.
However,
in the six months following the Lok Sabha election, 48 lakh new voters were registered
, 50% more than the total registrations over the previous five years.
sudden and dramatic increase suggests either an extraordinary mobilisation of previously unregistered voters
or a systemic failure to ensure the authenticity of these registrations.
Manipulation of Voter Patterns
ECI has confirmed that 48 lakh new voters were registered
during this period, but the lack of transparency about the verification process
fuels concerns about the authenticity of these registrations.
If these new voters were legitimate,
their overwhelming
support for a single political alliance would be an extraordinary coincidence.
Alternatively,
it could point to deliberate manipulation of the voter rolls
, as Ambedkar had warned decades earlier.
The Role of the ECI, Implications and Lessons
The ECI’s silence on these anomalies has only deepened suspicions.
The absence of detailed explanations
or a transparent release of data related to voter registration
has left many unanswered questions.
Critics argue that
the ECI’s dismissive attitude undermines public trust in the electoral process.
A common counterpoint offered by the ECI
and its defenders is
that opposition parties, despite having their own war rooms and organisational machinery, failed to detect and challenge
these irregularities.
this argument does not absolve the ECI of its constitutional responsibility
to ensure free and fair elections.
Maharashtra elections serve as a stark reminder
of the vulnerabilities in
India’s electoral system.
They
highlight the need for robust mechanisms
to ensure the accuracy and integrity of voter rolls.
The sudden and unexplained surge in voter registrations, coupled with the ECI’s lack of transparency, raises broader concerns
about the potential for manipulation in other elections.
The anomalies observed in this case are
not just administrative lapses but potential threats to the foundation of democracy.
By learning from such incidents and implementing systemic changes, India can ensure that its elections remain free, fair, and reflective of the people’s will.
Necessary Steps for ECI to Stop Election Manipulations
Address the Concerns About Transparency
The patterns in Maharashtra’s electoral rolls highlight the
need for transparency and accountability from the ECI.
Were these 48 lakh new voters real or fictitious? Were their documents verified during enrolment?
How did such a large number of new voters emerge in such a short span
, and why did they predominantly favour one political alliance?
These questions remain unanswered
as the ECI has opted for silence, leaving room for speculation about possible executive interference.
ECI must address all of these concerns to ensure the public trust
in free and fair electoral process.
A transparent and accountable ECI is essential
to address these issues and restore public confidence in the electoral system.
Integration of Aadhar with Electoral Rolls
One solution lies in
integrating Aadhaar with electoral rolls to eliminate duplicate or fraudulent registrations
and verify voter identities through biometric authentication.
Aadhaar’s robust framework can serve as a tool to ‘unghost’ electoral rolls
, ensuring that only genuine voters are included.
this system must be designed carefully to safeguard against disenfranchisement.
For instance,
alternative mechanisms should be available for individuals whose biometric authentication fails
, ensuring that no eligible citizen is denied their right to vote.
Conclusion
India’s electoral democracy rests on the foundation of trust and transparency,
principles that the ECI is mandated to uphold.
The concerns raised during the Maharashtra elections underscore the need for reforms
that reinforce the integrity of electoral processes.
By adopting technological solutions such as Aadhaar integration
and fostering greater transparency in voter enrolment,
the ECI can address issues of manipulation and restore public confidence.

**********India’s Winding Road to ‘#EndTB’
Context
Tuberculosis (TB),
a disease long considered curable,
remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide.
Despite
India’s ambitious pledge in 2018 to achieve the "End TB" targets by 2025
, five years ahead of the global timeline,
the challenges are profound.
While ambitious policies and initiatives are rolled out
from the national level,
the ground reality in India needs to be better understood
to translate them into effective interventions.
The Current Situation of TB in India, the Vulnerabilities of High-Risk Groups and Breakdowns in Treatment and Supply Chains
In 2024,
TB reclaimed its position as the leading infectious disease killer globally, with India contributing 26% of the global TB burden
, including drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) cases and TB-related deaths.
The COVID-19 pandemic
, logistical issues, and gaps in healthcare infrastructure
have further complicated efforts to combat the disease effectively.
Addressing the vulnerabilities of affected populations, improving diagnosis and treatment, and ensuring better program implementation are crucial to overcoming these hurdles.
The Vulnerabilities of High-Risk Groups
National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP)
identifies high-risk groups prone to TB, including individuals exposed to factors like silicosis, undernutrition, overcrowding, and uncontrolled co-morbidities such as diabetes.
Migrant workers are particularly vulnerable
due to poor access to healthcare.
Many, like
those in mining and stone-carving communities, face severe lung damage
caused by inhaling fine dust.
Migrant workers often return to their native villages when ill, disrupting their treatment
and making it difficult for healthcare systems to track their progress.
India has made notable progress in initiating treatment for over 95% of notified TB
cases, aided by an exclusive procurement and supply chain system.
However,
the system experienced a major setback in 2023 due to drug shortages.
Many critical medicines remain unavailable
in the open market, forcing families to bear catastrophic healthcare expenses.
Challenges in Diagnosing Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis
Diagnostic Delays and Misdiagnosis
first major challenge lies in the presentation of EP-TB.
Symptoms vary widely depending on the affected organ, making it difficult for healthcare providers to suspect TB as the underlying cause.
For instance, TB of the spine may initially present as back pain
, while TB of the brain (tuberculous meningitis) could manifest as persistent headaches or confusion.
Such symptoms are easily mistaken for other common conditions
, resulting in delayed diagnosis and advanced disease stages by the time treatment is initiated.
Limited Access to Diagnostics
diagnostic infrastructure for EP-TB in India remains underdeveloped
, especially in rural and underserved areas.
Advanced molecular tests like
Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (CBNAAT) and Truenat,
which are crucial for diagnosing EP-TB, are often
only available at district-level healthcare facilities.
Accessing these tests requires patients to travel long distances, which is both time-consuming and expensive.
Underprepared Healthcare Providers
significant number of healthcare providers
particularly in the private sector, are ill-equipped to diagnose EP-TB.
Studies, such as those conducted by
Daniels and colleagues in Mumbai, reveal that only 35% of private practitioners can correctly diagnose TB
based on classical symptoms.
Many private doctors,
driven by patient convenience or lack of knowledge,
prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics without conducting proper diagnostic tests.
This
reluctance to notify TB cases as required by national guidelines not only delays appropriate treatment
but also contributes to underreporting and the perpetuation of the disease burden.
Necessary Measures to Address the Challenges
Strengthening Diagnostic Infrastructure
Expanding the
availability of molecular diagnostic tools like CBNAAT and Truenat
to primary and community health centres is essential.
Ensuring a consistent supply of cartridges and reagents
, coupled with the deployment of trained technicians, can reduce delays in diagnosis.
Training Healthcare Providers
Regular training programs for general practitioners, nurses
, and frontline workers can enhance their ability to suspect and diagnose EP-TB early.
Emphasising simple diagnostic techniques
and clinical history-taking can help bridge the gap where advanced tools are unavailable.
Integrating EP-TB into Screening Algorithms
Incorporating EP-TB into routine TB screening protocols
, particularly in high-burden areas, can ensure that cases are identified early.
Training frontline workers to recognise the diverse presentations of EP-TB
can improve detection rates.
Community Awareness Campaigns
Raising awareness among the general public about EP-TB symptoms
can encourage early healthcare-seeking behaviour.
Community outreach programs should focus on dispelling myths
about TB and highlighting the availability of free diagnostic and treatment services under the NTEP.
Public-Private Collaboration
Engaging private practitioners through training,
incentives, and monitoring mechanisms can improve notification rates and
ensure that cases are appropriately diagnosed and managed.
Public-private partnerships can also help
in scaling up access to diagnostic tools and resources.
Ownership and Community Participation
Effective TB elimination requires ownership and collaboration at all levels.
A successful example comes from Idukki district in Kerala
, where partnerships with Kudumbashree,
a women’s self-help group, enabled widespread community participation
Advocacy by political leaders and cross-learning from best practices proved instrumental
in achieving and sustaining TB control efforts.
Program implementers must go beyond routine responsibilities
to adapt to local challenges.
Drawing inspiration from Vietnam,
which successfully used active case-finding for TB among high-risk groups,
India must explore innovative approaches to improve case detection and treatment outcomes.
Signs of Progress and the Road Ahead
Despite the challenges,
there are reasons for cautious optimism.
India’s TB case notifications reached an all-time high,
deaths declined by 24% compared to 2015
—exceeding the global average.
administrative structure of the NTEP is designed to address diverse contextual challenges,
offering hope for progress.
achieving the "End TB" targets by 2025 requires substantial restructuring
of conventional frameworks.
Investments in diagnostic infrastructure
, multisectoral interventions addressing social determinants, and
robust program management are essential.
Community engagement and cross-learning from international successes
can provide valuable insights to combat TB effectively.
Conclusion
Tuberculosis remains a formidable public health challenge in India
, exacerbated by socio-economic vulnerabilities, healthcare system inefficiencies, and logistical barriers.
While ambitious policies have been implemented
, bridging the gap between policy and practice is critical.
Through sustained political will, innovative strategies
, and community involvement,
India can make significant strides toward eliminating this deadly disease.
Although the
2025 target appears ambitious, consistent efforts can lay the foundation for a TB-free future.
