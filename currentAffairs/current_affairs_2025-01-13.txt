Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) Scheme
Amid global economic uncertainties, the industry has urged the government to extend key export-boosting scheme Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) for export-oriented units (EOUs) and special economic zones (SEZs) till September-end.
About
Scheme:
This scheme was introduced through an amendment to the
Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20,
and it became effective for exports starting
January 1, 2021
The primary aim of this scheme is to
offset the taxes and duties incurred on exported goods that wouldn't otherwise be credited, reimbursed, or refunded
in any way and are integrated into the exported goods.
It was enforced to
repeal and
reduce taxes for exported products
, thereby encouraging the conditions of exports and
increasing the amount of exports
in the country.
The scheme is
administered by the Department of Revenue
, Ministry of Finance.
It is a
WTO-compliant scheme
and follows the global principle that taxes/duties should not be exported.
replaced the Merchandise Export Incentive Schemes (MIES
), in response to the US challenging the Indian export subsidies under the MEIS at the WTO.
When the WTO dispute panel ruled against India, RoDTEP was framed to ensure that India remains WTO-compliant, while also supporting low-volume exports of commodities from India.
Tax reimbursement under RODTEP:
The scheme provides a mechanism for
reimbursement of taxes, duties,
and levies, which are
currently not being refunded under any other mechanism
at the central, state, and local levels
but which are incurred by the export entities in the process of manufacture and distribution of exported products.
This does not only include the direct cost incurred by the exporter but
also the prior stage cumulative indirect taxes on goods.
Eligibility
applicable to
all the sectors
involved in the export of goods irrespective of their turnover, provided the country of manufacturing of the exported goods should be in India.
Such an exporter may
either be the merchant or manufacturer
However, such
have been
directly exported by such a person.
Labor-intensive sectors that enjoy benefits under the MEIS Scheme will be given a priority.
Special Economic Zone Units and Export-Oriented Units
also eligible
to claim the benefits under this scheme.
Goods
exported through e-commerce platforms are also eligible
Re-exported products are not eligible
Process of Refund:
Rebate
under the scheme is provided to eligible exporters
as a percentage of the freight on board (FOB) value of exports.
Remission is
issued in the form of transferrable e-scrips
(a type of certificate with some monetary value)
maintained in an electronic credit ledger
CBIC
(Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs).
can be used for paying basic customs duty on the import of goods or may be transferred electronically to another party.

**********India’s Data Protection Rules Need Some Fine-Tuning
Context
On January 3, 2025, India reached a significant milestone in its data protection journey
with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) releasing the Draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules.
This
development follows the passage of the DPDP Act, 2023,
marking a crucial step towards operationalising a robust framework for safeguarding personal data.
The
draft rules symbolise a pragmatic departure from India’s earlier, more rigid data protection efforts,
emphasising
a balanced approach that avoids overreach
while promoting flexibility.
India’s Journey Toward the DPDP Rules
The Fall of the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB)
PDPB's downfall can be traced to its failure to balance privacy with economic and operational feasibility.
It
sought to impose rigorous obligations on businesses,
mirroring the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) approach.
Although the GDPR was widely regarded as a benchmark for privacy laws
, its rigid rules inadvertently created barriers to innovation and imposed significant compliance costs, particularly on small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
India's PDPB similarly drew concerns for being too interventionist and industry-hostile.
mandated exhaustive consent requirements and strict data localisation, creating fears that the compliance burdens
would deter foreign investment, stifle startups, and limit technological innovation.
The Shift to a Principles-Based Framework
shift from the PDPB to the DPDP Act and its draft rules represents a fundamental change
in philosophy.
Learning from the challenges of the PDPB and the limitations of global models like the GDPR,
India adopted a less prescriptive, more principles-driven framework.
DPDP rules focus on empowering users without micromanaging businesses,
emphasising simplicity, flexibility, and proportionality.
pragmatic approach reflects an understanding of India’s unique socio-economic and technological landscape.
Unlike the EU,
where a mature digital economy can absorb the costs of stringent regulations, India’s ecosystem is characterised by diverse entities
, ranging from multinational corporations to fledgling startups.
Avoiding the Brussels Effect
India’s decision to move away from the Brussels Effect
, a global trend of replicating the EU’s interventionist regulatory ethos,
is a notable aspect of this journey.
The EU’s GDPR
, once hailed as a gold standard,
has faced growing criticism for its unintended consequences.
hese include favouring well-resourced corporations capable of absorbing high compliance costs
, marginalizing SMEs, and failing to significantly enhance public trust in digital platforms.
India has instead chosen a path that prioritises outcomes over processes
By focusing on what needs to be achieved rather than dictating how to achieve it,
the DPDP rules aim to minimise unnecessary complexity and compliance fatigue.
Challenges and Ambiguities
The Complexity of Cross-Border Data Flows
One of the most contentious provisions in the draft rules is
the restriction on cross-border data flows, particularly the mandate for Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs)
to localise certain data within India.
The DPDP Act allows the government to notify specific countries where personal data
can be transferred,
but the rules extend beyond this provision, introducing added complexities for SDFs.
Such localisation mandates can have far-reaching implications.
For global businesses operating in India, maintaining separate infrastructure for data storage can significantly increase operational costs.
Gaps in Safeguards Against Misuse
draft rules lack clarity on mechanisms to verify the legitimacy of user requests
for information on data processing activities.
Without adequate safeguards,
businesses may face a barrage of excessive or frivolous requests, diverting resources away from their core operations.
For example,
malicious actors could exploit the lack of verification processes to overwhelm a company’s compliance infrastructure
or gain access to sensitive information.
Furthermore,
the rules do not specify whether businesses can charge a reasonable fee for processing such requests
, especially if they are excessive or unfounded.
Ambiguity Around Government Access to Data
A particularly concerning gap in the
draft rules pertains to the government’s potential access to sensitive business data.
While the rules grant the government the authority to demand information, they do not provide clear safeguards to protect this data
from misuse or exposure.
For instance,
businesses may have to share proprietary information, trade secrets, or confidential data with the government
, raising questions about how this information will be protected from competitors or malicious actors.
The absence of specific provisions addressing these scenarios creates uncertainty and creates apprehension among businesses,
particularly those operating in industries where intellectual property and trade secrets are critical assets.
Necessary Measures to Address these Challenges
Strengthening Procedural Clarity
A critical aspect of the way forward is to
address the procedural gaps in the current draft rules.
Clear guidelines must be established to manage potential conflicts
between user rights and business operations.
in scenarios where users request data correction or erasure, businesses need clarity on the extent of their obligations, especially if such requests conflict
with operational or legal requirements.
Addressing Cross-Border Data Flow Concerns
draft rules' provisions for restricting cross-border data flows require careful reconsideration.
While data localisation can address legitimate concerns around law enforcement access,
it risks deterring foreign investment and stifling innovation if applied indiscriminately.
A more nuanced, sector-specific approach could provide a solution
the Reserve Bank of India’s 2018 mandate for payment data localisation struck a balance between regulatory oversight
and business needs.
A similar strategy tailored to industries handling sensitive data
, such as finance, healthcare, and national security,
could address law enforcement concerns without burdening all businesses equally.
Rethinking the Consent Model
reliance on the notice-and-consent model, while traditional, is increasingly inadequate
in the face of modern technologies like IoT, AI, and 5G.
These advancements enable vast, often invisible data collection
in public and digital spaces where obtaining informed consent is impractical.
To address this,
India must explore alternative mechanisms that go beyond consent-based frameworks.
Anticipating Emerging Technologies
India’s data protection framework must also account for the rapid evolution of technology.
Innovations such as generative AI, augmented reality, and
autonomous systems
are redefining how data is collected, processed, and used.
The convergence of these technologies with 5G and IoT is creating a hyper-connected environment,
increasing the complexity of privacy challenges.
Future-proofing the DPDP rules will require integrating flexible, principles-based approaches
that can adapt to technological changes.
Conclusion
The Draft DPDP Rules mark a pivotal moment in India’s journey toward a modern data protection
However,
their potential will only be realised if the government addresses the challenges,
clarifies ambiguities, and prepares for the complexities of the digital future.
By focusing on innovation, ensuring procedural integrity
, and building public trust,
India can establish a framework that protects privacy while enabling economic growth
and technological leadership.

**********What is pink fire retardant?
As multiple wildfires continue to torch Southern California, authorities are using planes to drop a large amount of bright pink fire retardant to curb the blaze.
About pink fire retardant:
Fire retardant
is a mix of chemicals used to extinguish or slow down the spread of fires.
There are different types of fire retardant but to tackle wildfires in the US, authorities most commonly use
Phos-Chek
, a brand of fire retardant, which mostly
contains an ammonium phosphate-based slurry.
It is made of salts such
as ammonium polyphosphate
, which does not evaporate easily like water and stays for longer.
Colour is usually added to the fire retardant to ensure that firefighters can see it against the landscape.
This helps them create fire lines around the fire retardant, potentially saving lives and property.
What are the concerns?
Environmental experts have said that spraying fire retardant using planes is ineffective, expensive and a growing source of pollution for rivers and streams.
Phos-Chek “is laden with toxic metals, and estimates retardant use has released 850,000 pounds of these chemicals into the environment since 2009.
These toxic metals include chromium and cadmium which can cause cancer, and kidney and liver diseases in humans and these toxic metals can kill aquatic life.

**********Pink fire retardant is being used to curb California wildfires
Why in news?
Wildfires in Southern California have prompted authorities to deploy planes and helicopters to combat the blaze. Nine planes are spraying pink fire retardant, a long-used product, and 20 helicopters are dropping water.
While the fire retardant has been in use for decades, recent research questions its effectiveness and potential environmental impact.
What’s in today’s article?
What is the pink fire retardant?
Concerns Over Fire Retardant Use
What is Fire Retardant?
Fire retardant is a chemical mixture designed to extinguish or slow the spread of fires.
It is commonly used to combat wildfires, with
Phos-Chek
being the most widely used brand in the US
Composition of Phos-Chek
Phos-Chek is primarily a mixture of water, fertilizer (ammonium phosphate), and rust-based red color.
The formulation may also include thickening agents to control viscosity and prevent the material from drifting.
The key active ingredient is ammonium phosphate
, which helps slow the spread of fires by cooling and coating fuels, depleting oxygen, and altering how fuels burn.
Unlike water, it does not evaporate easily and remains effective for a longer duration.
How It Works
Phos-Chek reacts with cellulose in plant matter, consuming heat from the fire and producing non-flammable carbon material.
This process slows or stops the fire's spread, especially in areas with homes or structures.
Strategic Application
Fire retardant is typically dropped at the edges of fires to create barriers, preventing the flames from spreading.
Unlike water, the fertilizer-based active ingredient remains effective even after water evaporates, leaving a protective layer for days or weeks.
Large air tankers can release up to 9,400 gallons of Phos-Chek in a single drop.
Importance of the Pink Colour
A pink dye is added to the fire retardant for visibility against the landscape, enabling firefighters to create fire lines effectively.
According to experts, pink is the most visible and aesthetically pleasing option.
Environmental Impact
Spraying fire retardant via planes is criticized for being ineffective, costly, and a significant source of pollution to rivers and streams.
A 2024 USC study revealed that Phos-Chek contains toxic metals like chromium and cadmium, which can harm aquatic life and potentially cause cancer, kidney, and liver diseases in humans.
Questionable Effectiveness
Assigning credit to aerial retardants is challenging as they are one of many firefighting methods.
Their effectiveness depends on environmental factors like slope, fuel type, terrain, and weather, as noted by Forest Service scientists.
Limited Scope of Use
Experts state that aerial retardants work under a narrow range of conditions, which are increasingly rare due to climate change.
Growing Usage Amid Intensifying Wildfires
Rising global temperatures are expected to make wildfires more frequent and intense, escalating the use of aerial fire retardants.
Between 2009 and 2021, over 440 million gallons of retardant were deployed in the US, releasing more than 400 tons of heavy metals into the environment.
Ongoing Debate
Environmental experts, the federal government, and manufacturers are at odds over the environmental and health risks posed by fire retardants, sparking an ongoing debate.

**********Kumbh Mela Explained
Why in news?
The Maha Kumbh 2025, a grand religious event held every 12 years, will take place in Prayagraj, starting on January 13, with the first holy bath (snan).
Expected to attract over 45 crore devotees over one-and-a-half months, it is one of the largest gatherings on earth. While its exact origins are debated—some tracing it to the Vedas and Puranas and others to the past two centuries—it remains a significant spiritual and cultural festival.
What’s in today’s article?
The Kumbh Mela
Astrological Basis of Kumbh Mela
Historical References to Kumbh Mela
How Kumbh Mela became a platform for nationalism during Independence movement?
Origin
The Sanskrit word "kumbh" means pitcher or pot.
According to mythology, during the ocean churning by Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons), Dhanvantri emerged with a pitcher of amrita (elixir of immortality).
To prevent Asuras from getting it, Jayant, Indra’s son, fled with the pot, protected by the Sun, Shani, Brihaspati (Jupiter), and the Moon.
As Jayant ran for 12 divine days (equal to 12 human years), amrita spilled at four locations:
Haridwar, Prayagraj, Ujjain, and Nashik-Trimbakeshwar
Frequency
Maha Kumbh (Poorna Kumbh)
: Held every 12 years.
Ardh-Kumbh
: Held in Prayagraj and Haridwar every 6 years.
Significance of the Rivers
The festivals occur on the banks of sacred rivers:
: Ganga
: Confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati
: Kshipra (believed to emerge from Vishnu’s heart in his Varah avatar)
: Godavari (known as the Ganga of the south)
Bathing in these rivers during Kumbh, under specific celestial alignments, is believed to cleanse sins and provide spiritual merit (punya).
Gathering of Sadhus and Spiritual Learning
Kumbh Melas attract Sadhus and holy men, especially from the akhadas, providing opportunities for devotees to meet and learn from them.
The site of a Kumbh Mela is determined by astrological calculations based on the
positions of Jupiter, the Sun, and the Moon
Jupiter’s 12-year revolution around the Sun also explains the 12-year gap between Kumbh Melas.
Astrological alignments unique to each site guide the timing and location of the Kumbh Mela.
Ancient References to Kumbh Mela
The Skanda Purana is often cited as proof of Kumbh Mela’s antiquity, but no extant version explicitly describes the festival as we know it.
The Samudra Manthan story, though mentioned in various scriptures, lacks references to the spilling of amrita at four places.
Some claim the Rig Veda includes shlokas highlighting the benefits of participating in the Kumbh Mela.
Xuanzang's Account
Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang
described a seventh-century fair in Prayag, but it is unclear whether it was the Kumbh Mela.
Kama Maclean suggests that an ancient bathing festival, Magh Mela, held at Prayag was rebranded as the “timeless” Kumbh after 1857 to avoid British interference.
Adi Shankaracharya’s Role
The 8th-century philosopher Adi Shankaracharya is believed to have formalized the four periodic fairs, creating opportunities for Hindu ascetics and scholars to gather and guide the public.
Evolution of Kumbh Mela
According to some experts, the Kumbh Mela likely began at Haridwar, as Brihaspati (Jupiter) in Kumbh rashi corresponds to this site.
The tradition possibly took shape after the 12th century CE during the Bhakti movement, as fairs on sacred riverbanks are an ancient Hindu tradition.
They link the Kumbh’s origins to Ganga worship and the influence of travelling sadhus, who spread the idea of holding Kumbh Melas at four sacred rivers.
Historical Records
Mughal-era records and those kept by sanyasi akhadas indicate the Kumbh Mela was formalized over time, evolving into a major socio-religious event.
These gatherings provided opportunities for ascetics to earn followers and for pilgrims to engage in spiritual practices.
Allahabad’s Rise as a Political and Cultural Hub
Following the 1857 revolt, Allahabad became the capital of the North-Western Provinces, gaining prominence as a political and administrative center.
With institutions like the High Court (1867) and Allahabad University (1887), the city attracted influential families, students, and nationalists.
By the late 19th century, Allahabad had transformed into a significant site for political and religious activities, including the Kumbh Mela.
Religious Festivals as a Platform for Nationalism
From the late 19th century, the Kumbh Mela evolved into a platform for disseminating nationalist ideas.
The British policy of non-interference in religion allowed Indian leaders to leverage religious gatherings for political purposes.
By the 1900s, nationalist leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Gopal Krishna Gokhale used the Kumbh to promote Swadeshi and other nationalist causes
The Role of Congress and Religious Leaders
By the 1930s, the Congress Party actively used Kumbh Melas for political mobilization.
Sadhus and ascetics played a key role in spreading nationalist messages, blending religious authority with Congress policies.
Events like the 1936 Ardh Kumbh saw displays such as the idol of Bharat Mata and political processions that aligned spiritual and nationalist sentiments
Conclusion
The Kumbh Mela evolved from a regional religious gathering to a significant national event with political undertones, especially during the Indian freedom struggle.
Its transformation was influenced by nationalist leaders, local priests, and ascetics, who used it as a stage for resistance against colonial rule and the assertion of India’s political sovereignty.

What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Historical Context, Current Process)
Linking with Aadhar (Advantages, Challenges, Concerns, Way Ahead, etc.)
Conclusion
Introduction:
The debate over linking Election Photo Identity Card (EPIC) with Aadhaar has been reignited amidst allegations of electoral roll manipulation.
Prominent political parties have accused each other of tampering with voter lists, especially ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections.
This issue draws attention to the potential benefits and challenges of such a linkage.
Historical Context:
Initial Steps (2015):
National Electoral Rolls Purification and Authentication Program (NERPAP)
was launched by the Election Commission (EC) to address duplicate entries in electoral rolls.
The program aimed to authenticate voter data by linking EPIC with Aadhaar. Within three months, over 300 million voters were linked.
Supreme Court Intervention (2015):
The program was halted after the Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar's mandatory use should be limited to welfare schemes and PAN linking.
Revival (Post-2018):
Following the
Puttaswamy judgment
, which upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, the Representation of the People Act, 1950, was amended in 2021 to enable the voluntary linking of voter IDs with Aadhaar.
Current Process:
Submission Requirements:
New voters can provide Aadhaar during registration using
Form 6
, while existing voters can use
Form 6B
for authentication.
If a voter does not have Aadhaar, alternative documents like a PAN card, driving license, or passport can be submitted.
Voluntary Nature:
The EC clarified in 2023 that linking Aadhaar is not mandatory and ensured no voter will be excluded for failing to provide it.
However, forms have not been updated to reflect this clarification, causing confusion.
Advantages of Linking Aadhaar with Voter IDs:
Elimination of Duplicates:
Linking Aadhaar can help remove duplicate or fraudulent entries, ensuring cleaner electoral rolls. Currently, over 650 million Aadhaar numbers have been linked.
Improved Electoral Integrity:
Accurate voter data can strengthen the electoral process by reducing instances of impersonation and ensuring fair elections.
Administrative Efficiency:
A streamlined voter database can reduce administrative overhead during elections, making the process more efficient.
Challenges and Concerns:
Errors in Aadhaar Database:
Even minor inaccuracies in Aadhaar data can lead to wrongful deletion or rejection of legitimate voter entries.
Proof of Citizenship:
Aadhaar is a proof of residence, not citizenship. Linking Aadhaar will not address the issue of non-citizens being on electoral rolls, requiring separate measures by the EC.
Privacy Risks:
Electoral rolls are widely circulated among political parties, and linking Aadhaar may risk misuse of personal data, even if Aadhaar numbers are only linked in the backend.
Public Misconceptions:
Many voters fear that linking Aadhaar with voter IDs might compromise the secrecy of their votes, leading to reduced confidence in the system.
The Way Forward:
Transparent Communication:
Public awareness campaigns are necessary to educate voters about the benefits of Aadhaar linkage and address misconceptions regarding data security and voter secrecy.
Updating Forms:
The EC must urgently update forms to explicitly state that providing Aadhaar is voluntary, as clarified in the 2023 Supreme Court submission.
Data Security Measures:
Strong safeguards must be implemented to prevent misuse of Aadhaar-linked electoral data, ensuring voter confidence.
Separate Citizenship Verification:
To ensure only citizens are on electoral rolls, the EC should develop independent methods of verifying citizenship, apart from Aadhaar linkage.
Conclusion:
The right to vote is a fundamental component of free and fair elections, integral to India's democratic framework.
While linking voter IDs with Aadhaar can enhance the integrity of the electoral process, it must be implemented with caution to address privacy concerns, data errors, and misconceptions.
A balanced approach, combining transparency, data security, and improved administrative measures, will be key to gaining public trust and strengthening the democratic process.

**********Centre-State Clashes on Vice Chancellor Appointments
Why in News?
The University Grants Commission (UGC) has proposed new regulations for appointing Vice Chancellors (VCs) in universities, sparking disputes between states and the Centre.
What’s in Today’s Article?
New Regulations for Appointing VCs in Universities
How VCs are Appointed?
Key Provisions of the Draft Regulations 2025
State vs Centre Disputes over VC Appointments
Federalism Concerns over VCs Appointments
Conclusion
New Regulations for Appointing VCs in Universities:
Name:
The draft UGC (Minimum Qualifications for Appointment and Promotion of Teachers and Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education) Regulations, 2025.
Objective:
It aims to standardize appointment processes but has drawn criticism for allegedly undermining state rights and federalism.
Central universities:
Central universities are established under parliamentary Acts and administered by the Centre, with the President of India acting as Visitor.
VC appointment committees include two nominees from the university’s Executive Council and one from the Visitor.
State universities:
State-specific laws often determine the composition of search committees.
Typically, the Chancellor (usually the Governor) selects the VC based on committee recommendations.
For instance, Kerala’s law includes nominees from the university Senate, UGC Chairman, and Chancellor.
Private universities:
Private institutions follow similar procedures, with UGC playing a limited role through its nominee in the search committee.
Key Provisions of the Draft Regulations 2025:
Committee composition changes:
The new rules specify that the
search-cum-selection committee
will have three members, including one each nominated by the Chancellor/Visitor, the UGC Chairman, and the university’s apex body (e.g., Senate or Syndicate).
This grants a majority to Centre-aligned nominees in the committee.
Eligibility expansion:
Besides professors, individuals from senior roles in industries, public policy, administration, or public sector undertakings may now qualify as VCs.
Chancellor’s role:
The Chancellor or Visitor will directly constitute the search committee, a departure from the 2018 guidelines.
State vs Centre Disputes over VC Appointments:
Kerala:
Conflict started in 2021 when Governor Arif Mohammad Khan contested VC reappointments.
The state passed a Bill to replace the Governor as Chancellor, which awaits Presidential assent.
West Bengal:
The Supreme Court is involved in resolving disputes over interim VC appointments made unilaterally by the Governor.
The state Assembly’s move to replace the Governor with the Chief Minister as Chancellor is stalled due to lack of gubernatorial assent.
Karnataka:
Proposed legislative reforms aim to remove the Governor as Chancellor. Bills are awaiting approval.
Maharashtra:
Attempts to limit the Governor’s role in VC appointments were reversed under the new government in 2022.
Tamil Nadu:
The DMK-led government’s efforts to appoint VCs without Governor approval remain blocked.
Federalism Concerns over VCs Appointments:
State governments have raised alarms over the draft regulations, citing:
Erosion of State autonomy:
States argue that these rules centralize power in the hands of Governors, undermining federal principles.
Democratic concerns:
Critics see it as a move to weaken democratically elected state governments.
State leaders’ reactions:
Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan:
Described the draft as “anti-federal” and an overreach into state rights.
Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin:
Called it a “direct assault on federalism.”
UGC’s stance:
UGC Chairman M Jagadesh Kumar defended the regulations as necessary for aligning with the
National Education Policy 2020
and ensuring transparent, high-quality leadership in higher education.
Conclusion:
The proposed UGC regulations have intensified ongoing Centre-state tensions, particularly over Governors’ roles in university administration. While the Centre justifies these reforms as quality-driven, state governments view them as a threat to federalism and their autonomy in education governance.
The resolution of these disputes will significantly shape higher education and federal-state dynamics in India.

**********The challenge of holding judges accountable
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to the Judiciary;
Why in the News?
Two political parties have accused each other of tampering the voter lists before the Delhi Assembly elections. This has brought back the discussion about linking voter IDs (EPIC) with Aadhaar numbers.
Why was the National Electoral Rolls Purification and Authentication Program?
The National Electoral Rolls Purification and Authentication Program (NERPAP) was launched by the Election Commission of India on March 3, 2015, with the primary goal of creating an error-free and authenticated electoral roll.
Linking EPIC with Aadhaar:
The program sought to link the Elector’s Photo Identity Card (EPIC) data with the Aadhaar database to authenticate voter identities and eliminate duplicate entries in the electoral rolls.
Error Correction:
NERPAP aimed to facilitate the correction of errors in voter data and improve the overall quality of images on electoral documents.
Voluntary Disclosure of Multiple Entries:
Voters were encouraged to voluntarily disclose any multiple registrations, allowing for timely corrections and deletions of unnecessary entries from the electoral rolls.
Enhanced Communication:
The initiative also aimed to collect mobile numbers and email addresses from voters, enabling the Election Commission to provide important updates regarding elections, such as poll dates and revision schedules.
Public Participation:
To ensure maximum engagement, special camps and facilitation centers were organized nationwide to assist voters in linking their Aadhaar with EPIC and addressing any concerns regarding their registrations.
What did the Supreme Court mandate in the Puttaswamy case in 2018?
In the
, the Supreme Court recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution. It ruled that while Aadhaar could be used for various purposes, including voter registration, individuals cannot be denied their right to vote for failing to provide their Aadhaar number.
This ruling emphasized that any legal framework must respect individual privacy rights and ensure that no citizen is disenfranchised due to administrative requirements.
What are the pros and cons?
Pros:
Elimination of Duplicate Entries:
Linking Aadhaar with EPIC can help remove multiple registrations for individuals who may have registered in different locations due to migration.
Real-time Authentication:
The unique identity provided by Aadhaar enables online verification, enhancing the accuracy of voter rolls.
Updated Voter Database:
The initiative aims to maintain an updated and accurate record of voters, which is crucial for free and fair elections.
Cons:
Database Errors:
Errors within the Aadhaar database could lead to wrongful rejection or deletion of legitimate voter entries.
Proof of Citizenship Concerns:
Aadhaar serves as proof of residence but not citizenship, potentially failing to address non-citizen registrations on electoral rolls.
Privacy Risks:
While linkage may not directly violate privacy rights, there are concerns about misuse as electoral rolls are accessible to political parties.
What can be the way forward?
Transparent and Voluntary Process:
Modify electoral forms to clearly indicate that providing Aadhaar is voluntary, ensuring no voter is denied registration for not furnishing their Aadhaar number.
Strengthen Data Accuracy and Privacy Safeguards:
Establish mechanisms to verify Aadhaar data accuracy and implement robust data protection measures to prevent misuse of linked electoral rolls.
Mains PYQ:
Examine the scope of Fundamental Rights in the light of the latest judgement of the Supreme Court on Right to Privacy.

**********Is groundwater contamination high in India?
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related to water resources;
Why in the News?
The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) found that many states in India are facing a serious problem with high nitrate levels in groundwater.
What are the contaminants?
The assessment of India’s groundwater quality has identified several significant contaminants, primarily driven by agricultural practices, industrial activities, and natural geological factors. The key contaminants include:
Nitrates:
Excessive use of nitrogen-based fertilizers in agriculture leads to high levels of nitrates in groundwater. This is the most prevalent contaminant, with over 56% of India’s districts reporting nitrate levels exceeding the safe limit of 45 mg/l.
Fluoride:
Fluoride contamination is a major concern, particularly in states like Rajasthan, Haryana, and Karnataka. Approximately 9.04% of tested groundwater samples had fluoride levels above the permissible limit of 1.5 mg/l.
Arsenic:
Naturally occurring arsenic in certain geological formations poses serious health risks, particularly in alluvial plains where industrial activities may exacerbate contamination.
Uranium:
Elevated uranium levels have been detected in several regions, with about 6.60% of samples exceeding the safe limit of 30 ppb (parts per billion). States like Rajasthan and Punjab report significant uranium contamination.
Iron:
High concentrations of iron affect groundwater quality and can lead to aesthetic issues and potential health risks when consumed in large amounts.
Other Heavy Metals:
Contaminants such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and chromium are also present due to industrial discharges and improper waste management.
What was the state of groundwater in 2024?
Overall Extraction Rate:
The degree of groundwater extraction across the country was reported at approximately 60.4%, indicating that this level has remained relatively stable compared to previous years. This figure reflects the percentage of groundwater resources being utilized versus what is available for extraction.
Safe Blocks:
About 73% of groundwater blocks were categorized as ‘safe,’ meaning they are adequately replenished to meet extraction demands. This represents a slight increase from previous assessments.
Recharge and Availability:
Total annual groundwater recharge was noted to have decreased marginally from 449 BCM (Billion Cubic Meters) in 2023 to 446.90 BCM in 2024.
The annual extractable groundwater resources slightly declined from 407.21 BCM to 406.19 BCM.
Contamination Issues:
Despite improvements in some areas, challenges remain, particularly with nitrate contamination, where 440 districts were identified as having excessive nitrate levels in their groundwater.
How are groundwater levels measured?
Groundwater levels are measured using a network established by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), which includes:
Observation Wells:
Approximately 26,000 observation wells are used for manual measurements of groundwater levels.
Digital Monitoring:
Since 2023, around 16,000 to 17,000 piezometers equipped with digital recorders have been installed to automatically measure and transmit groundwater levels to a centralized system for real-time monitoring.
What happens if nitrate presence is high in groundwater?
Health Risks:
Elevated nitrate levels can cause methemoglobinemia, also known as “blue baby syndrome,” particularly in infants under six months old. This condition reduces the blood’s ability to carry oxygen, resulting in a bluish tint to the skin and potentially severe health complications if untreated.
Environmental Concerns:
Excessive nitrates contribute to algal blooms in surface water bodies, which can deplete oxygen levels, harm aquatic ecosystems, and disrupt the balance of marine life.
Way forward:
Sustainable Agricultural Practices
: Promote the use of organic fertilizers, precision farming techniques, and regulated use of nitrogen-based fertilizers to minimize nitrate leaching into groundwater.
Strengthened Monitoring and Remediation
: Expand digital groundwater monitoring networks, enforce strict industrial discharge regulations, and implement remediation techniques like bioremediation and constructed wetlands to mitigate contamination.
