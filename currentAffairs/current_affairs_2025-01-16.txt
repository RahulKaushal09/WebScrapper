How India Can Become the World’s Leading Startup Ecosystem
Context
India’s startup ecosystem has experienced a meteoric rise
, evolving from a nascent stage to becoming the
world’s third-largest hub for innovation
and entrepreneurship.
With over
1,30,000 recognised startups today, up from a mere 400 in 2015-16
, this remarkable growth underscores the country’s vibrant entrepreneurial spirit.
Central to this transformation
is India’s robust
digital public infrastructure, addressing global challenges such as financial inclusion, sustainable development
, and agricultural productivity.
An Assessment of Technological Opportunities and Government Initiatives
Strategic Government Missions
The
government has been proactive in creating this growth
through several strategic initiatives.
National Quantum Mission
aims to position India as a global leader in quantum computing by driving advancements in quantum communication, encryption, and computation.
This
initiative will enable breakthroughs in sectors like healthcare, cybersecurity,
and finance.
Similarly, the India AI Mission focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems,
such as improving healthcare accessibility, optimizing supply chains, and enhancing urban planning.
Semiconductor Mission, aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing, addresses the critical need for self-reliance
in this vital technology sector, especially in light of global supply chain vulnerabilities.
Commitment to Research and Development
government has allocated a substantial ₹1 lakh crore for research and development (R&D),
reflecting its commitment to fostering innovation.
funding not only supports academic research but also enables startups to explore pioneering technologies
, bridging the gap between conceptual research and market-ready solutions.
Progressive Policies
liberalisation of space exploration and geospatial technology has encouraged private players
to contribute to satellite launches, remote sensing, and space research.
This has
allowed startups like Skyroot Aerospace and Pixxel to emerge as key contributors to India’s space ambitions.
the government’s focus on drones, electric vehicles, and clean energy aligns with global trends toward sustainability
and energy efficiency.
Key Features of Indian Start-Up Ecosystem
Innovation, Intellectual Property
India produces approximately 24,000 PhD graduates annually,
driving advancements in science and engineering.
However,
the country paid $14.3 billion in intellectual property (IP) royalties in 2024 while earning only $1.5 billion,
highlighting a significant innovation gap.
Strengthening the intellectual property ecosystem is crucial
for fostering innovation and establishing India as a global hub.
Startups must lead this effort by contributing to advancements in technology
and intellectual property.
Expansion to Smaller Cities
growth of India’s startup ecosystem is no longer confined to metro citie
s like Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi.
Nearly 50% of startups now emerge from Tier II and Tier III cities,
including Indore, Jaipur, and Ahmedabad. With half of India’s urban population living in smaller cities, these regions hold immense potential.
Supporting these hubs with infrastructure, educational opportunities, and inclusivity — particularly by increasing women’s representation
in leadership roles — can unlock untapped talent and drive innovation.
An Analysis of Funding Challenges for Start-Ups
Access to Patient Capital in Deep Tech
While Indian startups have achieved remarkable growth,
those operating in deep tech sectors face a significant hurdle: access to patient capital.
Deep tech startups,
which focus on highly technical and research-intensive fields like quantum computing, AI, robotics, and biotech,
require long-term investments due to the prolonged development cycles of their products
and solutions.
Traditional venture capitalists and private equity investors often hesitate to fund these ventures
, as the returns are not immediate.
Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS), launched in 2016, has been instrumental
in addressing this issue to some extent.
By committing ₹11,688 crore across 151 Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), the FFS has catalysed a pool of ₹81,000 crore
, demonstrating a multiplier effect in the funding ecosystem.
Over-Reliance on Foreign Capital
One of the key challenges facing
India’s startup ecosystem is its heavy reliance on foreign funding.
In 2024, Indian startups raised over $12 billion
, but approximately
75% of this came from international sources.
While foreign capital has played a pivotal role in driving the growth of the ecosystem,
over-reliance on it poses risks, including vulnerability to global economic fluctuations and potential misalignment of long-term strategic goals.
The Way Forward to Address these Challenges
Incorporation of Ethical Practices and Self Regulations
India’s startup ecosystem thrives on minimal regulatory interference,
creating innovation and flexibility.
recent incidents of corporate mismanagement in prominent startups like Byju’s and BharatPe have raised concerns.
To address these issues,
startups must adopt self-regulation frameworks emphasizing accountability, transparency, and ethical conduct.
Mentorship, professional boards, and sound financial management are essential
for long-term stability.
Investors, particularly venture capitalists and angel investors, also play a crucial role
in ensuring governance and guiding startups toward sustainable growth.
Leveraging Domestic Institutional Capital
To address this over-reliance
, India must bolster its domestic funding ecosystem.
Large domestic institutions
such as insurance companies, pension funds, and
mutual funds hold significant untapped potential.
By allocating a portion of their surpluses to startups, these institutions can provide the long-term capital
needed to support innovation and growth.
approach also aligns with the broader national interest
, ensuring that the wealth generated from India’s burgeoning startup ecosystem benefits domestic stakeholders.
Creating a Resilient Domestic Funding Ecosystem
To ensure the sustainability of India’s startup ecosystem,
a resilient and diversified funding environment is essential.
Increasing domestic capital participation,
establishing specialized funds for high-risk ventures, and developing a culture of long-term investment will create a robust financial backbone for startups.
This will enable India to maintain its trajectory as a global innovation leader
, driving economic growth and technological advancement.
Need for a Dedicated Fund for Deep Tech
Despite the FFS's success,
there is a critical need for a specialized fund of funds exclusively for deep tech startups.
These
startups operate in domains that are high-risk yet high-reward,
often requiring extended periods of development before achieving profitability.
A dedicated fund would provide the patient capital necessary for these ventures to innovate without the immediate pressure
of financial returns.
Conclusion
India is well-positioned
to become the
world’s leading startup ecosystem.
Favourable policies, a thriving culture of innovation
, and collaborative efforts across sectors
provide the foundation
for scaling startups into global enterprises.
As India works towards its vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047,
startups will play a pivotal role in driving economic growth, creating jobs, and positioning the country as a leader in innovation.

Editorial Analysis
**********What is a Mud Volcano?
A mud volcano eruption in the Caspian Sea created a temporary 'ghost island' in early 2023, only for it to erode away by the end of 2024.
About Mud Volcano:
It is a small volcano-shaped cone of mud and clay, of height usually less than a few meters and often a few decimeters.
The craters are usually shallow and may intermittently erupt mud.
These eruptions continuously rebuild the cones, which are eroded relatively easily.
Some mud volcanoes are created by hot spring activity where large amounts of gas and small amounts of water react chemically with the surrounding rocks and form boiling mud.
Variations are the porridge pot (a basin of boiling mud that erodes chunks of the surrounding rock) and the paint pot (a basin of boiling mud that is tinted yellow, green, or blue by minerals from the surrounding rocks).
Other mud volcanoes, entirely of a nonigneous origin, occur only in oil-field regions that are relatively young and have soft, unconsolidated formations.
Under compactional stress, methane and related hydrocarbon gases mixed with mud force their way upward and burst through to the surface, spewing mud into a conelike shape.
Because of the compactional stress and the depth from which the mixture comes, the mud is often hot and may have an accompanying steam cloud.
Mud volcanoes are not real volcanoes and are not as hazardous as real volcanoes since they can only emit warm mud and only very locally (a few hundred meters around them).
The largest mud volcanoes actually do pose hazards, but not of the usual volcanic kind. Instead, the sheer volume of mud erupted can flood the landscape, displace people, and bury infrastructure and agriculture.
Approximately 1,000 mud volcanoes have been identified on land and in shallow water.
In Europe and Asia, mud volcanoes are known to exist in southeastern Ukraine, Italy, Romania, Azerbaijan, Iran, Pakistan, Indonesia, and China.
In North and South America, mud volcanoes have been documented in Alaska, California, the Island of Trinidad, Venezuela, and Colombia.

**********What is Kokborok Language?
The Twipra Student Federation (TSF), a wing of the North East Students Organisation (NESO), staged a protest in Agartala recently, demanding the adoption of the Roman script for the Kokborok language.
About Kokborok Language:
Kokborok is a language of the Borok people, geographically known as Tripuris.
It is one of the State’s official languages of Tripura, notified on January 19, 1979.
It is a Sino-Tibetan language and can be traced back to at least the 1st century AD when the historical record of Tripuri kings started to be written down in a book called the Raj Ratnakar.
So far, the term Kokborok is known to first occur as ‘Kok-boro’ in 1897/98 in an early primer on the language, Daulat Ahmed ‘Kokboroma.
In 1900, Thakur Radhamohan Debbarma spelt ‘Kokborok’ in a published grammar of the language.
At the time, various British Political Agents, District Officers, Sub- Division Officers were known as linguists – they called this language Tipperh, Tipura, or Tipra Language.
The word Kokborok is derived from the word ‘Kok’, meaning ‘verbal’, and ‘Borok’, meaning ‘people’ or ‘human’.
According to the 2011 Census report, the number of Kokborok-speaking people is 8,80,537, which is 23.97% of the total population of Tripura.

**********What is Blood Money?
The death sentence awarded by a Yemen court to a nurse from Kerala, and the subsequent debates and efforts surrounding her acquittal and repatriation, which involves monetary compensation paid to the victim’s family, have brought the focus back on ‘blood money’ and its implications.
About Blood Money:
Blood money’, or ‘diya’, finds footing in the Islamic Sharia law and is followed in countries that incorporate these laws in their legislation.
Under the rule of ‘diya’, a select quantity of a valuable asset, primarily monetary, has to be paid by the perpetrator of the crime to the victim or the victim’s family if the latter has died.
The custom is practised predominantly in cases involving unintentional murder and culpable homicide.
It is also invoked in murder cases wherein the victim’s kin choose not to retaliate through ‘qisas’ (a way of retribution under the Sharia).
The end-goal, as the law says, is not to put a price tag on human life but to alleviate the plight and suffering of the affected family and their potential loss of income.
However, it is to be noted that even if the concerned parties reconcile through ‘blood money’, the community and the state will retain the right to impose a deterrent punishment, including penalties.
In its contemporary applications, ‘blood money’ is upheld in several Islamic countries with factors such as gender, religion, and nationality of the victim coming into play.
In Saudi Arabia, for instance, the traffic regulations specifically mandate payment of ‘blood money’ to heirs of the victims who die in road accidents. In addition, the perpetrator shall be liable to a prison term.
What’s India’s stand on ‘diya’?
Provisions for the grant or receiving of ‘blood money’ do not find a place in India’s formal legal system.
However, the system does provide a way for the accused to negotiate with the prosecution through ‘plea bargaining’.
Though the concept cannot be directly equated with ‘blood money’, the scheme lays out a procedure whereby the defendant agrees to plead guilty for a particular offence perpetrated by the accused in return for a concession from the prosecutor.
Introduced through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2005, plea bargaining comes with an array of limitations unlike ‘blood money’, which has a broader purview.
For instance, plea bargaining can be taken up only for offences that are penalised with imprisonment of less than seven years.
It cannot be invoked if the accused has been previously convicted for a similar offence.
Besides, the provision is not available for crimes against women or children aged below 14; heinous crimes such as murder or rape; and offences involving socio-economic conditions, including civil rights.
Moreover, the accused has to voluntarily come forward to plead guilty, and must not be coerced.
However, on the lines of ‘blood money’, plea bargaining may also allow for the victim to receive compensation.

**********Hydroclimate Whiplash
According to a study by climate attribution group ClimaMeter, three wildfires that have devastated large parts of the Los Angeles city is mainly due to a ‘hydroclimate whiplash’.
About Hydroclimate Whiplash:
It is rare meteorological condition wherein an extremely wet season is succeeded by an extremely dry season.
How it occurs?
It’s kind of this paradox that as the atmosphere gets warmer, both the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere can increase, and the deficit of water vapour in the atmosphere can also increase exponentially.
Consequently, as the atmosphere warms, it is able to hold much more water – for a longer period – before it is eventually released as precipitation.
It is this relationship between global warming and the atmosphere which leads to the extended periods of dry spells and more intense rainfall when it eventually occurs.
Impacts:
Increases number of droughts and floods.
Fires created by the dry condition exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular diseases through their polluting smoke.
Human health: Flooding creates conditions for waterborne illnesses such as cholera, leptospirosis
Such ‘hydroclimate whiplash’ conditions have increased by 31-66 per cent in three-month periods (sub-seasonal) and by 8-31 per cent in 12-month periods (inter-annual) across the world since the middle of the 20th century.

**********Growing Plants in Space: The Future of Sustenance Beyond Earth
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, Growing Crops in Plants, Challenges)
Space Farming (Techniques, ISRO’s experiment, Significance of Space Farming, etc.)
Introduction:
ISRO achieved a significant milestone by successfully germinating lobia (black-eyed pea) seeds in space as part of its
Compact Research Module for Orbital Plant Studies (CROPS)
This development highlights the importance of cultivating plants in extra-terrestrial environments, paving the way for sustainable life on celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars.
Why Grow Plants in Space?
As space missions extend over years, traditional food supplies fall short due to their limited shelf life and nutritional degradation over time.
Growing plants in space addresses these challenges by:
Sustaining Food Supply
: Plants provide a renewable source of nutrition.
Oxygen Production
: Photosynthesis in plants releases oxygen, making the air aboard spacecraft breathable.
Recycling Systems
: Plants create a closed-loop system by recycling carbon dioxide and organic waste.
Mental Health Benefits
: Tending to plants helps reduce stress and enhances astronauts' overall well-being.
Challenges of Growing Plants in Space:
Growing plants in space presents several obstacles, primarily due to the microgravity environment:
Root Growth and Water Delivery
In microgravity, roots lack the directional pull of gravity and fail to grow downward.
Water clings to surfaces rather than reaching the roots, complicating nutrient absorption.
Radiation and Temperature Fluctuations
High levels of radiation can damage plant DNA and hinder growth.
Extreme temperature variations in space require insulation to protect plants.
Light Limitations
In regions of low sunlight, photosynthesis is disrupted, reducing oxygen production.
Techniques for Space Farming:
Scientists have developed innovative methods to grow plants in space:
Hydroponics
: Uses liquid solutions to deliver water and nutrients directly to plants, eliminating the need for soil.
Aeroponics
: Plants grow with their roots suspended in air, using mist for nutrient delivery. This method reduces water and fertiliser usage while eliminating the need for pesticides.
Soil-like Media
: Mimics terrestrial soil to support plant growth, often supplemented with slow-release fertilisers.
‘Veggie’ system
aboard the International Space Station (ISS), a space garden about the size of a carry-on bag, exemplifies these approaches.
ISRO’s Experiment with Lobia:
ISRO’s CROPS module functioned as a miniature greenhouse, simulating Earth-like conditions in space:
Medium
: Highly porous clay pellets were used, retaining water and providing nutrients via slow-release fertilisers.
: Eight LEDs (four warm, four cool) simulated a 16-hour day and an 8-hour night for photosynthesis.
Temperature and Atmosphere
: Conditions were regulated between 20–30°C, with Earth-like air composition.
: An electric valve controlled from Earth injected water into the soil-like medium.
The seeds germinated on the fourth day, with leaves emerging a day later, demonstrating the success of the experiment.
Ideal Space Crops:
Plants are chosen based on their growth efficiency, nutrient content, and adaptability to confined environments. Common space crops include:
Leafy Greens
: Lettuce, spinach, and kale grow quickly and are nutrient-dense.
Beans and Peas
: Protein-rich and capable of fixing nitrogen in the medium.
Root Vegetables
: Radishes and carrots thrive in compact spaces.
Grains
: Wheat and rice are essential for long-term sustenance.
Fruits
: Tomatoes and strawberries offer a sweet, nutritious addition to space diets.
Significance of Space Farming:
Cultivating plants in space is a cornerstone of future interplanetary missions.
By providing fresh food, recycling resources, and enhancing mental health, space-grown crops contribute to the sustainability of long-term extra-terrestrial habitats.
Advances like ISRO’s CROPS experiment underscore India’s growing expertise in this critical field.
Conclusion:
The successful growth of lobia seeds in ISRO’s space module is a step forward in addressing the challenges of space farming.
As humans prepare for extended missions and the colonisation of other planets, innovations in space agriculture will play a pivotal role in ensuring sustainability and self-sufficiency beyond Earth.

**********New US AI export rule excludes India from benefits of closest allies
Why in news?
The Joe Biden administration, days before leaving office, introduced a regulatory framework titled ‘Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion’ that categorizes countries into three tiers for AI hardware export restrictions. The first tier includes 18 close US allies with minimal restrictions, while the third tier severely restricts exports to countries of concern.
The rules aim to maintain US control over advanced AI chips and models, but their enforcement will depend on the incoming Trump administration.
What’s in today’s article
Three-Tier Framework for AI Hardware Export Restrictions
Special Provision for India and China
Why did the US impose these caps?
Potential Impact on India
Nvidia’s Criticism of the AI Diffusion Rules
Tier 1: Closest US Allies
Includes 18 countries like Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the UK.
No restrictions on computing power deployment by US companies.
Security requirements are minimal.
Tier 2: Majority of Countries, Including India
Most countries fall in this category, including India.
Limited to importing around 50,000 advanced AI chips through 2027, which could double with a US agreement.
India is placed in the middle tier, facing some limitations on importing GPUs, potentially impacting its plan to acquire 10,000 GPUs for the IndiaAI Mission.
Large AI data centers could face challenges, but smaller firms remain unaffected.
Tier 3: Restricted Countries
(severely restricts exports to countries of concern)
Includes nations like Russia, China, North Korea, and Libya.
Export of US AI technology to these countries is nearly prohibited.
The law also envisions a special review called the
General Validated End User
This list includes only two countries: India and China
India:
Indian companies that get this authorisation can use the exported items for civilian & military purposes, but not for nuclear use.
China:
Chinese companies with this authorisation can only use the technology for civilian use.
To prevent adversaries like China, Iran, and Russia from accessing advanced AI technologies.
To build a trusted technology ecosystem while addressing national security risks.
The policy aims to protect US technological leadership without stifling innovation.
Short-term Impact:
Experts feel that India’s initial plan to procure 10,000 GPUs for the ₹10,000-crore IndiaAI Mission is unlikely to be affected.
Subsidised GPUs will be provided to startups, academia, and researchers for training AI models.
Long-term Concerns:
Licensing uncertainties and trade negotiations may challenge large-scale AI deployments.
Companies like Reliance and Yotta, aiming to build AI compute infrastructure, could face delays.
Scaling up AI data centers requiring several hundred thousand GPUs may become difficult.
India’s Response and Options
Current demand can be fulfilled, but future scaling may require reassessment of restrictions by the incoming Trump administration.
India could secure General National Validated End User authorisations due to its non-re-exporter status and support from Nvidia and AMD.
The country’s AI market is projected to grow to $17 billion by 2027 at an annual rate of 25%-35%.
Nvidia, dominating the AI GPU market, criticized the Biden administration’s new AI diffusion rules as:
Overreaching and Bureaucratic
: Described the 200+ page regulatory framework as excessive, secretive, and lacking proper legislative review.
Harming US Competitiveness
: Claimed the rules impose unnecessary controls over semiconductor and software design and marketing, weakening US innovation and global leadership.
Contrasting Trump’s Approach
: Praised the first Trump administration for fostering AI growth through industry competition without compromising national security, contrasting it with Biden's policies.
Nvidia suggested the new rules would hinder innovation rather than mitigate any threats.

**********Does ‘blood money’ have a legal standing?
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to crime;
Why in the News?
The death sentence given to Kerala nurse
Nimisha Priy
a in Yemen for murdering her partner has sparked debates on her
acquittal, repatriation
, and the r
ole of ‘
‘ compensation
.
What does ‘blood money’ mean?
‘Blood money’,
known as
‘diya/diyah
‘ (in Arabic), refers to the financial compensation paid to the victim or their heirs in cases of murder, bodily harm, or property damage under Islamic law. It serves as an alternative to the principle of
qisas
, which allows for retribution.
The concept aims to promote forgiveness and reconciliation while providing reparative justice to the victim’s family, preventing cycles of vengeance that could lead to further conflict.
How does it figure in Islamic Sharia law?
Definition and Purpose:
In Islamic Sharia law,
(blood money) is the financial compensation paid to the victim or their heirs in cases of murder, bodily harm, or property damage caused unintentionally.
(retaliation), allowing the victim’s family to choose between seeking retribution or accepting compensation, thereby promoting forgiveness and reconciliation within the community.
Legal Framework:
The amount of
is typically determined through negotiation and varies based on factors such as the victim’s gender and religion.
In traditional Islamic law, homicide is treated as a civil matter between individuals rather than solely a state issue, with the victim or their heirs having significant authority in deciding the resolution.
What’s India’s stand on ‘diya’?
The Indian legal system
does not incorporate ‘diyah’
as a means of compensation for victims or their families. Instead, it emphasizes formal legal proceedings and criminal justice processes without the option for monetary compensation in cases of homicide or serious offenses.
Introduced through the
Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2005
, plea bargaining allows for some level of negotiation between the accused and the prosecution, enabling victims to receive compensation under specific conditions.
However, this process is limited to certain offenses and does not encompass the broader cultural and social implications associated with
in Islamic law.
Have there been other Indians who were pardoned with ‘blood money’?
Yes, there have been several instances involving Indian nationals who were pardoned through the payment of blood money.
Ten Indians in UAE (2017):
In this case, ten Indian nationals were forgiven by the victim’s family after a
payment of 200,000 dirhams was made.
Seventeen Indians in UAE (2009):
These individuals were on death row for the murder of a Pakistani national but were pardoned after a
amounting to nearly ₹4 crore was paid. The Indian consulate actively participated by hiring a law firm to advocate for their case.
Way forward:
Strengthen Diplomatic Interventions
: The Indian government should establish dedicated legal aid and consular support mechanisms to negotiate and facilitate the resolution of cases involving citizens abroad, ensuring transparency in blood money arrangements.
Promote International Legal Awareness
: Educate Indian expatriates on local laws and the implications of blood money practices in host countries to prevent legal entanglements and ensure better compliance with local regulations.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the possible factors that inhibit India from enacting for its citizen a uniform civil code as provided for in the Directive Principles of State Policy.

**********No, legal guarantee for MSP is not a “folly”
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues and benefits related to MSP;
Why in the News?
There is an ongoing heated discussion about whether farmers should be given a legal guarantee for
Minimum Support Price (MSP).
Is a legal guarantee for MSP feasible within India’s economic framework?
The arguments in favour of the legalisation of MSP:
Protects Farmers from Market Fluctuations:
Farmers often face volatile market prices due to surplus production, inadequate infrastructure, or global competition. A legal guarantee for MSP ensures a minimum income and shields them from sudden price crashes.
Example:
Crops like onions and tomatoes frequently see price collapses that leave farmers unable to cover costs.
Addresses Rural Distress and Ensures Livelihood Security:
A guaranteed MSP provides a reliable source of income, reducing poverty and addressing the rural distress that drives issues like farmer suicides.
In drought-prone regions, assured MSP acts as a safety net against the dual impacts of climate change and market failures.
Supports National Food Security:
Incentivizing farmers through a guaranteed MSP ensures the continued production of essential crops, securing food for the nation and stabilizing food prices for consumers.
Government procurement of rice and wheat at MSP forms the backbone of the Public Distribution System (PDS), ensuring affordable food for millions.
The arguments against the legalisation of MSP:
Risk of Market Distortions:
A legally enforced MSP could disrupt natural price discovery, discouraging private investment in agriculture and creating inefficiencies in the market.
Guaranteed MSP could encourage overproduction of certain crops, leading to supply gluts and environmental degradation.
Unsustainable Fiscal Burden:
Implementing MSP for a wide range of crops would require massive public expenditure, diverting resources from other developmental priorities like healthcare and education.
What mechanisms can ensure farmers receive the MSP without direct government purchases?
Widening Food Basket:
Expanding the food basket in the Public Distribution System (PDS) and increasing procurement levels at MSP can help ensure farmers receive fair prices without direct purchases.
Market Intervention Schemes:
Establishing targeted market intervention schemes can prevent prices from falling below the MSP, thus providing farmers with necessary price support.
Price Deficit Payment (PDP):
A legally mandated compensation mechanism for farmers when market prices fall below the MSP could be implemented. This would not require direct procurement but would ensure farmers are compensated based on official data regarding area sown and average productivity.
What are the broader implications of a legal MSP guarantee on agricultural policy and farmer welfare?
Social Contract:
The demand for a legally guaranteed MSP reflects an unwritten social contract between the Indian state and farmers. Breaching this contract could lead to further disenfranchisement of farmers facing challenges like climate change and global competition.
Market Dynamics:
A legal guarantee could alter market dynamics by ensuring that farmers are not solely dependent on volatile market conditions. This might encourage more stable agricultural production and investment in rural areas.
Political Considerations:
Given the electoral implications of food prices in a democracy, a legally guaranteed MSP could compel governments to prioritise farmer welfare over consumer price suppression, potentially leading to more balanced agricultural policies.
Way forward:
Strengthen Decentralized Procurement and PDP Mechanisms:
Expand the food basket under PDS and introduce
schemes to ensure farmers receive MSP without burdening government finances through direct procurement. This would also reduce inefficiencies in distribution.
Promote Diversification and Agri-Infrastructure:
Encourage crop diversification by linking MSP with environmentally sustainable and high-value crops, supported by improved storage, transportation, and market access to minimize post-harvest losses and enhance farmer incomes sustainably.
Mains PYQ:
What do you mean by Minimum Support Price (MSP)? How will MSP rescue the farmers from the low-income trap?

**********Why have we normalised hate speech against women in politics?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges to women empowerment; Women Representation in Politics;
Why in the News?
The
267th Law Commission Report
that was recently released, recommended including “
hate speech”
within the
Indian Penal Code,
indicating a governmental acknowledgment of the need to address this pervasive issue.
This has reignited conversations about the legal framework surrounding hate speech,
particularly against women in politics.
Key Highlights made by the 267th Law Commission Report
Definition and Scope of Hate Speech:
The report begins by providing a comprehensive definition of hate speech, emphasizing its potential to incite violence, discrimination, and social discord. It
categorizes hate speech
as any communication that demeans or vilifies individuals based on attributes such as religion, caste, gender, or ethnicity.
Proposed Legal Provisions:
One of the report’s central recommendations is the amendment of the
Indian Penal Code (IPC)
and also suggests penalties that reflect the severity of the offense, thereby reinforcing the message that hate speech will not be tolerated in a democratic society.
Protection of Minority Communities:
The commission advocates for legal safeguards that ensure minority communities are not disproportionately targeted within public discourse. By highlighting the vulnerabilities faced by minorities, the report calls for a proactive approach to uphold their rights and dignity in the face of societal prejudice.
Balancing Free Speech and Protection:
The commission emphasizes that while
free speech is a fundamental right
, it should not come at the expense of public order or individual safety. The proposed laws aim to delineate clear boundaries that prevent hate speech without infringing upon legitimate expressions of opinion or dissent.
Public Awareness Campaigns:
The report additionally recommends launching extensive public awareness campaigns aimed at educating citizens about the harmful consequences of hate speech.
What factors contribute to the normalization of hate speech against women in politics?
Cultural Attitudes:
Misogynistic remarks are often rooted in deep-seated cultural attitudes that devalue women, reflecting a broader societal acceptance of gender discrimination and objectification.
Political Discourse:
Political speeches frequently employ derogatory language towards women, which normalizes such behaviour and diminishes the seriousness of misogyny in public life.
Lack of Accountability:
Political parties often distance themselves from offensive remarks only after public backlash, leading to a culture where such comments are tolerated until they provoke outrage.
Note:
The word
“misogyny”
comes from Greek roots: “misein,” which means “to hate,” and “gyne,” which means “woman.” Misogyny can show up in various ways, such as male privilege, discrimination against women, sexual harassment, insulting or demeaning women, violence, and treating women as objects.
How does hate speech impact women’s participation in politics?
Discouragement and Marginalization:
Hate speech creates an intimidating environment for women, discouraging them from participating in politics and undermining their credibility as leaders.
Social Isolation:
The prevalence of hostile commentary can isolate women politicians, making it difficult for them to connect with constituents and build supportive networks.
Psychological Effects:
Constant exposure to misogynistic remarks can lead to emotional distress, affecting women’s confidence and willingness to engage in political activities.
How are Panchayats playing a good field in building awareness?
Women Representation:
Nearly 20 states have achieved 50% representation of women in Panchayati Raj institutions, fostering an environment where women’s voices are amplified in local governance.
Empowerment Initiatives:
There has been an emergence of all-women panchayats like ‘
Manje Rai Panchayat’
in Ahmednagar district of
Maharashtra
and ‘
Kultikri Gram Panchayat’
under Jhargram sub-division in
West Bengal.
For example, the political women leaders like
Mamta Devi
exemplify effective governance by addressing infrastructure, and livelihood issues, and mobilizing women within their communities.
What are the key recommendations from the Global Gender Gap 2023 Report?
Women in local governance’
have been added as an indicator in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Report
India is ranked quite low at 127/146).
The report emphasizes the
urgent need for legal recognition
of gender-based hate speech. This entails developing laws that specifically address and
penalize hate speech
directed at women.
The report calls for
enhanced accountability and commitment
towards gender equality, not just through government schemes but as a fundamental aspect of
political culture
Way forward:
Strengthen Legal Frameworks
: Enact comprehensive hate speech laws that explicitly address gender-based discrimination and ensure accountability for misogynistic remarks in politics, alongside implementing the recommendations of the 267th Law Commission Report.
Promote Women-Centric Governance
: Encourage greater representation of women in all levels of governance, drawing inspiration from successful initiatives in Panchayati Raj institutions, while supporting leadership training and public awareness campaigns to combat societal biases.
Mains PYQ:
“Though women in post-independent India have excelled in various fields, the social attitude towards women and the feminist movement has been patriarchal.” Apart from women’s education and women empowerment schemes, what interventions can help change this milieu?
