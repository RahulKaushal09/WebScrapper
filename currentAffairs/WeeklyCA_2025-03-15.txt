Seagrass Conservation
Source: DTE
Why in News?
A study in
Nature
reports that
seagrasses
are declining
at a rate of 1–2% annually,
with nearly
5%
of species endangered due to human activities, highlighting the
need to protect 30%
of seagrass by
2030
to preserve biodiversity.
What are Seagrasses?
About:
Seagrasses are
submerged, flowering marine aquatic plants
that grow in
shallow coastal waters
such as
bays
and
lagoons
They possess small flowers and strap-like or oval leaves, forming dense underwater meadows.
Classification:
Seagrasses belong to the order
Alismatales
and are classified into
4 families with around 60 species
Some of the important seagrasses are
Sea Cow Grass
(Cymodocea serrulata)
Thready Seagrass
(Cymodocea rotundata)
Needle Seagrass
(Syringodium isoetifolium)
Flat-tipped Seagrass
Halodule uninervis
), etc.
Key Features:
Like terrestrial plants, seagrasses conduct
photosynthesis
support marine biodiversity
enhance oceanic oxygen levels.
reproduce both sexually and asexually
In
sexual reproduction
, submarine
pollination transfers male pollen to female flowers underwater.
Asexually, they
propagate through rhizomes-horizontal underground stems,
that enable regeneration after disturbances like grazing or storms.
Threats to Seagrass:
Pollution:
Industrial, agricultural, and urban waste degrade seagrass meadows.
Coastal Development:
Tourism and infrastructure projects disturb fragile ecosystems.
Climate Change:
Rising temperatures and ocean acidification threaten seagrass survival.
Weak Enforcement:
Despite existing laws, conservation efforts lack strict implementation.

What is the Significance of Seagrasses?
Carbon Sequestration:
store 11% of oceanic organic carbon
absorb 83 million tonnes of atmospheric carbon
sequestering carbon 35 times faster
than rainforests.
Biodiversity Hotspot:
It supports marine species, including
dugongs (sea cow)
and green turtles
, and sustains commercially important species like
squids and cuttlefish.
Ecological Importance:
Seagrass meadows support
750 fish species
121 threatened marine species
, green turtles, squids
These ecosystems contribute to
20% of global fishery landings
Coastal Protection:
improve water clarity
trapping sediments, filter land-based pollutants
prevent coastal erosion
by stabilizing the seabed with their root systems.
Livelihoods & Fisheries:
Seagrasses provide
safe breeding grounds for juvenile fish
shield marine organisms from strong currents and predators
, supporting ecosystems essential for
fisheries and global food security.

Way Forward
Integration into Policy Framework
: Seagrass conservation should be
incorporated into
India’s
National Biodiversity Action Plan
, ensuring
policy support, funding, and sustainable management practices.
Expansion of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)
: MPAs should be
expanded beyond 2.5% of India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
to protect and restore seagrass ecosystems.
Recognition in Climate Strategy:
Seagrass should be recognized in
India’s Blue Carbon Initiative
support climate commitments
carbon neutrality goals.
Assessment and Global Cooperation:
Global cooperation is vital as seagrasses
aid climate mitigation through carbon sequestration,
coastal protection, and biodiversity conservation. The
IUCN
assess their status for early intervention,
preventing extinction and enhancing conservation efforts.
Drishti Mains Question:
Discuss the ecological significance of seagrass meadows and the challenges they face due to human activities. Suggest measures for their conservation in India.
