STURGEONS
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
According to a new report, poaching and trafficking are endangering the survival of four sturgeon species in one of their last strongholds—the lower Danube River in southeastern Europe. These species are among the most endangered fish globally.
Sturgeons are iconic fish of ancient origin, present already in the time of dinosaurs. They award a cultural, economic and natural value to many rivers of the Northern hemisphere and have become symbols for healthy and free flowing river systems.
About Sturgeons
Ancient Origins: Sturgeons have been around for millions of years, with fossils dating back to the Late Cretaceous period.
Primitive Fish: They are considered “primitive” because they have retained many characteristics from their early ancestors.

Physical Characteristics
Distinctive Features: Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to those of sharks, and an elongated, spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless, and armored with lateral rows of bony plates called scutes.
Size: Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging from 2 to 3.5 meters in length.
Habitat and Behavior
Habitat: Sturgeons are found in subtropical, temperate, and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes, and coastlines of Eurasia and North America.
Migratory Patterns: Many sturgeon species are anadromous, meaning they migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives in river deltas and estuaries.
Additional Information
Sturgeons are heavily exploited globally for their roe/eggs (caviar) and meat. This has led to a steep decline in populations worldwide.
Due to overfishing for their roe (caviar) and habitat destruction, most sturgeon species are critically endangered
Since 1998, international trade in all species of sturgeons has been regulated under CITES owing to concerns over the impact of unsustainable harvesting of and illegal trade in sturgeon populations in the wild.

Mains – GS 2
: The Karnataka High Court has quashed proceedings under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act against a 23-year-old accused after he married the alleged victim in the case, with the caveat that the proceedings can be revived if he abandons the victim and their child.
The incident occurred on February 2, 2023, when the accused took the school-going girl to an isolated location and allegedly sexually assaulted her.The girl subsequently gave birth to their child. Both parties’ — accused and victim — through their legal representatives submitted that they were in love, but faced parental opposition.
About Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act
It aims to address offences of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children, which were either not specifically defined or adequately penalised.
It was enacted as a consequence of India’s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1992.
Key features of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act:
It is a gender-neutral legislation as it defines a child as “any person” under the age of 18.
It considers non-reporting a crime so any person in charge of an institution (excluding children) who fails to report the commission of a sexual offense involving a subordinate, faces punishment.
It does not specify any time limit for reporting abuse so a victim may report an offence at any time, even years after the abuse has occurred.
It keeps the victim’s identity confidential as the Act forbids the disclosure of the victim’s identity in any form of media unless authorized by the special courts established by the Act.
Key Provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act:
It defines a child as any person below the age of 18 years. The Act provides punishment as per the gravity of the offence.
It mandates that investigation in the cases is to be completed in two months (from the date of registration of FIR) and trial in six months.
It states a sexual assault is to be considered aggravated if – the abused child is mentally ill or, when the abuse is committed by a member of the armed forces or security forces, a public servant, or a person in a position of trust or authority of the child, like a family member, police officer, teacher, or doctor or a person-management or staff of a hospital, whether Government or private.
It prescribes rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life and also a fine as punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault.
It makes provisions for avoiding the re-victimization of the child at the hands of the judicial system. It makes it mandatory to report such cases as it makes it the legal duty of a person aware of the offence to report the sexual abuse. In case he fails to do so, the person can be punished with six months’ imprisonment or a fine.
It prescribes punishment to the people who traffic children for sexual purposes.
It provides for punishment against false complaints or untrue information.
It was amended in 2019 to increase the minimum punishment from seven years to ten years. It further adds that if a person commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below the age of 16 years, he will be punished with imprisonment between 20 years to life, with a fine.

**********The Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill 2024
Why in News?
The Union Ministry of Home Affairs introduced the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill 2024, in the Lok Sabha.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Need for the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill 2024
About the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill 2024
Criticism of the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill 2024
Govt’s Clarification on the DM (Amendment) Bill 2024 and Way Ahead
Need for the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill 2024:
There was a need to amend the
Disaster Management Act (DMA) 2005
The main purpose of the DMA
was to put in place necessary institutional mechanisms –
For drawing up and monitoring the implementation of disaster management plans,
Ensuring measures by various wings of Government for prevention of and mitigating the effects of disasters and
For undertaking a holistic, coordinated and prompt response to any disaster or threatening disaster situation.
To achieve this purpose,
certain Authorities and Committees
were established at the national level, state level and district level.
The Act has been reviewed
learnings from past disasters and experience
and in consultation with all stakeholders including State governments.
The Bill seeks
to mainstream disaster management in the development plans
, aligning with the recommendations of the
15th Finance Commission
Salient provisions of the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill 2024:
Defines disaster management:
Disaster management is
inclusive of disaster risk reduction
- the practice of reducing disaster risk through systematic effort.
This is to analyse and manage the causal facts of disaster through -
Reduced exposure to hazard;
Reduced vulnerability of people, property, infrastructure, economic activity, environmental and natural resource; and
Improved preparedness, resilience and capacity to manage and respond to adverse events.
Disaster database at national and State level:
The database will include -
Disaster assessment,
Fund allocation detail,
Expenditure,
Preparedness and mitigation plan,
Risk registers according to type and severity of risk, etc.
Constitution of UDMA:
The Bill provides for the Urban Disaster Management Authority (UDMA)
for State capitals and large cities
having municipal corporations, except the UTs of Delhi and Chandigarh.
State Disaster Response Force
: It provides for the constitution of the State Disaster Response Force by the State government.
Empowers the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA):
To take stock of the entire range of disaster risks in the country periodically, including emerging disaster risks, which include -
Risks of those disasters that may not have taken place, but may occur in future due to extreme climate events.
Empowers the NDMA and the State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs):
To prepare the disaster plan at national level and State level respectively instead of the plans made by the National Executive Committee and the State Executive Committees earlier.
Provides statutory status to certain organisations:
The Bill also provides statutory status to certain pre-Act organisations like the National Crisis Management Committee and the High-Level Committee.
Empower the Central and State governments:
To direct any person to take any action or refrain from taking any action for reducing the impact of a disaster and to impose a penalty not exceeding ₹10,000.
Significance of the Bill:
It aims to bring
more clarity and convergence
in the roles of authorities and committees working in the field of disaster management.
This is relevant in the context of the recent
Wayanad tragedy
, as there is a conflict between the Kerala government and the Union Home Ministry regarding early warning, due to multiplicity of authority.
This initiative marks a transformative step
toward enhancing the nation's capacity for disaster risk reduction and environmental sustainability.
A comprehensive, centralised disaster database
at both national and state levels will significantly build resilient communities by improving their ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters.
The creation of this disaster database will facilitate
more efficient resource allocation, better coordination among stakeholders, and timely, informed decision-making during crises
Criticism of the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill 2024:
Creates several authorities:
Multiplicity of authority will give rise to confusion and the bureaucratic/ procedural mess may hamper rescue and relief work
Encroaches upon the functions of the State governments:
The Bill grants excessive rulemaking power to the Central government through delegated legislation, which could potentially overlap with the legislative powers reserved for the States.
Such an overlap and the legislative competence of the Lok Sabha may encroach upon the domain of State legislatures.
Govt’s Clarification on the DM (Amendment) Bill 2024 and Way Ahead:
Govt’s clarification:
The Bill was being introduced under Entry 23 in the
Concurrent List
(“social security and social insurance, emplaned unemployment”) and the Bill followed a report by a task force in 2013.
Way forward:
An examination of the Bill is required to prevent any potential conflicts with the federal structure of our nation.

**********After import duty cut on gold, govt. to decide future of SGB scheme
Why in news?
Following the Budget announcement to cut the import duty on gold, the government plans to make a final decision regarding the future of the Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) scheme in September.
What’s in today’s article?
India’s Gold Market
Impact of Gold on the Economy
Import Duty Cut on Gold
Sovereign Gold Bonds Scheme (SGBS)
Govt to decide future of SGB scheme in September
The data on gold industry in terms of its’ size, direct contribution to GDP and employment, is not easily available.
However, as per the World Gold Council report 2024:
India, along with China, topped the global demand for gold jewellery in 2023. Despite record gold prices, demand for jewellery remained strong in India.
Overall, gold demand in 2023 was 747.5 tonnes, down 3 per cent from 774.1 tonnes.
India remains the
second largest gold jewellery consumer in the world.
India's central bank continued to be a significant buyer of gold, contributing to the global trend of substantial central bank gold purchases in 2023.
Business/employment opportunities:
Gold is used as a raw material for jewellery fabrication and making coins. This in turn creates business opportunities, value addition and employment.
The industry provides employment to a significant number of people in India, including miners, artisans, and retailers.
Current account deficit (CAD)
India is the world's second-largest importer of gold, which contributes to the country's current account deficit.
The import of gold requires foreign currency, which puts pressure on the country's foreign exchange reserves.
It should be noted that the gold imports are also used for export of gold jewellery,
it has the potential to mitigate the adverse impact of imports on CAD
Inflation:
Gold is often used as a hedge against inflation, which means that during times of high inflation, demand for gold increases.
This can lead to an increase in the price of gold, which can contribute to inflation.
Savings and investments
Gold is considered a safe-haven asset and a store of value in India, which means that many people use it as a means of savings and investment.
In Budget 2024-25, the government slashed import duties on gold to 6 per cent from 15 per cent.
While this duty cut led to a decrease in gold prices, it also resulted in increased demand for the metal.
The duty cut brought down domestic prices of gold last week to Rs 67,500 per 10 grams, their lowest in four months, from a record high of Rs 74,777 in early July 2024.
Some analysts believe the
customs duty reduction aims to curb gold smuggling, which has increased due to recent high gold prices
About
It is an initiative by the Government of India, launched in November 2015.
It offers a way for investors to buy gold in a paper or digital form rather than physical gold.
Objective
The main objective of this scheme was to reduce the demand for physical gold and shift a part of the gold imported every year for investment purpose into financial savings.
Issuance
Bonds are issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on behalf of the government.
Denomination
Available in multiples of grams of gold, with a minimum investment of 1 gram.
Interest
Investors earn a fixed interest rate of 2.50% per annum, payable semi-annually.
Future of SGB scheme to be decided in September
Following the Budget announcement to cut the import duty on gold, the government plans to make a final decision regarding the future of the SGB scheme in September.
Reasons
As per the experts, the
cost of financing the fiscal deficit through SGBs is quite high
and does not align with the benefits accruing to investors from the scheme.
Government of India finances its fiscal deficit through various instruments, including dated securities, the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF), provident funds, and SGBs
This disparity may lead the government to decide on discontinuing the scheme at the upcoming meeting next month.
Also, SGBs were brought in as an investment (instrument) with a specific objective of curtailing gold imports and holdings. However, the recent customs duty reduction dampen demand for these bonds.
The reduction in gold prices following the customs duty cut has impacted returns on all gold investments, including SGBs, physical gold, and gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Budget 2024-25 and SGB
In the Budget presented on July 23, the government reduced the gross SGB issuances to Rs 18,500 crore from Rs 29,638 crore in the interim budget of February 1.
Net borrowing through SGBs has been cut to Rs 15,000 crore from Rs 26,138 crore previously estimated.

**********SC verdict on SC/ST sub-categorisation
Why in news?
In a significant 6-1 majority ruling, a seven-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court declared that Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) do not form a socially homogeneous group. The court affirmed that states have the authority to sub-classify SCs/STs to provide reservations for the more disadvantaged segments within this category.
This decision allows states to ensure that reservation benefits reach those SC/ST communities that are less privileged and have been historically marginalized within the broader SC/ST category.
What’s in today’s article?
Background of the case
Key highlights of the verdict
Possible implications of this judgement
Constitutional position and attempts by States to sub-categorise SCs
Article 341 of the Constitution
allows the President, through a public notification, to list as SC “castes, races or tribes” that suffered from the historical injustice of untouchability.
SC groups are jointly accorded 15% reservation in education and public employment
In the last three decades, multiple States like Punjab, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu have tried to bring in reservation laws at the State level in a bid to sub-categorise SCs.
In 1975, the Punjab government issued a notification dividing its 25% SC reservation at that time into two categories.
Later, in 2000, a similar law introduced by Andhra Pradesh which was struck down by a five-judge Constitution Bench of SC.
However, all plans were challenged in courts and the Supreme Court formed its larger Constitution Bench to decide the matter.
E. V. Chinnaiah v State of Andhra Pradesh (2004)
:
In this case, apex court held that once a community is included in the Presidential List for Scheduled Castes under
of the Constitution, they become part of a single larger class of people, casting a wide net for the purposes of reservation.
The Bench held:
that the
State did not have the legislative power to create sub-classifications within this single class
that such an action would violate the Right to Equality.
The Constitution has provided that
these lists can only be made by Parliament and notified by the President
Davinder Singh case
In 2020, another five-member Supreme Court bench in the
unanimously ruled that
sub-categorisation is constitutionally valid and suggested a larger constitutional bench rule on the matter
Matter referred to seven-judge bench
A seven-judge Constitution bench is now examining the validity of its 2004 judgment in E V Chinnaiah vs State of Andhra Pradesh.
The top court is examining questions:
whether sub-classification inside the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes categories be permitted like in the case of other backward classes (OBCs) and
if the state assemblies are competent to introduce laws empowering the states to undertake this exercise.
Key highlights of the judgement
Are all castes in the SC list to be treated similarly?
Article 341(1) of the Constitution empowers the President to specify the castes, races, or tribes in a state that shall be deemed Scheduled Castes (SCs) for constitutional purposes.
Article 341(2) states that only Parliament can amend this list.
The current verdict asserted that
inclusion in the Presidential list does not create a uniform, homogenous class that cannot be further classified
CJI Chandrachud described the Presidential list as a "legal fiction," meaning it is treated as real for legal purposes but does not exist in actuality.
SCs are recognized by the Constitution to provide benefits to listed communities.
He emphasized that this legal fiction cannot be extended to ignore the "internal differences" among SCs, thus allowing for sub-classification by states to address varying levels of disadvantage within the SC category.
Can states ‘tinker’ with or sub-classify the Presidential list?
Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution empower states to make special provisions for the advancement of SCs and provide reservations for backward classes in education and public employment.
In the E V Chinnaiah case, the court ruled that states could only provide reservations for SCs as a whole and could not sub-classify SCs to allocate portions of the reserved quota among state-created sub-classes.
However, in the recent verdict, the Court held that
states can use their power under Articles 15 and 16 to identify different degrees of social backwardness within SCs and provide special provisions, such as reservations, accordingly
Justice Gavai emphasized that equality of opportunity (Article 16) must consider the varying social positions of different communities.
Providing the same opportunities to SC communities with different levels of disadvantage would worsen inequality.
What is the yardstick for sub-classification?
The majority opinion in the Supreme Court's ruling set strict guidelines for states on creating sub-quotas for Scheduled Castes (SCs).
States must demonstrate a
need for additional protections, provide empirical evidence, and have a reasonable rationale for sub-classifying SCs
This reasoning can be challenged and tested in court.
CJI Chandrachud emphasized that representation in public services should be "effective representation," not just "numerical representation."
This means that even if an SC community has adequate numerical representation, they may still lack effective representation if they are not promoted to higher positions.
Therefore, states must prove that the sub-group identified within the SCs is more disadvantaged and inadequately represented, based on quantifiable data.
Does the ‘creamy layer’ principle apply to Scheduled Castes?
Only the opinion of Justice Gavai bats for introducing the ‘creamy layer’ exception for SCs (and STs) that is already followed for Other Backward Classes (OBCs).
This concept places an income ceiling on reservation eligibility, ensuring that the beneficiaries are those in a community that need quotas the most.
Four of the seven judges agreed with Justice Gavai’s opinion on the matter.
Dissent by Justice Trivedi
Justice Trivedi, the lone dissenter on the Bench, observed that States do not have the power to alter the Presidential list under Article 341.
She pointed out that any inclusions or exclusions from the list can only be done by the Parliament.
The judge further opined that such sub-classifications would defeat the true import of Article 341 —to eradicate any possibility of political factors dictating constitutionally-mandated affirmative action.
Relief to many states
The ruling is likely to give impetus to States like Punjab, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu which have previously attempted to introduce separate reservations within the SC/ST categories.
In an election rally in Telangana last year, PM Modi promised to look into the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes (SCs) to identify and help the most backward among them.
This move was seen as an attempt by the then ruling party to woo the Madiga community.
The Madigas have claimed that their share of representation was being taken up by another SC community, the Malas.
Demand of caste census
It is also likely to strengthen the Opposition’s demand for a caste census to ascertain the share of different groups in the reservation pie.
