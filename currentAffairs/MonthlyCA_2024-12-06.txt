50 palaeontologists
, visited to study the dinosaur eggs.
What is the History of Dinosaurs in India?
Early Dinosaur Discoveries:
Asia's first
dinosaur bones were discovered in India in
1828 in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh
, by Captain
William Henry Sleeman
which were later named
Titanosaurus indicus
in 1877
, a large
herbivorous
dinosaur that lived during the
Late Cretaceous period.
Dinosaur Fossils: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat
, are key fossil-rich regions that have yielded many dinosaur skeletons and eggs.
Several important species have been discovered in this region are
Barapasaurus
(herbivorous),
Isisaurus
Indosuchus
(carnivorous), and
(carnivorous).
Dinosaur Hatcheries:

What are UNESCO Global Geoparks (Geo Heritage Sites)?
About:
UNESCO Global Geoparks are
unified geographical areas
with internationally significant
geological sites
, managed with a holistic approach to protection, education, and sustainable development.
are locations that have geological significance due to their
unique rock formations, fossils, mineral deposits, or
landforms
Designation Process
: UNESCO Global Geoparks are designated for
four years
, after which they undergo
revalidation
Green Card
: Awarded if the area
continues to meet
the criteria.
Yellow Card
: Issued if the area
no longer meets the criteria
, allowing two years for improvement.
Red Card
fails to meet
the criteria within two years after a yellow card, leading to loss of status.
Global Presence
: As of now, there are a total of
213 UNESCO Global Geoparks across 48 countries
but
India has no
Global Geoparks. E.g.,
Dali-Cangshan UNESCO Global Geopark in China.
Diversity:
Geo heritage sites can include
volcanic formations, fossil-rich areas, caves,
mountain ranges
glacial features
, and mineral-rich regions.
What are Key Facts About Dinosaurs?
Dinosaurs are prehistoric reptiles that have lived on Earth from
about 245 million years ago
to the present.
Modern birds
are considered a type of
due to sharing a common ancestor with
non-avian dinosaurs
Size:
Some dinosaurs were
massive
, such as
Argentinosaurus
, weighing up to
110 tons.
smallest
were tiny species, such as the
bee hummingbird
, which is still a
bird descendant
of dinosaurs.
Classification:
Dinosaurs are classified into
three major groups.
Ornithischia
: Beaked
plant-eaters
, including Stegosaurus and Triceratops.
Sauropodomorpha
: Long-necked,
large-bodied herbivores
like Diplodocus.
Theropoda
Carnivorous dinosaurs
Tyrannosaurus rex
Velociraptor
, including the ancestors of modern birds.
Period:
Most dinosaurs lived during the
Mesozoic Era
(245 to 66 million years ago)
, which is divided into
three periods.
Triassic (252-201 million years ago)
: Reptiles evolved into dinosaurs on the supercontinent
Pangaea
Jurassic (201-145 million years ago)
: Earth cooled, leading to
more plants and dinosaurs,
Brachiosaurus
Cretaceous (145-66 million years ago)
: More continents formed, and
dinosaur diversity increased,
Tyrannosaurus Rex
Diet and Movement
Meat-eaters
walked on
two legs
and hunted alone or in groups whereas
two or four legs
and grazed on plants.
Distinctive Feature
: The key feature that distinguishes dinosaurs from other reptiles is a
hole in the hip socket
, allowing them to
walk upright
Pterosaurs
(flying reptiles) and
plesiosaurs
(ocean-dwelling reptiles) do not have the hip socket feature and are
not classified as dinosaurs.
Extinction
: Dinosaurs went extinct
around 66 million years ago
after a massive asteroid impact during the
(145 million to 66 million years ago)
The asteroid collision with Earth created an
impact crater over 110 miles (180 km)
wide in the
Yucatan Peninsula
, now located in
Mexico.

Mangroves in Coastal Resilience
Source: IE
Why in News?
Recently,
Cyclone Dana's
landfall near
Bhitarkanika National Park
and Dhamra Port in Odisha underscored the essential role of mangrove forests in reducing cyclone impacts.
The cyclone did not cause as significant damage as anticipated due to the rich mangrove forest cover of Bhitarkanika.
Bhitarkanika National Park has withstood the onslaught of several cyclones in the past including the
Super Cyclone,
which took place in October 1999.
What are Mangroves?
About:
Mangroves are salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that thrive in estuarine and intertidal regions where freshwater meets saltwater.
They possess unique adaptations, such as aerial roots and waxy leaves, allowing them to survive in saline environments.
They represent a
littoral forest ecosystem
, which means they thrive in saline or brackish waters in coastal regions
Some common mangrove trees include
Red mangrove, Grey mangrove,
Rhizophora
Mangrove Cover in India:
According to the
Indian State Forest Report 2021
, Mangrove cover in India is 4992 sq. Km which is 0.15% of the country's total geographical area.
Geographical Distribution:
India hosts significant mangrove ecosystems in various states, including Odisha (Bhitarkanika), Andhra Pradesh (Godavari-Krishna delta), Gujarat, Kerala, and the Andaman Islands.
Sundarbans
(spread across India and Bangladesh)
is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world. Bhitarkanika is second only to Sunderbans in terms of mangrove cover in India
Role of Mangroves in Cyclone Mitigation:
Coastal Defence
: Mangroves are the first line of defence for coastal communities. They stabilise shorelines by slowing erosion and provide natural barriers protecting coastal communities.
Storm Surge Protection:
Mangrove forests act as natural barriers against cyclone-driven surges, significantly reducing surge height, water flow velocity, and minimising flooding and coastal damage.".
Integration with Infrastructure:
The effectiveness of mangroves can be enhanced when combined with built infrastructure, such as embankments.
Initiatives for Protection and Conservation of Mangroves:
MISHTI Initiative:
Union Budget 2023-24
announced
MISHTI initiative
for mangrove plantations along the coastline and on salt pan lands.
Mangrove Alliance for Climate:
MAC
includes
UAE, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, Japan, and Spain
. It seeks to educate and spread awareness worldwide on the role of mangroves in curbing global warming and its potential as a solution for climate change.
Blue Carbon Initiative:
It is focused on mitigating climate change through the conservation and restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems.
It is coordinated by Conservation International (CI),
IUCN
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission-UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO)

What are the Challenges with Mangrove Conservation ?
Commercialisation of Coastal Areas:
Aquaculture
, coastal development, rice and palm oil farming and industrial activities are rapidly replacing these salt-tolerant trees and the ecosystems they support.
Temperature Related Issues:
A fluctuation of ten degrees in a short period of time is enough stress to damage the plant and freezing temperatures for even a few hours can kill some mangrove species.
Soil Related Issues:
The soil in which mangroves grow presents a challenge for plants due to its severe lack of oxygen.
Pollution and Contamination:
Pollution from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and improper waste disposal contaminate mangrove habitats.
Lack of Integrated Management:
The management of mangroves often occurs in isolation, failing to recognize their crucial interconnectedness with adjacent ecosystems, such as coral reefs and seagrass beds, which is essential for holistic environmental health.
What can be Done to Preserve Mangroves?
Utilise bio-restoration techniques like
Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR)
to revive degraded mangrove areas, helping to maintain original biodiversity.
Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) is a complementary solution to planting. This solution consists of a soft forest management method that preserves and strengthens existing forests through forest maintenance work that respects and mimics the natural reproduction cycle of trees.
There is a pressing need for policies aimed at conserving existing mangrove forests and restoring degraded areas. Sustainable management practices should be adopted to enhance the resilience of coastal ecosystems.
Engaging local communities in mangrove conservation efforts can foster a sense of ownership and ensure the sustainability of these ecosystems. Education and awareness programs about the benefits of mangroves can promote community-driven conservation initiatives.
Conclusion
Strengthening mangrove conservation efforts is imperative for enhancing India's resilience to cyclones and safeguarding coastal communities. The integration of ecological and infrastructural approaches will be key to achieving long-term sustainability and
disaster risk reduction
Drishti Mains Question:
Examine the role of mangrove ecosystems in mitigating the impacts of cyclones. Discuss the significance of mangrove preservation in India’s coastal disaster management strategy.

WMO’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin 2023
Source: IE
Why in News?
Recently, the
World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)
released its annual
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Bulletin
for the year 2023.
The GHG Bulletin provides the latest analysis from the
WMO Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW
) on atmospheric concentrations of GHGs.
What are the Key Findings of the GHG Bulletin?
GHG Levels and Trends:
Historical Warming:
Since 1990, the warming effect from
increased by
51.5%
, with
CO₂
accounting for approximately
81% of this effect.
Record Highs in 2023:
GHG levels, including
carbon dioxide (CO₂),
methane (CH₄)
, and
nitrous oxide (N₂O)
, reached record levels globally in 2023.
CO₂ rose by 2.3 parts per million (ppm) from 2022, reaching
420 ppm.
Highest Radiative Forcing: 2023
was recorded as the
warmest year
surpassing the previous record set in 2016.
Global temperatures were 1.48°C
above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.
Radiative forcing is the
warming effect on the climate
caused by GHGs.
Historical Comparison:
The current CO₂ concentration is comparable to levels
3-5 million years ago
when global temperatures were
2-3°C higher
, and sea levels were
10-20 metres higher
than today.
This marks the
12
consecutive year
with an annual CO₂ rise exceeding 2 ppm.
Causes of Increased CO₂ Levels:
Human Activities:
Persistent high CO₂ emissions from
fossil fuel
use, alongside
industrial activities
, are major contributors to the increase.
El Niño Impact:
phenomenon, which brings warmer weather and drier conditions, particularly in
South Asia
, caused
drier vegetation
forest fires
, which released more GHGs into the atmosphere and affected the efficiency of land
carbon sinks
Climate Concerns:
Vicious Cycle Warning:
Rising CO₂ levels and
climate change
risk turning natural ecosystems into GHG sources, as warming could lead to
increased carbon release
wildfires
and reduce CO₂ absorption by oceans.
Methane Surge:
Methane saw the largest three-year increase from 2020 to 2022, particularly from natural
wetlands
responding to warmer and wetter
La Niña
conditions.
Reduced Carbon Sink:
It highlighted that
warming oceans
and frequent wildfires could diminish natural GHG absorption.
Policy Responses:
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs):
According to the
UNFCCC
2023 assessment,
can reduce global emissions by 2.6% from 2019 to 2030, which falls significantly short of the
43% reduction needed
to limit warming to 1.5°C as per the
Paris Agreement
UNFCCC’s Call for Stronger NDCs:
Countries are required to submit updated NDCs by February 2024, with the UNFCCC urging this as a critical moment to bridge the gap in global emission reduction efforts.
