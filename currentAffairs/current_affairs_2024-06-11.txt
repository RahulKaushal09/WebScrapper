**********Why are BJP and Allies Vying for the Post of Speaker of Lok Sabha
Why in News?
The TDP and JD (U), two of the BJP's main NDA allies, are reportedly vying for the position of Speaker as the 18th Lok Sabha gets ready to convene.
The Speaker is chosen as the Presiding Officer
of the Lok Sabha following the administration of the oath to new members by a protem or temporary Speaker.
What’s in Today’s Article?
The Office of the Speaker of Lok Sabha
What are the Powers of the Speaker of Lok Sabha?
Significance of the Post of Speaker for the Opposition and the NDA Allies
The Office of the Speaker of Lok Sabha:
About the office: Article 93
of the Indian Constitution provides for the offices of
the Speaker and Deputy Speaker
who are to be elected “as soon as may be” after the commencement of the House.
Election and term of the Speaker:
S/he is elected by a
simple majority
in the House and the term ends with the dissolution of the House. S/he can also resign or can be removed from office before that.
Removal of the Speaker:
As per
Article 94
of the Constitution, a motion of no-confidence can be moved against the Speaker with notice of 14 days. Also, like any other member of the House, s/he can face disqualification.
Qualification of the Speaker:
There are no specific qualifications for becoming Speaker, which means
any member is entitled to be considered
How is the post of Speaker distinct from other members in the House?
The Speaker is the Presiding Officer of the Lok Sabha and plays a crucial role in parliamentary democracy.
The post differs from other members in the following ways -
The placement of the Speaker’s chair in the House.
S/he has a
casting vote
and is in charge of the functioning of the House and plays a crucial constitutional role in dealing with disqualification of members.
The salary of the Speaker is drawn from the
Consolidated Fund of India
unlike for other MPs.
Decides how the Lok Sabha is conducted:
The conduct of government business is decided by the Speaker in consultation with the Leader of the House.
Prior permission
of the Speaker is required for members to ask a question, or to discuss any matter.
The Speaker has vast powers in ensuring that the Rules and Procedure for the functioning of the House are followed.
The Speaker has the power to expunge
(in full or in part) remarks that s/he may consider to be unparliamentary. Critical remarks against the ruling party may not be published if the Speaker decides to expunge them.
When the treasury benches seem thin in the House,
the Speaker can disregard a request for division and push a Bill through by voice vote.
No-Confidence Motion:
One of the most important times when a Speaker’s impartiality impacts the Opposition is when a motion of no-confidence is moved against the government.
For example
, when the YSRCP and TDP gave notices for a motion of no-confidence in 2018, the then Speaker adjourned the House several times before admitting the motion and putting it to vote.
Casting vote:
According to
Article 100
of the Constitution, the Chairman of Rajya Sabha or Speaker of Lok Sabha shall not vote in the first instance, but shall
exercise a casting vote in the case of any equality of votes.
Conventionally, the Speaker votes in favour of the government.
Disqualification of members:
The Tenth Schedule or the anti-defection law
, introduced to the Constitution through the 52nd (Amendment) Act 1985, gives the Speaker of the House the power to disqualify legislators who ‘defect’ from a party.
In the Kihoto Hollohan case (1992)
, the SC upheld the power vested in the Speaker and said that only the final order of the Speaker will be subject to
judicial review
In 2020, the Supreme Court had ruled that Speakers of Assemblies and Lok Sabha must decide
disqualification pleas within 3 months
except in extraordinary circumstances.
Significance of the Post of Speaker for the Opposition and the NDA Allies:
For the Opposition to have a voice in the House,
the Speaker's neutrality/impartiality is an essential check and balance.
What makes the Speaker even more important is that -
S/he is considered the
final interpreter
of the provisions of the Constitution of India (in matters dealing with Lok Sabha), the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of Lok Sabha.
S/he also decides on the disqualification of a member and is the
final authority on matters of defection.
The power of the Speaker under the
Tenth Schedule of the Constitution
is perhaps more significant than how the House is conducted
because
Defections can alter numbers in the House and cause a government to fall.
If the Speaker acts in a timely manner and disqualifies such members, then the new government may not have a majority.
However, a delay in deciding the disqualification petitions can vitiate the Tenth Schedule.
, the SC had directed in 2023 the then Maharashtra Assembly Speaker to initiate disqualification proceedings against MLAs of the two factions of the Shiv Sena at the earliest.
The petitions of disqualification had been pending
for more than 1.5 years at that point, which had caused the Uddhav-led administration to fall.

**********A push for more Climate Action
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)
Mains level:
New Elements in the ITLOS Advisory Opinion on Climate Change
Why in the news?
On May 21, 2024, ITLOS issued an advisory opinion for COSIS, clarifying UNCLOS obligations for climate change mitigation and marine pollution control.”
About International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)
The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) is an independent judicial body established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to adjudicate disputes arising out of the
interpretation and application of the Convention.
Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law (COSIS)
It was established in 2021. COSIS was formed as an association of small island states, which are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. COSIS aims to address and mitigate the unique challenges that small island states face due to climate change.
It seeks to leverage international law to advocate for stronger climate action and protection measures.
Broad Interpretation of Obligations:
The ITLOS extended its interpretation of obligations under UNCLOS to include not just parties to the COSIS Agreement but all states, emphasizing that climate change mitigation responsibilities apply universally.
Recognition of GHG Emissions as Marine Pollution:
The Tribunal explicitly recognized anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide, as a form of marine pollution under Article 194(1) of UNCLOS, necessitating measures to prevent, reduce, and control these emissions.
Adoption of the 1.5°C Temperature Goal:
The Opinion aligned necessary climate actions with the more ambitious 1.5°C global temperature goal, reflecting the latest scientific consensus and international climate commitments, thus raising the standard for state obligations under UNCLOS.
Legal Significance
Principle of Prevention and Collective Interest:
The Opinion embraces the principle of prevention, typically applied bilaterally, in a collective context for addressing climate change.
Stringent Due Diligence Obligation:
The ITLOS describes the obligation to take necessary measures to mitigate climate change as a due diligence obligation. However, the standard of conduct is stringent due to the high risks of serious and irreversible harm to the marine environment from GHG emissions.
General Obligation to Mitigate Climate Change:
While the Opinion outlines a general obligation under Article 194(1) of the UNCLOS, it is somewhat general in nature, allowing for measures that gradually reduce GHG emissions over time. This underscores that states do not have unrestricted discretion in their climate actions.
Equity and State Capabilities:
The Opinion incorporates the principle of equity, recognizing that the necessary measures for GHG reduction are subject to states’ means and capabilities. This acknowledges differences in states’ capacities to address climate change and ensures that obligations are realistic and fair.
Political Influence Despite Lack of Legal Force:
Although the advisory opinion lacks binding legal force, it holds substantial political influence as an authoritative judicial pronouncement. This can guide future legal interpretations and state actions in international climate change law.
Conclusion:
ITLOS plays a critical role in the interpretation and application of the law of the sea, providing a judicial forum for resolving maritime disputes and offering authoritative guidance on emerging global issues like climate change. The recent advisory opinion underscores the Tribunal’s capacity to address complex and pressing environmental challenges, contributing to the evolving landscape of international environmental law.
Mains PYQ:
Describe the major outcomes of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). What are the commitments made by India in this conference?

**********Why India needs a third aircraft carrier
Security Issues
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Future Scope and Concerns associated with Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-2 (IAC-2)
Why in the news?
Recent reports from the media suggest that the Indian Navy’s persistent request for a third aircraft carrier is edging closer to reality, as Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) prepares to commence construction on an additional Vikrant-class platform weighing approximately 40,000 tonnes.
About Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-2 (IAC-2)
The Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-2 (IAC-2) is a proposed second Indigenous aircraft carrier for the Indian Navy.
It is planned to be similar to the first indigenous aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, but with some modifications.
The IAC-2 is expected to have a displacement of around 45,000 tonnes and will be equipped with STOBAR (short take-off but arrested recovery or short take-off, barrier-arrested recovery) technology.
Operational Versatility:
IAC-2 will enhance the Indian Navy’s operational flexibility, enabling it to conduct a wide range of missions including power projection, maritime security, and humanitarian assistance. The carrier’s advanced capabilities and modern technologies will ensure its effectiveness in addressing evolving maritime challenges.
Strategic Deterrence:
IAC-2 will serve as a key deterrent against potential adversaries, bolstering India’s maritime deterrence posture and signalling its commitment to safeguarding its maritime interests. Its presence will reinforce India’s position as a major maritime power in the Indo-Pacific region, contributing to regional stability and security.
Technological Advancement:
The construction and operation of IAC-2 will drive technological innovation and advancement in India’s indigenous defence industry. It will stimulate research and development efforts, fostering self-reliance and technological sovereignty in naval defence capabilities.
Budgetary issues:
The estimated cost of constructing and operating IAC-2 is high, raising concerns about budgetary constraints and the allocation of resources amidst competing defence priorities.
Operational Vulnerabilities:
IAC-2 may face challenges from evolving anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies employed by potential adversaries such as China and Pakistan. The carrier’s large size and visibility make it susceptible to modern maritime warfare tactics, including advanced missile systems and submarine threats, potentially compromising its operational effectiveness.
Strategic Alignment:
Questions may arise about the carrier’s role and relevance in addressing contemporary security threats and whether alternative defence investments would provide better national security and strategic deterrence returns.
Upgrading Capabilities as a Solution
Enhanced Airborne Capabilities:
The Indian Air Force (IAF) can project maritime power using aircraft like the SEPECAT Jaguar IM/IS and Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighters, which can carry advanced maritime strike weapons. The Su-30MKI squadron, equipped with BrahMos-A supersonic cruise missiles, enhances maritime strike capabilities.
Strengthening Island Defenses:
Upgrading the military capabilities of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago could create an A2/AD maritime ‘exclusive zone’, deterring Chinese naval activities.
Balanced Force Development:
Diversifying investments to upgrade existing surface combatants, submarines, and air assets can provide a balanced approach to enhancing naval capabilities. Ensuring adequate funding for other critical areas like mine counter-measures, maritime patrol aircraft, and naval utility helicopters is essential for comprehensive maritime security.
Conclusion:
While the IAC-2 represents a significant advancement in India’s naval capabilities, addressing financial constraints, strategic vulnerabilities, and diversifying investments in maritime and airborne assets are crucial for achieving a robust and balanced defence strategy.

**********On Special Category Status for Andhra    
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Benchmark for the granting of SCS
Mains level:
Why is the demand for special status for Andhra Pradesh back in the political limelight?
Why in the news?
Now with the completion of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the demand for SCS to Andhra is again gaining attention.
Unfulfilled Promise:
Despite assurances by the previous Prime Minister and BJP leaders, the Special Category Status (SCS) promised to Andhra Pradesh post bifurcation remained unfulfilled.
Economic Struggles:
Andhra Pradesh faces revenue deficits and escalating debts post-bifurcation, hampering its development projects and infrastructure initiatives.
Dependency on Central Aid:
With the need for funding for critical projects like Amaravati’s development and ongoing revenue deficits, Andhra Pradesh seeks central assistance for its economic stability and growth.
Five factors stood as the qualifying benchmark for the granting of SCS
States that comprise a majority tribal population, low density of population, hilly States and close to international borders, States that have socio-economic and industrial backwardness, and lack adequate State finances.
At present
, the States that have the SCS include Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, and Uttarakhand.
Why did Chandrababu Naidu, back in 2018, settle for a special package?
Pressure from Opposition
: Facing criticism and a strong opposition campaign over the unmet promise of SCS, Naidu, then allied with the NDA, agreed to a Special Package (SP) as an alternative.
Naidu’s decision to accept the SP was influenced by political considerations, including the need to maintain stability within the NDA alliance and counter opposition attacks.
Is the State qualified to be granted special status?
Debatable Qualification:
Andhra Pradesh’s eligibility for SCS is contested, with some arguing it doesn’t meet the criteria outlined for special status, including socio-economic and geographical disadvantages.
Previous Annulment:
The 14th Finance Commission equated SCS with general category status and annulled it for new states, citing increased tax devolution and revenue deficit grants as alternatives.
What did the 14th Finance Commission state?
Alternative Grants:
Instead of SCS, the commission increased tax devolution to states and introduced revenue deficit grants to address fiscal disparities, providing Andhra Pradesh with financial assistance.
Scope for Review:
While the 14th Finance Commission did not explicitly rule out SCS, it left the decision to the Union Government, suggesting a potential review by subsequent finance commissions and policy bodies.
Way forward:
Comprehensive Economic Reform:
Implement structural reforms to boost economic growth, reduce fiscal deficits, and attract investments, ensuring sustainable development beyond dependency on special status or central aid.
Targeted Development Projects:
Prioritize funding for infrastructure projects based on critical needs and potential economic returns, focusing on sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and technology to drive growth and employment.
Mains PYQ:
The political and administrative reorganization of states and territories has been a continuous ongoing process since the mid-nineteenth century. Discuss with examples.

**********What are the powers of the Speaker, why is the post crucial for BJP, its allies
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Constitutional mandate of the Speaker
Mains level:
Powers of the Speaker
Why in the news?
The pivotal role of the Speaker in parliamentary democracy is underscored as both the TDP and JD(U), crucial allies within the NDA, compete for the position, highlighting its significance.
Constitutional mandate:
Speaker and Deputy Speaker are elected as per
Article 93 of the Constitution
, with the Speaker chosen by a simple majority.
The speaker’s term ends with the House dissolution and no-confidence motion can be moved against the Speaker.
No specific qualifications for the Speaker, who is distinct from other members.
Conducting the House: The
Speaker decides House conduct and government business, ensuring adherence to rules, crucial for opposition participation. There are Rules and Procedure for the functioning of the House, but the Speaker has vast powers in ensuring these Rules are followed, and in choosing procedures.
Questions & Records:
The Speaker holds authority over determining the validity of queries raised by members and overseeing the publication of House proceedings. The Speaker possesses the power to remove, wholly or partially, statements deemed unparliamentary.
Voice Votes, Division:
The speaker can push bills through by voice vote or division, crucial for the legislative process.
As per the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha, if the Speaker thinks that is “unnecessarily claimed”, simply ask the members who are for ‘Aye’ and those for ‘No’ respectively to rise in their places and decide.
No-Confidence Motion:
A pivotal moment where the Speaker’s neutrality significantly affects the Opposition is during the presentation of a motion of no-confidence against the government.
In 2018, when notices for a no-confidence motion were submitted by the YSRCP and TDP, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan postponed the House multiple times before acknowledging the motion and conducting the vote.
Casting Vote:
As per Article 100 of the Constitution, pertaining to voting in the Houses, the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha or the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, or any individual acting in such a capacity, “shall refrain from voting initially but must cast a deciding vote in the event of a tie.”
Disqualification of members
Power of the Speaker:
The Speaker of the House holds the authority to disqualify legislators who defect from their party, as per the provisions of the Tenth Schedule.
Introduction of the Anti-Defection Law:
The Tenth Schedule, also known as the anti-defection law, was incorporated into the Constitution in 1985 through the Fifty-Second (Amendment) Act.
Judicial Review:
The Supreme Court, in the landmark case of Kihoto Hollohan versus Zachillhu in 1992, upheld the power vested in the Speaker to decide on defection cases. It ruled that only the final order of the Speaker is subject to judicial review.
Impact on Government Stability:
Defections can change the numerical strength of political parties in the House, potentially destabilizing governments if members defect in significant numbers. Timely action by the Speaker in disqualifying defective members is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the Tenth Schedule and ensuring that governments retain their majority.
Supreme Court Directives:
The Supreme Court has issued directives emphasizing the need for Speakers to expedite disqualification proceedings. For instance, in 2020, it ruled that Speakers must decide on disqualification pleas within three months, except in exceptional circumstances.
Impact on Government Formation:
Delays in deciding disqualification petitions can have significant political ramifications, as seen in cases where governments have collapsed due to prolonged delays in addressing defection issues.
Case Example:
In 2023, the Supreme Court directed the Maharashtra Assembly Speaker to expedite disqualification proceedings against members of factions within the Shiv Sena party. Prolonged delays in these proceedings contributed to the collapse of the government led by Uddhav Thackeray.
Conclusion:
The Speaker holds significant powers in conducting the House, ensuring adherence to rules, deciding on crucial matters like no-confidence motions, and maintaining political stability through the judicious application of these powers.
Mains PYQ:
Q ‘
Once a Speaker, Always a Speaker’! Do you think this practice should be adopted to impart objectivity to the office of the Speaker of Lok Sabha? What could be its implications for the robust functioning of parliamentary business in India?

and established their importance in solar-terrestrial relations later in the 1980s.
It consists of
massive clouds of solar plasma
and magnetic field lines.
It typically accompanies
solar flares and filament
eruptions.
The frequency of CMEs varies with the
11-year solar cycle
, with about one a week observed during solar minimum and an average of two to three CMEs per day observed near solar maximum
They
travel
at thousands of km per hour.
They can lead to
geomagnetic storms
, aurorae, and in extreme cases, damage to electrical power grids.
Not all CMEs interact with Earth
, but those that do can cause disruptions to satellite communications and power grids.
Halo CMEs
Earth-directed CMEs visible as rings
in white-light coronagraph observations.
About Aditya-L1:
Aditya-L1 mission is India’s first space mission to observe the Sun.
It is ISRO’s 2nd space-based astronomy mission after AstroSat, which was launched in 2015.
It was launched on September 2nd 2023 to observe the Sun and the solar corona.
The L1 point is a location in space where the gravitational forces of two massive objects, such as the Earth and the Sun, balance each other out, allowing a spacecraft to “hover” in a stable orbit.
Launch Details:
Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) with 7 payloads (instruments) on board.
The 7 payloads include:
Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC):
Images of the solar corona in visible light to study its structure and dynamics.
Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT):
Images the solar chromosphere and transition region in ultraviolet light to understand heating and dynamics.
Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS):
Measures solar X-ray spectrum to study solar flares and coronal mass ejections.
High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS):
Measures high-energy solar X-rays to understand particle acceleration.
Plasma Analyser Package for Aditya (PAPA):
Measures solar wind plasma properties to study its interaction with Earth’s magnetosphere.
Aditya Solar Wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX):
Measures energetic particle properties in the solar wind to study their effects on Earth’s atmosphere.
Solar Irradiance Monitor (SIM):
Measures solar irradiance variations and their impact on Earth’s climate.
Objectives:
Aditya L1 will study the coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry, origin and monitoring of near-UV solar radiation and continuously observe the photosphere, chromosphere and corona, solar energetic particles and the magnetic field of the Sun.
Location:
Aditya is placed in
L1 Halo orbit
which is about
1.5 million km from the Earth
. The orbit allows the mission to look at the Sun continuously.
L1 refers to Lagrangian/Lagrange Point 1, one of 5 points in the orbital plane of the Earth-Sun system.
Lagrange Points are positions in space where the gravitational forces of a two-body system like the Sun and Earth produce enhanced regions of attraction and repulsion.

**********What is happening in the French territory of New Caledonia?
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Mapping of New Caledonia
Why in the News?
New Caledonia, France’s Pacific island territory, is under a state of emergency due to deadly riots.
About New Caledonia
New Caledonia is a
French overseas territory
in the Pacific.
It enjoys a
large degree of autonomy
but depends heavily on France for matters like defence and education.
It includes the island of New Caledonia where the
capital, Noumea
, is located, the Loyalty Islands; the Belep Islands; and the Ile des Pins.
New Caledonia’s lagoons
were designated a
UNESCO World Heritage site
in 2008.
The Crisis: A Quick Recap
New Law:
The French government passed a law that has upset people in New Caledonia.
Vote Reforms:
Now, French citizens who lived on the island for 10 years or more can vote. The government says it’s fairer this way.
Resistance from Indigenous people:
The locals, especially the Kanak community, feel this gives too much power to French settlers and stops them from gaining independence.
How did France occupy this territory?
Exploration:
British explorer James Cook named the island New Caledonia in 1774 after the Latin name for Scotland.
French Annexation:
France annexed it in 1853 and New Caledonia became a French overseas territory in 1946.
Fewer Locals:
France brought in lots of French people. Now, the original Kanak people are only 40% of the population, while others, like the Caldoches and newer French arrivals, make up the rest.
Past Protests and Promises
There were similar fights in the 1990s, leading to promises of more power for locals.
In 2018, 2020, and 2021, they voted on whether to be independent from France. But many boycotted the last vote, saying it wasn’t fair because of the pandemic.
Why is it significant for France?
France sees New Caledonia as
important for keeping power
in the region.
It wants to
stay strong in the Pacific
to stand up to other big powers, like China.
