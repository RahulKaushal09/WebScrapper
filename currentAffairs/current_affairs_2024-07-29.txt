INNER LINE PERMIT SYSTEM
Syllabus
Prelims & Mains – Polity
Context:
Different groups in the Khasi hills are applying pressure tactics to push for introduction of an Inner Line Permit system in Meghalaya.
Background:
There have been instances of locals setting up “check post” in Meghalaya to check documentation of vehicles entering the state from Assam and to check non-local workers in and around Shillong for work permits.
About Inner Line Permit system
Inner Line Permit (ILP) is an official travel document by the Government of India to allow inward travel of an Indian citizen into a protected area for a limited period.
It is obligatory for Indian citizens from outside those states to obtain a permit for entering into the protected state.
The document is an effort by the government to regulate movement to certain areas.
This is an offshoot of the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations, 1873, which protected Crown’s interest in the tea, oil and elephant trade by prohibiting “British subjects” from entering into these “Protected Areas” (to prevent them from establishing any commercial venture that could rival the Crown’s agents).
The word “British subjects” was replaced by Citizen of India in 1950.
Despite the fact that the ILP was originally created by the British to safeguard their commercial interests, it continues to be used in India, officially to protect tribal cultures in northeastern India.
There are different kinds of ILP’s, one for tourists and others for people who intend to stay for long-term periods, often for employment purposes.
The states which require the permit are:
Arunachal Pradesh
It is issued by the secretary (political) of the Government of Arunachal Pradesh.
It is required for entering Arunachal Pradesh through any of the check gates across the interstate border with Assam or Nagaland.
Mizoram
It is issued by the Government of Mizoram. It is required for entering Mizoram through any of the check gates across the inter-State borders.If arriving by air, an ILP can be obtained on arrival at Lengpui Airport in Aizawl.
It is issued by the Government of Nagaland. It is mandatory for Indian citizens of other states entering Nagaland through any of the check gates across the interstate borders. Dimapur, Nagaland’s largest city is the only place in the state which does not require an ILP, and Indians arriving by air at Dimapur Airport can arrive and stay in the city without one.

NICOBAR PORT PLAN
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
A high-powered committee (HPC), appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and tasked with revisiting the green clearance for the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, has concluded that a proposed transshipment port does not fall in the Island Coastal Regulation Zone-IA (ICRZ-IA), where ports are prohibited, but is in ICRZ-IB where these are permitted.
Background:-
The Great Nicobar ‘Holistic Development’ Project was conceived by the NITI Aayog and the key plan includes construction of an international container transshipment terminal among other facilities.

Key takeaways
A special bench of the NGT had constituted the HPC in April 2023, while hearing a challenge against the Great Nicobar project’s environmental clearance. NGT formed the HPC to revisit the environmental clearance to address some unanswered deficiencies.
The special bench had ordered that no further work should happen until the HPC gave its report.
Among the issues the HPC had to revisit was protection of 4,518 coral colonies, limited one-season baseline data collection for assessing the project’s environmental impact and the issue of project components falling in the ecologically sensitive ICRZ-IA area.
Regarding the coral colonies, the HPC said that it agreed with the Zoological Survey of India’s recommendation to translocate 16,150 out of 20,668 coral colonies. For the remaining 4,518, for which there was no plan outlined, the HPC directed continuous observation from 15-30 metres depth to analyse the sedimentation load and rate of sedimentation before any decision is taken to translocate them.
On baseline data collected, the HPC said that one-season’s, other than monsoon, was enough to assess environmental impact as per the EIA notification, 2006.
HPC also concluded that the proposed transshipment port does not fall in the Island Coastal Regulation Zone-IA (ICRZ-IA). This conclusion by HPC is at variance with the information submitted by the Andaman & Nicobar (A&N) Coastal Management Authority during the green clearance process for the project. The Authority had stated that parts of the port, airport and township planned under the project are spread over 7 sq km in the ICRZ-IA area.
About Island Coastal Regulation Zone-IA (ICRZ-IA)
The ICRZ-IA areas comprise ecologically sensitive areas such as mangroves, corals and coral reefs, sand dunes, mudflats, marine parks, wildlife habitats, salt marshes, turtle nesting grounds and bird nesting grounds among others.
Only eco-tourism activities such as mangrove walks and natural trails, roads and roads-on-stilts in defence and strategic projects and public utilities are allowed in this area with permits from the UT and Centre.
About Andaman and Nicobar Islands
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a cluster of 836 islands, split into two groups — the Andaman Islands to the north and the Nicobar Islands to the south — by the 150-km wide Ten Degree Channel.
Great Nicobar is the southernmost and largest of the Nicobar Islands, a sparsely inhabited 910-sq-km patch of mainly tropical rainforest in southeastern Bay of Bengal.
Great Nicobar has two national parks, a biosphere reserve, small populations of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribal peoples, and a few thousand non-tribal settlers.

VENTURE CAPITAL FUND
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the proposal to set up a venture capital fund of Rs 1,000 crore dedicated to the space economy.
The announcement, made during the Union Budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024-25, highlights the government’s commitment to advance the Indian space sector.
What is a Venture Capital Fund?
A venture capital fund is a pooled investment vehicle that manages the money of investors seeking private equity stakes in startups and small- to medium-sized enterprises with strong growth potential.
Key Characteristics
High Risk, High Return: VC funds target high-growth firms that are also quite risky. The potential for high returns is what attracts investors.
Long-Term Engagement: Investments are usually long-term, as it takes time for startups to grow and become profitable.
Active Involvement: VC funds often take a hands-on approach, providing not just capital but also guidance and managerial expertise.
How private venture funds work?
Raising Capital: VC funds raise capital from external investors, which can include wealthy individuals, investment banks, and other financial institutions.
Investment Process: Fund managers review numerous business plans to identify potential high-growth startups. They then create a prospectus, a formal document outlining the investment details, which is shared with potential investors.
Stages of Investment: VC investments can be categorized into seed capital, early-stage capital, or expansion-stage financing, depending on the maturity of the business at the time of investment.
Benefits for Startups
Financial Support: Startups receive the necessary funds to grow their operations.
Expertise and Guidance: In addition to financial support, startups benefit from the technical and managerial expertise of the venture capitalists.

WHITE CATEGORY SECTORS
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
Industries categorised under the ‘white category’ by the Central Pollution Control Board will now not require prior permission of the state pollution control boards to establish and operate under the Air Act, 1981 and Water Act, 1974, according to two separate draft notifications of the Environment Ministry.
These permissions known officially as ‘consent to establish’ (CTE) and ‘consent to operate’ (CTO) are granted to regulate industries that discharge effluents or emit pollutants into the environment.
Categorisation of Industry
The purpose of categorization of industry is to ensure that industries are established in a manner which is consistent with the environmental objectives.
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has developed the criteria of categorization of industrial sectors based on the Pollution Index which is a function of the emissions (air pollutants), effluents (water pollutants), hazardous wastes generated and consumption of resources.
For this purpose the references are taken from the the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution ) Cess (Amendment) Act, 2003, Standards so far prescribed for various pollutants under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Doon Valley Notification, 1989 issued by MoEFCC.
The Pollution Index PI of any industrial sector is a number from 0 to 100 and the increasing value of PI denotes the increasing degree of pollution load from the industrial sector.
The following are the criteria on ‘Range of Pollution Index’ for the purpose of categorization of industrial sectors.
Industrial Sectors having Pollution Index score of 60 and above – Red category
Industrial Sectors having Pollution Index score of 41 to 59 – Orange category
Industrial Sectors having Pollution Index score of 21 to 40 – Green category
Industrial Sectors having Pollution Index score incl.& upto 20 – White category
So white category of industries pertains to those industrial sectors which are practically nonpolluting or least polluting.
Wind and solar power projects, assembly of air coolers, bicycle assembly are some examples of the activities that come under the white category.

YAMUNA RIVER
Prelims – GEOGRAPHY
: Several structures in the Yamunotri Dham area were damaged after water levels of the Yamuna River surged due to heavy rains.
Yamunotri Dham is a part of Chota Char Dham (along with Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath), the four major Hindu pilgrimages sites in the Himalayas.
Key Takeaways :
The Yamuna River originates from the Yamunotri Glacier near Bandarpoonch Peak in the Mussoorie range of the Lower Himalayas in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India.
It flows swiftly through the Himalayan foothills, exits Uttarakhand, and enters the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
Along the border between Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, it feeds the Eastern and Western Yamuna canals.
Cities and Landmarks:
The Yamuna passes through Delhi, where it feeds the Agra Canal.
It then flows south-eastward near Mathura, passing through Agra, Firozabad, and Etawah.
Confluence:
Near Prayagraj (Allahabad), after a course of about 855 miles (1,376 km), the Yamuna joins the Ganges (Ganga) River.
This confluence is an especially sacred place for Hindus and hosts annual festivals and the Kumbh Mela, attended by millions of devotees.
Tributaries:
The Yamuna is nourished by several tributaries such as Chambal River, Sindh River, Betwa River, Hindon River Ken River and Tons River.

NASA'S PERSEVERANCE ROVER
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
:  NASA’s Perseverance rover recently made an intriguing discovery that could shed light on the ancient history of Mars and the possibility of past microbial life.
The rover has identified a rock named “Cheyava Falls” that exhibits intriguing characteristics, suggesting it may have hosted microbial life billions of years ago.
About NASA’s Perseverance rover :
Perseverance is part of NASA’s Mars 2020 Mission, which aims to study the geology, climate, and potential habitability of Mars.
Its primary goal is to seek signs of ancient microbial life and collect samples for possible return to Earth.
Launch and Landing:
Launched on July 30, 2020, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, Perseverance embarked on its journey to Mars.
It successfully landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021, after a complex entry, descent, and landing sequence.
Physical Characteristics:
Perseverance is approximately 3 meters long, 2.7 meters wide, and 2.2 meters tall.
Despite its car-like size, it weighs only about 1,025 kilograms due to careful design and lightweight materials.
Scientific Instruments:
The rover is equipped with a suite of scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and environmental sensors.
Its robotic arm features a drill for sampling rocks and regolith (soil) from the Martian surface.
Power Source:
Perseverance relies on a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) for electricity.
The MMRTG converts heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium into electrical power, allowing the rover to operate even in harsh Martian conditions.
Sample Collection and Return:
Perseverance will collect rock and soil samples, encase them in sealed tubes, and leave them on the Martian surface.
A future mission (possibly by another rover) will retrieve these samples and bring them back to Earth for detailed analysis.

**********Ethanol Used In Petrol Now More From Maize, Damaged Foodgrains Than Sugar
Why in the News?
In the current supply year, from November 2023 to October 2024, sugar mills and distilleries provided 401 crore litres of ethanol to oil marketing companies by June 30.
Of this total, 211 crore litres (52.7%) were produced using maize and damaged food grains (primarily broken or old rice unfit for human consumption).
The remaining 190 crore litres were derived from sugarcane-based feedstocks, including molasses and whole juice/syrup.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Biofuel (Definition, Purpose, Types of Biofuels)
Ethanol Blending (Meaning, how it is done, Blending in India)
News Summary (Reasons Behind Positive Change)
About Biofuel:
Biofuel is a
fuel that is produced over a short time span from biomass, rather than by the very slow natural processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as oil
Since biomass can be used as a fuel directly (e.g., wood logs), some people use the words biomass and biofuel interchangeably.
However, the
word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels
, used for transportation.
Most of biofuel consumption occurs as a blend with refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, and kerosene-type jet fuel.
However, some biofuels do not require blending with their petroleum counterparts and are referred to as drop-in biofuels.
The most common biofuels now are:
Bioalcohols
such as ethanol, propanol, and butanol (a substitute for petrol/gasoline);
Biodiesel
(a substitute for diesel);
Bio-oils
(substitutes for kerosene).
Generations of Biofuel:
What is Ethanol Blending?
Ethanol is a biofuel, naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or by petrochemical processes like ethylene hydration.
high in oxygen content, allowing an engine to more thoroughly combust fuel
In ethanol blending, a blended motor fuel containing ethyl alcohol derived from agricultural products is blended with petrol specifically.
How is Ethanol Produced?
In India, the nodal department for the promotion of fuel-grade ethanol-producing distilleries is the
Department of Food and Public Distribution
(DFPD).
Ethanol is produced or procured from sugarcane-based raw materials which are – C & B heavy molasses, sugarcane juice, sugar syrup, surplus rice with Food Corporation of India (FCI) and maize.
A paper released by the NITI Aayog stated, that in 2019, over 110 billion liters of ethanol fuel was produced globally.
US and Brazil account for 84% of the global production followed by the European Union, China, India, Canada and Thailand
What are the Benefits of Ethanol Blending?
Presently,
India imports over 85 per cent of its oil requirement and ethanol blending could help in reducing dependency on petroleum
In 2020-21, the net import of petroleum in India was 185 million tones at
USD 551 billion
Thus, ethanol blending can help in saving billions of dollars for the country and reduce import dependency.
Also, ethanol is a less polluting fuel and equally efficient at a lower cost than petrol.
India’s Biofuel Policy:
In 2021-22, the
Central government amended the Biofuel Policy (2018) to set a target of country-wide blending rates of 20% ethanol and 5% biodiesel by 2025
According to the Roadmap for ethanol blending in India 2020-2025 report from NITI Aayog,
India will need to increase ethanol production capacity from the expected 3.3 billion liters (in 2020–2021) to at least 10.2 billion liters (5.5 billion liters from sugarcane and 4.7 billion liters from grains) by 2025
Ethanol Used In Petrol Now More From Maize, Damaged Foodgrains Than Sugar:
During the current supply year (November 2023 to October 2024), sugar mills and distilleries have supplied 401 crore litres of ethanol to oil marketing companies up to June 30.
Of this total, 211 crore litres, or 52.7%, were produced using maize and damaged foodgrains (primarily broken or old rice unsuitable for human consumption).
This is the first time that the contribution of grains to India’s ethanol production has surpassed 50% — from 27.1% in 2022-23, 16.7% in 2021-22, 13.6% in 2020-21, 9.2% in 2019-20, 5% in 2018-19 and zero in 2017-18.
Reasons Behind this Positive Change:
Until 2017-18, ethanol production in India was limited to C-heavy molasses, a sugar industry byproduct.
The Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) program expanded in 2018-19 under the current government, allowing production from B-heavy molasses and whole cane juice/syrup, with mills receiving higher prices to offset reduced sugar production.
The program further diversified when mills began using grains like surplus and damaged rice from the Food Corporation of India (FCI).
From July 2023, the government stopped supplying FCI rice and restricted the use of cane juice and B-heavy molasses due to concerns over cereal and sugar inflation.
Consequently,
maize has become the primary ethanol feedstock, incentivized by a higher ex-distillery price of Rs 71.86 per litre
The EBP program now uses multiple feedstocks to meet ethanol demand, benefiting maize farmers in states like Karnataka and Bihar.
However, poultry and livestock feed industries report a domestic maize shortage, with production at 36 million tonnes against a requirement of 41 million tonnes.
The government has allowed 0.5 million tonnes of maize imports at a 15% concessional duty, but the industry seeks up to 5 million tonnes of imports at zero duty.

**********Government Proposes Including Class 9-11 Performance in Class 12 Report Card
Why in news?
A recent report by PARAKH, a unit established within NCERT to standardize assessments across school boards, recommends that a student’s performance in Classes 9, 10, and 11—based on exams and continuous classwork—should contribute to their final marks at the end of Class 12.
This recommendation aligns with the National Education Policy and aims to ensure common assessment standards, develop capacity, conduct achievement surveys, and establish equivalence among different school boards.
What’s in today’s article?
Recommendations by PARAKH
PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development)
About
National Assessment Centre- PARAKH was set up in NCERT as an independent body in 2023.
PARAKH team will consist of leading assessment experts with a deep understanding of the education system in India and internationally.
PARAKH will eventually become the
national single-window source
for all assessment-related information and expertise, with a mandate to assist all forms of learning assessment, both nationally and globally.
Objective
To fulfil the basic objectives of setting norms, standards, guidelines and implement activities related to student assessment along with other tasks as mandated by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.
Four major areas of focus for PARAKH
Capacity Development in Competency-Based Assessment:
Project Vidyasagar –
is organizing workshops across India to familiarize educators with the new pedagogical and policy changes in the National Curriculum Framework 2023.
The goal is to bridge gaps in implementing competency-based learning and teaching.
Large-Scale Achievement Survey:
PARAKH conducted the State Educational Achievement Survey in November 2023, assessing students in Grades 3, 6, and 9 across 30 States/UTs.
The survey aims to monitor and assess educational competencies in foundational literacy, numeracy, language, and mathematics.
Equivalence of School Boards:
PARAKH is working to standardize examination reforms across all Indian school boards.
Regional workshops were held to collect data on administration, curriculum, assessments, and infrastructure.
A report was prepared, and national workshops were conducted to discuss and draft policy recommendations for equivalence. T
The goal is to allocate credit points to academic, vocational, and experiential learning.
Holistic Progress Cards
The Holistic Progress Card, or HPC, will no longer depend on marks or grades to evaluate a student’s academic performance. Instead, it will rely on a 360-degree evaluation.
Under the HPC model, the students will be regularly assessed through class activities where they are not just passive learners but active agents.
The activities will prompt students to apply diverse skills and competencies that will demonstrate whether they have been able to grasp concepts.
Significance:
Uniformity:
PARAKH would be expected to
address the issue of differences
in scores among students associated with different boards, who are at a disadvantage during college admissions when compared to their CBSE peers.
Standardisation:
It will establish and implement technical standards for test design, administration, analysis and reporting at all levels of schooling.
Skill development:
It will encourage and help school boards to shift their assessment patterns towards meeting the skill requirements of the 21st century.
Include performance from Classes 9, 10, and 11 in final assessment for class 12
Include performance from Classes 9, 10, and 11 in the final Class 12 report card, with a weight of 15% for Class 9, 20% for Class 10, 25% for Class 11, and 40% for Class 12.
Evaluation using combined method
Evaluation should be a combination of:
formative assessments (continuous classroom assessments through holistic progress cards, group discussions, projects) and
summative assessments (term-end examinations).
In Class 9, 70% of the final score be drawn from formative assessments and 30% from summative assessments.
In Class 10, the final score will be based 50% on formative assessments and 50% on summative assessments.
For Class 11, it will be 40% formative and 60% summative assessments.
In Class 12, the weight for formative assessments will drop to 30% with 70% of the final score based on summative assessments.
Assessments be in terms of credits
PARAKH has also suggested that the assessments be in terms of credits: a student can earn 40 credits in Classes 9 and 10 each, and 44 credits in Classes 11 and 12 each.
In Classes 9 and 10, 32 credits will be subject-specific (12 credits in three languages; four credits in mathematics; four for science, four for social science etc).
Facilitate credit transfer in line with the National Credit Framework
Recommendations include that boards should develop a system of credit transfer in line with the National Credit Framework.

**********CITES eases export of agarwood from India
Why in news?
India has successfully prevented inclusion of
Aquilaria malaccensis (agarwood)
in the Review of Significant Trade (RST) of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
The CITES also notified a new export quota of highly valuable and aromatic resinous wood and oil of agarwood from India from April 2024.
What’s in today’s article?
Agarwood
About
CITES is an international agreement aimed at ensuring that international trade in wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.
It seeks to regulate and monitor the trade of endangered species of plants and animals to prevent their exploitation and ensure their long-term survival in the wild.
It was signed in 1973 by 184 parties. It entered into force in 1975.
Although CITES is
legally binding on the Parties
, it does not take the place of national laws.
Basically, CITES provides a legal framework to promote cooperation among its members, ensure sustainability, and regulate international trade.
Structure
The CITES Secretariat is administered by UNEP (The United Nations Environment Programme). It is located at Geneva, Switzerland.
The Conference of the Parties to CITES, is the supreme decision-making body of the Convention.
Three categories or appendices
CITES works by placing species into three categories or appendices, each offering a different level of protection:
Appendix I
: Includes species threatened with extinction. Trade in these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances.
Appendix II
: Includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction but for which trade must be controlled to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.
Appendix III
: Includes species that are protected in at least one country, which has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade.
Species can be added to or removed from Appendices I and II, or moved between them, only by the Conference of the Parties
However, species can be added to or removed from Appendix III at any time by any Party unilaterally.
Review of Significant Trade (RST) of the CITES
RST is a process, under the CITES, designed to ensure that trade in certain species is sustainable and does not threaten their survival.
Species are identified for review based on trade data, reports from member countries, or concerns raised by CITES scientific committees.
The status of these species is assessed to determine whether trade levels are sustainable and if they comply with CITES requirements.
If issues are identified, recommendations are made to the countries involved to improve management and conservation efforts.
These can include actions such as setting export quotas, improving legislation, or enhancing enforcement measures.
Aquilaria malaccensis, commonly known as agarwood, is a species of tree belonging to the
Thymelaeaceae family
It is well-known for producing a fragrant resinous wood, which is highly valued for its distinct aroma.
This resin forms in response to infection by a particular type of mold, and the resulting aromatic wood is known as agarwood, oud, or aloeswood.
Uses
Agarwood has been used for centuries in various cultures for religious, medicinal, and perfumery purposes. Some of its key uses include:
Perfumes and Incense
: Agarwood is highly prized in the perfume industry for its unique and long-lasting fragrance.
Traditional Medicine
: Agarwood is believed to have medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine for its potential to treat various ailments.
The essential oil extracted from agarwood has anti-inflammatory, anti-rheumatic, analgesic and anti-oxidant properties.
Spiritual Practices
: In many cultures, agarwood is used in spiritual rituals and meditation due to its calming and soothing properties.
Conservation Status
It was listed in Appendix II of CITES for the first time in 1995 based on India’s proposal at CoP9 in 1994.
i.e., While it is not immediately threatened with extinction, trade must be controlled to avoid exploitation that could threaten its survival.
Inclusion of agarwood in the RST of CITES prevented
India has successfully prevented inclusion of agarwood in the RST of the CITES.
This development is going to benefit lakhs of farmers in certain districts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Tripura.
Decision based on study by BSI
India's removal from the RST for Aquilaria malaccensis was achieved through a study conducted by the Botanical Survey of India (BSI) under the MoEFCC.
This study, known as a non-detriment finding (NDF), concluded that the species could be sustainably harvested under certain conditions.
Key points from the NDF include:
Restrictions
: Harvesting plants, collecting seeds, seedlings, saplings, and other propagules should not be allowed from existing wild populations, protected areas, and reserve forests.
Permitted Harvesting
: Harvesting should be allowed from home and community gardens, plantations on leased or patta lands, private or community plantations, and other small-scale or large-scale plantations.
Export Quotas
: The
NDF recommended an export quota for 2024–2027, allowing for 151,080 kg per year of agarwood chips and powder/sawdust and 7,050 kg per year of agarwood oil
Various restrictions affected trade in agarwood from India
The absence of an export quota for a long period and other trade-related restrictions in India caused an increase in informal trade/export of agar chips, oil, powder etc. to the Middle East and other foreign countries.
It also caused an increase in costs of agarwood chips and oil in the global market
as India is a major agarwood trading nation
Though India had an export quota since November 2021, the growers and farmers were unable to trade agarwood legally due to imposing several legal restrictions that led them towards informal traders.

**********Right to be Forgotten
Why in News?
The Supreme Court agreed to hear a case by online legal chronicler (Indian Kanoon), whose outcome will likely shape the contours of the “right to be forgotten”.
The online portal challenged a Madras HC order, which after reversing a trial court judgment convicting a person of sexual assault charges, had directed the portal to remove the conviction judgment.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Right to be Forgotten?
How is the 'Right to be Forgotten' Interpreted in India?
When can the ‘Right to be Forgotten’ be Asserted?
Questions to be Addressed by the SC in the ‘Right to be Forgotten’ Case
It is the right to have publicly available
personal information removed from the internet
, search engines, databases, websites or any other public platforms.
One can seek this right when their personal information is
no longer necessary or relevant
and the presence of his/her digital footprint violates their
right to privacy.
This right has been recognised as a statutory right in the
EU
(as “right to erasure”) under the General Data Protection Regulation (
GDPR
) and has been upheld by a number of courts in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.
Position in India:
In India, there is
no statutory framework
that prescribes the right to be forgotten.
However, the
Personal Data Protection Bill 2019
court rulings
have expressly recognised this right.
The Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill 2019:
The Bill gave an individual the right to restrict or prevent the continued disclosure of their personal data when such data -
Has served the purpose for which it was collected.
Was made with the individual's consent, which has since been withdrawn.
Was made contrary to the PDP Bill or any law in force.
The court rulings:
The SC in the landmark
KS Puttaswamy or Right to privacy judgement
(2017) recognised that the right to control his/her own life would also encompass his/her
right to control their existence on the internet.
Since the right to privacy verdict, high courts have taken a broader view of the issue.
For example
In 2019, the Delhi HC said the “right to be forgotten” and “right to be left alone” are
inherent aspects of the right to privacy.
In 2021, the Delhi HC extended the right to be forgotten to even a
criminal case
by ruling to take down search results relating to an American law student (acquitted in a customs case).
In 2020, the Orissa HC held that the right to be forgotten is a thorny issue in terms of practicality and technological nuances and
needs a widespread debate
The SC of India clarified in its right to privacy decision that -
An individual should be able to remove his/her personal data, if such data or information is
no longer necessary, relevant
incorrect and serves no legitimate interest.
cannot be exercised
where the information or data is
Necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression,
In compliance with legal obligations,
In public interest, etc.
The Delhi HC also noted that the
right to privacy should be balanced with the right to information of the public
and maintenance of transparency in judicial records.
Therefore, the issue underscores
the tension between the “right to be forgotten” of the acquitted person and citizens’ “right to be informed”
Questions to be Addressed by the SC in the ‘Right to be Forgotten’ Case:
The top court has to decide whether the right to be forgotten is
a fundamental right
and, if so,
how it relates to other fundamental rights

Two questions before the SC:
Can a person, upon reversal of his conviction in a criminal case by a higher court, demand erasure from the websites the earlier judgement that had convicted him/her?
Would a higher court that acquits an accused in a criminal case (by reversing the earlier judgement) be within its jurisdiction to order a web portal to expunge the earlier conviction judgement to honour the acquitted person’s right to be forgotten?

**********Surprising ‘dark oxygen’ discovery could ensnarl deep-sea mining    
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About Dark Oxygen
Mains level:
Impact of Deep-Sea Mining
Why in the news?
Scientists reported on July 22 in
Nature Geoscience
that an unknown process is generating oxygen in the deep oceans, where photosynthesis is not possible due to the lack of light.
About the recent study:
Discovery of Oxygen:
Scientists reported an unknown
process producing oxygen in the deep ocean, specifically in the abyssal zone,
where photosynthesis is not feasible due to insufficient sunlight.
Location of Study:
The study was conducted in the
Clarion-Clipperton Zone, located off Mexico’s west coast
, which is known for having the
highest concentration of polymetallic nodules.
Oxygen Measurement:
At a depth of 4 km, researchers observed unexpected increases in oxygen levels, sometimes tripling within two days, contrary to expectations of decreasing levels due to consumption by marine life.
Source of Oxygen:
The researchers hypothesized that
the oxygen could be generated by polymetallic nodules, which may create electric charges that split water molecules, releasing oxygen
. The nodules
exhibited voltages up to 0.95 V,
suggesting they could function like battery cells.
What is Deep-Sea Mining?
Deep-Sea Mining:
It involves
extracting minerals from the ocean floor at great depths
, targeting resources such as polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides, and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.
Economic and Strategic Importance of Deep-sea Mining:
Resource Potential:
The Clarion-Clipperton Zone holds substantial reserves, including
6 billion tonnes of manganese, and over 200 million tonnes each of copper and nickel,
making it a significant target for future mining operations.
International Contracts:
International Seabed Authority
has granted exploration contracts to various contractors, including the Government of India, for deep-sea mining activities.
What is Dark Oxygen?
“Dark oxygen” refers to the oxygen found in the deep ocean, specifically in regions where photosynthesis cannot occur due to the absence of sunlight. In such areas, known as the abyssal zone, oxygen levels are typically low and depend on global ocean circulation for replenishment.
Ecological Concerns:
Potential Damage:
The recent findings highlight the potential risks of deep-sea mining to unique marine ecosystems that depend on
‘dark oxygen’.
There is concern that mining could disrupt these ecosystems, leading to significant and possibly irreversible environmental impacts.
Historical Evidence:
Previous experiments, such as the
DISCOL Experiment,
have shown
long-term ecological damage from simulated mining activities
, including reduced biodiversity and altered sedimentological profiles.
Industry Response and Challenges:
Insurance Withdrawal:
In response to growing concerns, major
European insurance companies announced they would exclude deep-sea mining from their underwriting portfolios.
Sustainability Issues:
The new discovery of ‘dark oxygen’ adds complexity to the debate on deep-sea mining. If sustainable practices are not implemented,
such mining could become unfeasible due to its potential negative impacts on marine ecosystems.
Way forward:
Develop Comprehensive Environmental Regulations:
The Government should establish and enforce robust environmental regulations and impact assessment protocols for deep-sea mining.
Promote Sustainable Mining Practices:
Need to invest in research and innovation to develop and implement technologies and methods that minimize environmental impact.
Mains PYQ:
Coastal sand mining, whether legal or illegal, poses one of the biggest threats to our environment. Analyse the impact of sand mining along the Indian coasts, citing specific examples.

**********Should India focus on natural farming?    
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF)
Mains level:
Concerns related to Natural Farming
Why in the news?
In the 2024-25 Budget proposals, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman declared that
over the next two years, one crore farmers
nationwide will be introduced to
natural farming,
with support provided through certification and branding.
National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF):
The National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF) aims to
encourage farmers to adopt chemical-free farming practices and willingly shift to natural farming
based on the merits of the system.
The government believes the success of NMNF hinges on changing farmers’ behaviour to transition from chemical-based inputs to cow-based, locally-produced inputs, supported by a financial outlay of
₹4,645.69 crore over six years (2019-20 to 2024-25)
under the
‘Bharatiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhati’ scheme.
What is natural farming?
Natural farming
avoids the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides,
instead
promoting traditional indigenous practices.
It focuses on recycling
on-farm biomass,
employing
biomass mulching
, and utilizing formulations made from
cow dung and urine.
Pests are managed through
diverse farming practices
on-farm botanical mixtures
, strictly excluding all synthetic chemical inputs.
What are the concerns related to Yield?
Yield Reduction
: Agricultural experts are concerned that a large-scale transition to natural farming could result in reduced crop yields. Studies have shown
significant declines in yield
for staples like
wheat (59%)
basmati rice (32%)
compared to integrated crop management systems.
Food Security
: Lower yields from natural farming could
threaten food security in a populous country like India,
potentially only being able to feed around one-third of the population with staples like wheat and rice.
Findings on the Ground:
Mixed outcomes
: Field experiments have shown mixed results. Some studies indicate improved yields and incomes with lower costs due to biological inputs, while others show a decline in productivity.
Good Results in Andra Pradesh
: In Andhra Pradesh, adopting natural farming methods has shown promising results,
leading to better crop yields and enhanced farmers’ incomes.
Concerns about sustainability and productivity:
Agro-scientists from the
Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)
the Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research (IIFSR)
raised concerns about the sustainability and productivity of natural farming methods.
Differences in Studies:
CESS Study
: The
Centre for Economic and Social Studies (CESS)
Institute for Development Studies Andhra Pradesh
found that natural farming practices led to
improved yields and incomes for farmers
, thereby enhancing food and nutritional security.
ICAR-IIFSR Study
: The study by ICAR-IIFSR reported a significant
decline in yields of key crops like wheat and basmati rice when compared to conventional farming practices,
suggesting a negative impact on food supply.
Case study of Sri Lanka:
Policy Shift
: Sri Lanka’s decision to completely switch to organic farming and ban chemical fertilizers led to economic and political turmoil.
Yield Decline
: Farmers struggled to obtain natural fertilizers, resulting in reduced yields of key crops, including rice.
Food Security Risk
: The shift put the country’s food security at risk, causing sharp price escalations and widespread protests and unrest.
Way forward:
Localized Implementation and Scientific Validation
: Need to conduct rigorous
scientific studies and extensive field trials
to validate the productivity and viability of natural farming methods before scaling them up nationwide.
Hybrid Approach and Support for Farmers
: Govt. should adopt a
hybrid approach
that combines the best practices of both natural and conventional farming to ensure food security.
**********SC to examine acquitted man’s ‘right to be forgotten’: What is the right, and how have courts ruled earlier?    
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Right to be Forgotten
Mains level:
Key judgments related to the Right to be forgotten
Why in the news?
Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could define the scope of the “right to be forgotten” referred to in European privacy law as the “right to erasure” in India.
What is the Right to be Forgotten?
The right to be forgotten allows
individuals to remove or de-index their personal information from the internet
if it infringes on their right to privacy. It is based on the principle that
personal data should be removed when it is outdated, irrelevant, or no longer necessary.
Affirmed by the
Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)
“Google Spain case” (2014)
, which ruled that
search engines must remove data if it is inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive in light of the time elapsed.
Under the
EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
Article 17
describes the
right to erasure, reflecting the concept of informational self-determination.
How is the Right Interpreted in India?
Absence of Statutory Framework
: India lacks specific l
egislation explicitly addressing the right to be forgotten.
Judicial Interpretation
: The
2017
ruling in
Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India
recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right
. Justice S.K. Kaul’s concurring opinion suggested that the right to be forgotten involves
removing personal data that is no longer necessary or relevant.
Judicial Guidelines
: Justice Kaul outlined valid justifications for overriding this right, including freedom of expression, legal compliance, public interest, and research purposes.
How have Courts ruled on the Issue?
Rajagopal vs. State of Tamil Nadu (1994)
: The Supreme Court recognized a
“right to be let alone”
but differentiated it from public records, including court decisions.
Once something becomes public, privacy rights are diminished.
Dharamraj Bhanushankar Dave vs. State of Gujarat (2017)
: Gujarat HC
refused to remove details of an acquittal
, asserting that court orders should remain public.
The Registrar General (2017)
: Karnataka HC protected the
name of a petitioner in a sensitive annulment case
, aligning with trends in Western jurisdictions.
Delhi HC (2021)
Extended the right to be forgotten to criminal cases
, allowing details of an acquittal to be removed from search results to protect the petitioner’s career prospects.
Orissa HC (2020)
: Noted the
need for a broader debate on the right to be forgotten,
particularly concerning
“revenge porn”
online content.
Way forward:
Legislative Framework Development:
India should consider drafting
comprehensive legislation
explicitly addresses the right to be forgotten
, aligning with international standards while balancing privacy, freedom of expression, and public interest.
Judicial and Policy Clarity:
The Supreme Court’s upcoming ruling
should aim to establish a clear legal precedent on the right to be forgotten
, ensuring consistency across lower courts and aligning with global practices.
Mains PYQ:
Examine the scope of Fundamental Rights in the light of the latest judgement of the Supreme Court on the Right to Privacy.
**********CITES eases Export of Agarwood from India
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
India successfully prevented the inclusion of
Aquilaria malaccensis
(agarwood)
Review of Significant Trade (RST)
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
CITES notified a new export quota for Aquilaria malaccensis from India, effective April 2024.
What is Agarwood?
Agarwood (the
Wood of Gods
) also known as “
Oud
,” is a highly valuable and
aromatic resinous wood
produced by the
Aquilaria tree
The resin
forms in the heartwood
of the tree when it
becomes infected with a particular type of mold
(Phialophora parasitica).
This
infection causes the tree to produce a dark, fragrant resin
, which is highly sought after for its distinctive aroma.
This contains
essential oils
with compounds like
sesquiterpenes, chromones, and phenylethyl chromone derivatives.
It thrives in
tropical forests
, at
altitudes up to 1000 meters
, often found in areas with
high humidity and rainfall
Conservation Status:
IUCN Status
: Listed as
Critically Endangered
: Listed in
Appendix II
in 1995 based on India’s proposal at CoP9 in
1994
Uses of Agarwood
It is traditionally used as
incense
Extracts (agarwood oil) are used in
perfumes
, the aroma industry, medicine, air fresheners, and purifiers.
Essential oil has
anti-inflammatory, anti-rheumatic, analgesic
, and anti-oxidant properties.
What is the issue over the inclusion of ‘Agarwood’ (Aquilaria malaccensis) in the RST of the CITES list?
Aquilaria malaccensis was listed in Appendix II of CITES in 1995, which means its
trade is controlled to avoid utilization incompatible
with its survival.
The RST process assesses whether
trade in a species is detrimental to its survival
and recommends actions to ensure sustainability.
India’s stance
was supported by a
study conducted by the Botanical Survey of India (BSI)
, which suggested that the
harvest from wild populations should be prohibited
, while allowing harvest from plantations and private/community lands.
Arguments against Inclusion in RST
Controlled Harvesting
: India argued that it has established controlled harvesting practices, ensuring that only cultivated agarwood is used for trade.
Economic Impact
: Inclusion in the RST could have disrupted the livelihoods of farmers and traders who depend on agarwood cultivation, particularly in the northeastern states of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Tripura.
Sustainable Practices
: The NDF indicated that the current practices in India were sustainable and that the species was being cultivated widely, reducing pressure on wild populations.
New Export Quota
Establishment of Quota
: CITES notified a new export quota for agarwood from India, effective from April 2024. The quota was set at 1,51,080 kg/year for agarwood chips and powder/sawdust, and 7,050 kg/year for agarwood oil.
Formal Trade
: The absence of an export quota for a long period had led to informal trade and increased prices. The new quota aims to regulate and legalize the trade, ensuring benefits to local growers and the economy.
Significance for Farmers
Agarwood cultivation is prevalent in parts of India, especially in the
Northeast
This development will benefit lakhs of farmers in districts of

**********Himachal witnesses gradual Snowfall Pattern Shift  
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Shift in snowfall patterns in Himachal, Rivers and glaciers located
Why in the News?
Himachal Pradesh is experiencing a reducing snow cover over the years.
There is a noticeable shift in snowfall occurrence from winter months towards early summer months.
Findings from the Latest Study:
The study by the Centre on Climate Change of
Himachal Pradesh Council for Science Technology-Environment (HIMCOSTE)
shows an overall
decrease of 12.72% in snow cover area
in 2023-24 compared to 2022-23.
The study used
Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) satellite data
to analyze snow cover trends.
Early winter months
(October-November) showed a decrease in snow cover area
except for the Ravi basin
, which showed a marginal increase in October.
Peak winter months
(December-January) saw a
negative trend
in snow cover area.
Late winter months
(February-March) showed a
positive trend with an increase
in snow cover area in all basins compared to the previous year.
Snow cover area increased in April
due to fresh snowfall in the early summer period.
Impact on Water Availability
The decrease in snow cover
during peak winter months
(December and January) is especially alarming.
Snowfall during these months sustains longer and
enhances the discharge dependability of major river basins during summer.
Reduced snow cover in winter
could affect water availability
during the summer months.
Concerns and Implications
Environmentalists and scientists are concerned about the shifting snowfall patterns.
Depleting snow cover and changing snowfall patterns have
significant impacts on hydro-power, water sources, people, livestock, forests
, farms, and infrastructure.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Indexation, Capital Gains Tax Regime.
Why in the News?
The
withdrawal of the
indexation
benefit from the
long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax regime
has emerged as a contentious decision in the Union Budget for 2024-25.
What is Indexation?
Indexation is a method used
to adjust the purchase price of an asset
to account for inflation over the period it was held.
This
reduces the taxable capital gain
, as it
reflects the increase in the asset’s value due to inflation
Purpose:
To ensure that the taxpayers are taxed only on the real gains and not on the inflationary increase in the value of the asset.
Changes in the LTCG Regime
The new LTCG regime
removes the indexation benefi
property, gold, and other unlisted assets
The LTCG tax rate is
reduced from 20% to 12.5%.
For
assets purchased before 2001
fair market value
as of April 1, 2001, is considered the cost of acquisition.
Implications of the Changes
The government claims the changes
simplify the capital gains tax structure
without causing a loss to most taxpayers.
The uniform tax rate for various asset classes is
intended to benefit both taxpayers and tax authorities
Concerns for Taxpayers
There was significant concern, particularly in the
residential real estate sector
, about increased LTCG tax liabilities.
The government clarified that the
new regime would be beneficial in most cases
, as real estate returns typically outpace inflation.
The Income Tax Department explained that:
properties held for 5 years
