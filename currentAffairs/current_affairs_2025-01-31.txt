What is Leprosy?
World Leprosy Day is observed on January 30 every year to make people aware of leprosy and remove the misconceptions spread in society.
About Leprosy:
Leprosy, also known as
Hansen’s disease,
is a
chronic infectious diseas
e caused by a type of bacteria,
Mycobacterium leprae.
The disease predominantly
affects the skin and peripheral nerves.
Left untreated,
the disease may cause progressive and
permanent disabilities.
Apart from the physical deformity, persons affected by leprosy also
face stigmatization
and discrimination.
It is a
neglected tropical disease (NTD)
that still occurs in more than 120 countries, with more than 200,000 new cases reported each year.
It is known to
occur at all ages,
ranging from early childhood to old age.
Transmission
The disease is transmitted
through droplets
from the nose and mouth
of an untreated case
of leprosy, containing the causative agent,
following prolonged, close contact.
does not spread through casual contact
(like shaking hands or hugging, sharing meals or sitting next to each other).
The patient stops transmitting the disease upon initiation of treatment.
Symptoms:
It usually takes about
3 to 5 years for symptoms to appear
after you come into contact with the bacteria that cause leprosy.
The main symptom of leprosy is
disfiguring skin sores, lumps, or bumps
that don’t go away after several weeks or months.
In some cases,
body parts may lose their sense of touch and pain,
increasing the likelihood of injuries such as cuts and burns.
Treatment:
Leprosy is a
curable disease.
The currently recommended treatment regimen consists of three medicines (dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine) and is referred to as
multi-drug therapy (MDT).

**********What is a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)?
As many as six firms will develop Indian foundational Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using newly provisioned Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) by the IndiaAI Mission, Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology announced recently.
About Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):
A GPU is an
electronic circuit board
that can
quickly perform many mathematical calculations.
Like a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a GPU is also a
chip component in computing devices.
The technology was
originally designed to speed up 3-D graphics rendering.
Since its introduction in the 1990s, the GPU has transformed computer software and video games, allowing programmers to produce vivid and realistic images on screens.
More recently, GPUs have been used beyond computer graphics in areas including
high-performance computing, machine learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI), weather forecasting and cryptocurrency mining.
CPU vs. GPU:
CPUs
are designed to handle general-purpose tasks such as
running applications and managing system resources.
On the other hand,
are optimized for specific tasks such as rendering
3D graphics and video decoding.
CPUs have fewer cores than GPUs, but each core is capable of handling more complex instructions.
This means that CPUs can handle sequential tasks more efficiently than GPUs, but GPUs outperform CPUs when it comes to parallel tasks like image rendering or video encoding/decoding.

**********Key Facts about Point Nemo
Two young women officers of the Indian Navy onboard the sailing vessel INSV Tarini recently crossed Point Nemo in the southern Pacific as a part of their efforts to circumnavigate the globe under Navika Sagar Parikrama-II.
About Point Nemo:
Point Nemo, also known as the
Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility,
holds the distinction of being the
farthest point from any landmass on Earth.
This remote point lies in the
South Pacific Ocean
and is named after Captain Nemo, the sailor from Jules Verne’s famous novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.
Situated approximately
2,688 km from the nearest landmass,
this isolated point is famous for its extreme remoteness, with
the closest human presence often being aboard the International Space Station
orbiting above.
The

To the north lies
Ducie Island,
Pitcairn Islands (British Overseas Territory).
To the northeast is
Motu Nui
, one of the
Easter Islands
(Chilean dependency).
To the south is
Maher Island, part of Antarctica.
Due to its isolation, the waters around Point Nemo have
very little marine life,
and the region
falls within the South Pacific Gyre
, known for having some of the clearest and least biologically active ocean waters.
Due to its remoteness and relative lack of marine traffic, Point Nemo has become a popular location for space agencies to dispose of space junk.

**********What is the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR)?
The Enforcement Directorate recently informed the Kerala High Court that 18 ECIRs (Enforcement Case Information Reports) have been registered against cooperative banks/societies in Kerala to investigate money laundering in connection with financial irregularities.
About Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR):
The ECIR is a
formal entry of the complaint lodged by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).
It serves as a starting point for ED's proceedings, including the attachment of assets and arrests.
There is no mention of the ECIR in the
Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002
(PMLA Act) or Rules.
However, as per the practice of ED, the ECIR is lodged before taking any action under the PMLA Act.
The ECIR under the PMLA Act is similar to the First Information Report (FIR) lodged by the Police for cognizable offences.
However, the
Supreme Court held that ECIR cannot be equated with an FIR.
As per the ED,
ECIR is a document meant for the identification of a particular case and for departmental convenience and is
purely an internal document
ED is
not legally bound
to provide a

**********Household Consumption Expenditure Survey
Recently, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) published the summary findings of the second of the two consecutive surveys on household consumption expenditure survey.
About
Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES):
It is designed to collect information on the consumption and expenditure of
households on goods and services.
The survey provides data required to assess trends in economic well-being and to determine and update the basket of consumer goods and services and weights used for the calculation of the Consumer Price Index. Data collected in HCES is also used to
measure poverty, inequality and social exclusion.
Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure
(MPCE) compiled from HCES is the primary indicator used for
most analytical purposes.
Key Highlights of the Survey
There is a persistent
decline in urban-rural consumption difference
across India’s major States continues in 2023-24.
average MPCE is on the rise
across all Household types in rural and urban Areas.
Among 18 major states, the difference between urban and rural average monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) of households is the lowest in Kerala, followed by Punjab, Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Bihar.

**********Controlled Cannabis Cultivation
Recently, the Himachal Pradesh Cabinet approved a pilot study by two universities on the controlled cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and industrial purposes.
About
Controlled Cannabis Cultivation:
It is the
regulated cultivation of specific cannabis varieties
having minimal intoxicating properties, along with strict monitoring to prevent misuse. Such varieties are commonly known as
The
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
cannabinoid content (a kind of chemical that has an intoxicating effect) in controlled cannabis should be less than or equal to
3 per cent.
Under this, authorities focus on its non-narcotic applications, particularly in the pharmaceutical and industrial sectors.
Uses of Hemp:
Hemp’s stalks, leaves, and seeds can also be converted into textile, paper, food, cosmetics, biofuel and more. Additionally,
cannabidiol
(CBD) compounds in the plant are effective in
treating chronic pain.
Laws related to cannabis cultivation in India
Cannabis cultivation is
largely prohibited
in India due to its
psychoactive properties.
Section 2 of the
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985
, prohibits the production and sale of cannabis resin and flowers.
It defines charas as the separated resin, in any form (crude or purified), obtained from the cannabis plant. It also includes concentrated preparations such as hashish oil or liquid hashish.
However, it provides exceptions for cannabis cultivation and use for
industrial and medicinal purposes under government regulation
Section 10 of the Act allows state governments to regulate, permit, or prohibit cannabis cultivation for medicinal and scientific purposes.
Section 14
grants the Central government the power to authorise and regulate cannabis cultivation for research or other approved purposes.

**********Human African Trypanosomiasis
Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Guinea has successfully eliminated the gambiense form of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) as a public health problem.
About
Human African Trypanosomiasis:
It is a
parasitic disease
transmitted through the
bite of infected tsetse flies.
It is also known as
sleeping sickness
and is endemic in
sub-Saharan Africa.
Symptoms:
It initially presents with symptoms such as
fever, headaches, and joint pain
, but can progress to neurological issues like confusion, disrupted sleep, and behavioural changes. If left untreated, the disease can be fatal.
First signs and symptoms emerge a few weeks or months after infection. The disease develops rapidly with
multi-organ invasion, including the brain.
It takes 2 forms, depending on the subspecies of the infecting parasite:
Trypanosoma brucei gambiense:
It is found in 24 countries of west and central Africa, currently accounts for 92% of reported cases and causes a chronic illness.
A person can be infected for months or even years without major signs or symptoms. When evident symptoms emerge, often the disease is advanced with the central nervous system already affected.
Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense:
It is found in 13 countries of eastern and southern Africa accounts for 8% of reported cases and causes an acute disease.

**********Supreme Court relaxes condition for appointment of ad hoc judges to HCs
Why in news?
The Supreme Court has eased its previous condition for appointing
in High Courts to clear pending criminal cases.
It ruled that ad hoc appointments can be made even if vacancies do not exceed 20% of the sanctioned strength.
The 20% condition was imposed by the Supreme Court in an April 2021 judgment in the
Lok Prahari versus Union of India
case.
What’s in today’s article?
Article 224A: Appointment of Retired Judges in High Courts
Condition for appointment of ad hoc judges to HCs relaxed
The Chief Justice of a High Court, with the
President’s prior consent
, can request a retired judge of that or any other High Court to serve as a judge in that state’s High Court.
Such judges will have
the same jurisdiction, powers, and privileges
as regular judges but will not be considered permanent judges.
Their allowances will be determined by the
President’s order
In Lok Prahari v. Union of India (2021), the Supreme Court
invoked Article 224-A
of the Constitution to allow the appointment of ad hoc judges in High Courts to address the backlog of cases.
It set guidelines ensuring such appointments occur only after efforts to fill regular vacancies.
The Chief Justice of a High Court may exercise this discretion if:
vacancies exceed 20% of the sanctioned strength,
cases in a category have been pending for over five years,
over 10% of pending cases are older than five years, or
the disposal rate is lower than the rate of new case filings.
The Supreme Court has allowed High Courts across India to appoint retired judges on an ad-hoc basis to address the backlog of criminal cases.
These judges will only hear criminal appeals in benches headed by a sitting High Court judge.
Guidelines for Appointment
A special bench comprising Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant ruled that:
Chief Justices of High Courts can recommend retired judges for appointment.
Each High Court may appoint
2 to 5 ad-hoc judges
, not exceeding
10% of its sanctioned strength
Modification of Earlier Conditions
The Supreme Court modified and kept in abeyance certain conditions set in its April 2021 ruling by then CJI SA Bobde, including:
The earlier requirement that vacancies should not exceed
20% of sanctioned strength
before appointing ad-hoc judges.
The restriction that ad-hoc judges
could sit separately on benches
to deal with cases.
No Fixed Timeline for Appointments
The Supreme Court declined a request to set a fixed timeline for appointing ad-hoc judges but emphasized that the process should begin immediately.
Addressing the Pendency Crisis
ruling was prompted by the acute backlog of cases
The High Courts have over 60 lakh cases pending, of which nearly 20 lakh are criminal appeals.
The 80% working strength condition from the 2021 ruling had prevented ad-hoc appointments in several High Courts, such as Allahabad HC (80 judges out of 160 sanctioned strength).

**********Mahakumbh Stampede: Understanding the Causes and Strategies for Prevention
Why in news?
A stampede at the Mahakumbh Mela in Allahabad on January 29 claimed several lives. UP CM attributed the tragedy to the overwhelming crowd gathering for Mauni Amavasya.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had in 2014 published a report on crowd management at big events and prevention of stampedes. The report said, “
Majority of the crowd disasters in India and developing countries have occurred at religious places
.”
What’s in today’s article?
Causes of Stampedes
Role of Crowd Behaviour in Stampedes
Past Stampede Incidents
Proactive Planning for Crowd Control
Importance of Infrastructure and Information in Crowd Control
Stampedes can result from multiple factors, including structural weaknesses (poor barricading, weak guardrails, narrow exits, inadequate lighting), fire or electrical failures, poor crowd control, and lack of coordination among stakeholders.
Failures in Crowd Control
The NDMA report highlights key reasons for crowd control failures, such as:
Underestimation of expected crowd size
Exceeding venue capacity
Limited holding areas before entry
Locked or closed exits
Weak railings and lack of queue management
Absence of sectoral partitions to regulate movement
Consequences of Poor Management
Inadequate arrangements often trigger panic or excitement, leading to overcrowding or rapid movement.
This, in turn, results in crushing, suffocation, and trampling.
The report identifies compressive asphyxia as the leading cause of fatalities in such disasters.
Understanding crowd behaviour is crucial for preventing stampedes.
The actions of a few individuals can influence many, sometimes leading to panic or disorder.
A community-based approach to crowd control is more effective than force-based methods.
Impact of Overcrowding
At many events, demand exceeds available space, leading to overcrowding.
To manage this,
input control
—such as restricting entry through a mandatory registration process—can help regulate the crowd.
Risks of Poor Crowd Management
Long wait times may prompt individuals to climb fences, causing others to follow and leading to congestion in another area.
Additionally, poorly executed control measures, such as police chasing unruly groups toward an incoming crowd, can create dangerous collisions, worsening the situation.
The NDMA report references several past stampedes, including:
Nashik Kumbh (August 2003):
29 pilgrims died due to overcrowding at barricades, sudden reverse crowd flow, sadhus moving in procession with pilgrims, and unforeseen influx of pilgrims at various points.
Kalubai Yatra Mandhardevi (January 2005):
293 people were killed due to wrong crowd estimates, inadequate temple space, narrow, slippery paths with illegal vendors, lack of safety measures, and poor infrastructure.
Causes Identified in Investigations
Nashik Kumbh:
The stampede was triggered by crowd pressure at barricades and the unplanned movement of pilgrims and sadhus.
Kalubai Yatra:
Causes included inaccurate crowd estimates, narrow paths, illegal activities, lack of safety and medical facilities, and poor coordination between stakeholders.
The NDMA report stresses that most stampedes can be avoided with proactive planning and effective execution. It outlines a
holistic approach
that includes:
Controlling the crowd inflow
Regulating the crowd within the venue
Managing the crowd outflow
Understanding Demand and Supply
To manage demand, authorities must analyze:
Historical crowd data
Arrival patterns and peak times (e.g., festivals, holidays)
Advance registration and ticketing systems
Public transport schedules
For supply management, the venue's capacity must be calculated to avoid overcrowding.
Role of Online Registration
Examples from Vaishnodevi and Sabarimala show that
online registration
can help manage crowd arrivals and influence patterns.
Dealing with Limited Supply Capacity
In places where increasing supply is not feasible due to religious beliefs or geography, authorities should focus on making waiting times more comfortable for visitors.
The report highlights the need for
adequate infrastructure
for crowd management at religious sites.
It recommends setting up
staging points
for visitors, equipped with necessary facilities like rest areas, food, water, and hygiene. These points should be monitored effectively.
The report also emphasizes the role of
information management
and the need for effective
dissemination of information
to guide visitors and maintain order.

**********The Yamuna Crisis - Beyond Politics
Context:
The issue of the
Yamuna river’s contamination
has turned into a
political controversy
, with Ex. Delhi Chief Minister accusing Haryana of polluting Delhi’s water supply.
As legal battles ensue and the Election Commission intervenes, it is essential to
examine the health of the Yamuna beyond political rhetoric.
Key Issues Related to the Yamuna:
Three major concerns regarding the Yamuna and Delhi's water supply are:
Drinking Water Supply
Pollution
Environmental Flow
Drinking Water Supply:
The supply challenges:
Delhi's drinking water comes primarily from
, with major inlets at Wazirabad Barrage, which depends on releases from Haryana’s Hathni Kund Barrage.
Delhi’s treatment plants (Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Okhla, Haiderpur, and Bawana) rely entirely on Haryana’s water supply.
Water shortages
arise during
lean seasons
, forcing plant shutdowns and leading to supply of untreatable water and water scarcity crisis.
The ammonia issue in Delhi’s water:
Ammonia, a colorless gas with a sharp odor, dissolves in water and is widely used in industries, fertilizers, and cleaning agents.
It enters water bodies through
industrial effluents, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage.
High ammonia levels in the Yamuna, caused by industrial discharge from
Panipat
Sonipat
and sewage from colonies, impact water quality by reducing
dissolved oxygen
Water treatment plants in Delhi
cannot process ammonia levels above 1 part per million (ppm)
, leading to disruptions in the capital’s water supply.
How is ammonia-laden water treated?
The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) uses
chlorine
to neutralize ammonia in water treatment plants.
Approximately 11.5 kg of chlorine is needed per litre of water per hour to counteract one ppm of ammonical nitrogen.
Efficiency of treatment plants
drops in winter due to increased ammonia levels.
Government actions on ammonia contamination:
A long-term solution has yet to be implemented by Delhi and Haryana governments.
In March 2023, Delhi proposed an
in-situ ammonia treatment plant
at Wazirabad, but it remains under development.
Haryana has not completed laying pipelines to prevent pollutant mixing in the river.
Pollution - A Lingering Threat:
Apart from ammonia contamination,
multiple factors contribute to Yamuna’s pollution:
Unregulated sewage discharge:
Sewage flows into stormwater drains due to incomplete sewer connections in unauthorized colonies.
Industrial waste:
Unlicensed household industries discharge untreated effluents.
Solid waste dumping:
Illegal dumping continues despite regulations.
Key findings and unfulfilled commitments:
The National Green Tribunal’s
Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC)
(2018–2021) identified
16 major polluters
, including Delhi Jal Board and authorities from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.
The Najafgarh, Supplementary, and Shahdara drains are major contributors to pollution.
Haryana had committed to setting up Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) but failed to implement them fully.
Delhi’s Interceptor Project
aimed at treating sewage before discharge has seen partial success but remains ineffective due to incomplete execution.
Environmental Flow - The Need for Sustained Water Levels:
The National Institute of Hydrology (
NIH
) study highlighted that
excessive water withdrawals
upstream
drastically reduce Yamuna’s flow through Delhi.
Reduced flow
increases pollutant
concentration and disrupts aquatic life.
The YMC recommended revisiting the 1994 water-sharing agreement between Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh for fairer water distribution.
Regulatory intervention
by the central government or courts is necessary to ensure a sustainable environmental flow.
Conclusion - The Need for Political Will and Action:
While reports and recommendations exist,
implementation remains weak due to political and bureaucratic inertia.
Unless policymakers, engineers, and administrators take decisive action, neither political promises nor manifestos will have any real impact.
Citizens must recognize the gravity of the crisis and
demand accountability
to ensure the Yamuna’s
restoration and sustainable management

Editorial Analysis
**********An Opportunity to Settle Sri Lanka’s Ethnic Problem
Context
India's decision to name the Jaffna Cultural Centre after the Tamil poet
-philosopher Thiruvalluvar is a symbolic move that
underscores its deep historical and cultural ties with Sri Lanka.
This
gesture not only acknowledges the Tamil heritage but also serves as a diplomatic tool to reinforce India's influence in Sri Lanka
, particularly among the Tamil-speaking population.
However, beyond the cultural significance,
the relationship between the two nations has been shaped by decades of political complexities,
particularly regarding the Tamil issue and the implementation of the
13th Amendment (13A) to Sri Lanka’s Constitution.
Historical and Political Context of 13
Amendment and India’s Stance
India’s involvement in Sri Lanka’s Tamil issue dates back to the
1983 anti-Tamil pogrom,
which
led to its role as a mediator
and later as an active player in resolving the ethnic conflict.
This culminated in the
Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987
which resulted in the 13th Amendment
, introducing
Provincial Councils with limited autonomy.
However, the
amendment has remained a contentious issue
, facing resistance from both Sinhalese nationalist groups and Tamil separatist forces.
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP),
the party of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has
traditionally opposed 13A, viewing it as an imposition by India.
Similarly, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE
), though advocating Tamil autonomy,
rejected the amendment as inadequate.
India’s Stance on the 13th Amendment
Despite over 35 years since its introduction,
the full implementation of 13A remains elusive, especially in Tamil-majority areas.
Successive Indian governments
have consistently
urged Sri Lanka to implement the amendment fully.
recent developments, such as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s omission of any direct mention of 13A
during Sri Lankan President Dissanayake’s visit in December 2024,
have raised questions about whether India is shifting its stance.
While Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar reiterated India’s call for devolution, Modi’s silence suggests a possible recalibration of India's approach, potentially influenced by Sri Lanka’s evolving domestic politics.
Sri Lanka’s Political Landscape and Devolution Debate
The JVP and the NPP’s Stance on Devolution
A critical factor shaping the debate on devolution today is the stance of the JVP, a left-wing nationalist party that has historically opposed 13A.
The party,
which played a significant role in two armed uprisings (in 1971 and 1987-89),
viewed the Indo-Lanka Accord and its resulting constitutional amendment as an
infringement on Sri Lanka’s sovereignty.
This position has persisted even as the JVP evolved into a mainstream political force.
Currently,
the JVP leads the National People’s Power (NPP) coalition
, which has emerged as a dominant political force in Sri Lanka.
who hails from the JVP,
has not explicitly stated whether his government will fully implement 13A.
During his 2024 parliamentary election campaign in Jaffna,
he largely avoided discussing the issues of power devolution and a political settlement for the Tamils
, raising concerns that his administration may not prioritize Tamil autonomy.
The Ambiguity in the NPP’s Constitutional Promises
NPP’s 2024 election manifesto promised to draft a new constitution
that strengthens democracy and ensures equality for all citizens.
it did not explicitly mention greater autonomy for the Tamil-majority Northern and Eastern provinces.
Instead,
it proposed a "devolution of political and administrative power to every local government, district, and province
", suggesting a broader but less concrete approach to decentralisation.
manifesto also committed to holding provincial and local government elections within a year
, a crucial step given that provincial councils have been defunct since 2019.
it remains unclear whether these elections will lead to meaningful devolution or if they will merely reinforce existing administrative structures
without addressing Tamil political demands.
The Risk of Local Government Supplanting Provincial Councils
One of the key debates in Sri Lanka’s devolution discourse is
whether local government bodies can serve as an alternative to provincial councils.
Local bodies, such as municipal and district councils, have a much longer history in Sri Lanka than provincial councils and are responsible for grassroots governance.
they lack the financial and administrative capacity
to address broader regional challenges,
particularly in the Tamil-majority areas,
which continue to struggle with post-war reconstruction and economic underdevelopment.
The fear among many Tamil leaders is that the government may prioritise strengthening local government institutions while ignoring provincial councils
, thereby sidestepping the core issue of regional autonomy.
Unlike provincial councils, which were established as a direct outcome of 13A,
local bodies function under a different administrative framework with limited powers.
If the government focuses only on local bodies
without empowering provincial councils,
Tamil aspirations for meaningful self-governance may remain unfulfilled.
The Role of Sinhalese Nationalism in the Devolution Debate
The broader devolution debate in Sri Lanka is also influenced by
Sinhalese nationalist sentiment,
opposes granting more autonomy to Tamil-majority regions.
Many nationalist groups fear that
implementing 13A fully—especially provisions related to land and police powers—could lead to a gradual push for separatism.
sentiment has historically shaped government policies
, leading to reluctance in implementing devolution measures despite repeated Indian diplomatic pressure.
The Way Forward: Towards a Durable Solution
For Sri Lanka to achieve long-term stability and reconciliation,
the ruling coalition must recognize that the Provincial Councils
are not merely an Indian creation but a product of Sri Lanka’s own political evolution.
The country’s constitutional framework has historically drawn from global models,
including British, American, and French systems.
Therefore,
dismissing 13A as an external imposition overlooks its potential to provide a democratic solution
to the ethnic conflict.
With a two-thirds majority in Parliament and a popular President
, the NPP has a unique opportunity to enact meaningful reforms.
A balanced approach that respects the aspirations of the Tamil population
while maintaining national unity is essential.
Implementing the full provisions of 13A, including holding provincial council elections, would be a significant step
in addressing Tamil grievances and reinforcing Sri Lanka’s democratic credentials.
Conclusion
India’s decision to rename the Jaffna Cultural Centre after Thiruvalluvar symbolises its commitment to cultural diplomacy
and its historical ties with Sri Lanka, however, the deeper issue of Tamil political rights remains unresolved.
The 13th Amendment, despite its flaws
, remains the most
viable framework for addressing Tamil aspirations
within a united Sri Lanka.
While India’s stance on the issue may be evolving,
Sri Lanka’s leadership must recognise that meaningful devolution is not merely a diplomatic obligation but a necessity
for national harmony.

**********The Science is Clear, Crowd Disasters Are Preventable
Context
recent disaster at the Maha Kumbh in India,
which claimed 30 lives, is
another reminder of the dangers posed by high-density crowds.
Despite scientific research offering clear solutions,
local governments and event organisers often fail to take the necessary precautions.
Therefore,
it is important to explore the causes of crowd crushes, examines their global impact, stricter regulations
and better crowd management strategies to prevent future tragedies.
The Science Behind Crowd Crushes and Similar Past Incidents
Crowd crushes occur when
too many people are compressed into a confined space
, increasing the density beyond safe limits.
Research shows that
injuries begin occurring at a density of five people per square meter
, while a density of seven people per square meter or more can lead to severe injuries or fatalities.
This is because,
at such high densities, individuals lose the ability to control their movements
, and breathing itself can become difficult.
recent Maha Kumbh disaster is a textbook example
of how crowd density can spiral out of control.
Reports suggest that
a large crowd formed behind a barrier, leading to intense pressure on those at the front.
When movement is restricted,
even minor disturbances, such as pushing or sudden shifts in direction, can trigger a deadly crush.
Similar Incidents
Similar incidents have occurred worldwide, including the
2021 Astroworld concert in Houston, the 2022 Itaewon Halloween tragedy in South Korea, the 2023 Yemen charity distribution stampede,
and the 2024 religious festival disaster in Nigeria.
These examples
highlight the widespread nature of the problem
and emphasize the need for proactive crowd management strategies.
Misconceptions Surrounding Crowd Crush Incidents and Economic Incentives Behind the Inaction
The Myth of Crowd Behaviour as the Cause
Historically,
people have believed that
crowd crushes are caused by panic, with individuals recklessly pushing and trampling others
in an attempt to escape.
However,
scientific studies on crowd dynamics have consistently debunked this notion.
In reality,
crowd crushes occur due to extreme density
, not panic or aggression.
When too many people are forced into a small space, physical movement becomes restricted, and individuals lose their ability to control their own actions.
At this point,
even minor pressure from behind—whether intentional or not—can cause people at the front to be squeezed against barriers
, walls, or other individuals, leading to asphyxiation and fatal injuries.
Furthermore,
once a crowd reaches a critical density, people inside the mass are unable to see or understand what is happening
around them.
Even if they sense danger,
they may have no way to escape or influence the movement of the crowd.
This is why crowd crushes often occur even in calm settings
, such as religious pilgrimages, where there is no aggressive or reckless behaviour.
The Economic Incentives Behind Inaction
Despite the clear benefits of proper crowd management,
many event organisers fail to implement these strategies.
A major reason for this
is financial incentive
Large-scale events
, whether concerts, religious gatherings, or sports matches,
generate significant revenue
through ticket sales, concessions, and merchandise.
Organisers often have a vested interest
in packing as many people as possible into a venue to maximize profits.
Implementing safety measures
, such as limiting attendance, expanding venue space, or hiring trained crowd managers,
is often seen as an unnecessary expense.
Governments also share some of the blame.
In many countries, there are no strict regulations
requiring event organisers to follow best practices for crowd safety
As a result,
safety measures are often left to the discretion of private promoters
, who may prioritise cost-cutting over public safety.
Without legal mandates and strict enforcement,
profit-driven decision-making can put thousands of lives at risk.
Key Actions to Prevent Dangerous Crowd Densities
Venue Design and Capacity Management
Ensuring that
event spaces are designed to accommodate the expected number of attendees
without creating choke points, bottlenecks, or dead ends.
Calculating crowd capacity based on scientifically proven density limits is essential.
Sufficient Entry and Exit Points
Having enough
well-spaced entry and exit routes prevents dangerous congestion.
Restricted or blocked exits have been a major factor in past crowd disasters, trapping people in deadly situations.
Staggered Arrivals and Departures
Large crowds do not necessarily have to move all at once.
Organisers can schedule staggered entry and exit times
, reducing the likelihood of mass surges at any given moment.
Real-Time Crowd Monitoring
Using surveillance cameras, drones, and other monitoring technologies can help organisers track crowd density and respond to potential dangers before they escalate.
Crowd Segmentation Strategies
Dividing large crowds into smaller, controlled sections can significantly reduce the risk of dangerous surges.
New York City’s Times Square New Year’s Eve celebration is a prime example,
where barriers segment the crowd into smaller groups, making it easier to manage.
The Way Forward: Shifting Responsibility to Where It Belongs
Instead of blaming individuals for ‘chaotic behaviour’ in crowd crush incidents,
governments and the public must hold event organisers accountable.
Authorities must enforce strict safety regulations
, requiring all large events to implement proven crowd management techniques.
Penalties for negligence should be severe enough to deter reckless planning
, and event permits should be contingent on organizers demonstrating clear safety protocols.
Conclusion
The loss of life at the Maha Kumbh,
like so many other crowds crush incidents,
was not an accident but a preventable failure of planning and regulation.
Scientific research has made it clear how and why these disasters occur
, yet event organisers and governments continue to ignore basic safety measures.
Until authorities take proactive steps
to enforce proper crowd management,
these tragedies will continue to claim innocent lives.
Only through strict regulations, better planning,
and a commitment to safety, we
can prevent future crowd crush disasters.

**********[31st January 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: An opportunity to settle Sri Lanka’s ethnic problem
International Relations
PYQ Relevance:
) ‘India is an age-old friend of Sri Lanka.’ Discuss India’s role in the recent crisis in Sri Lanka in the light of the preceding statement.
(UPSC CSE 2022)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
India is an age-old friend of Sri Lanka (2022),
and
India — Sri Lanka relations
’ (2013).
Over the past 40 years, India’s role in Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict evolved from mediator to active player, leading to the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord and the 13th Amendment, which introduced Provincial Councils. The JVP opposed it, calling it an Indian imposition. The LTTE also rejected it and demanded a separate Tamil Eelam, which India never supported.
Today’s editorial talks about the India Srilanka relation. This content would help in GS Paper 2 International relations.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Recently, India’s decision to name the Jaffna Cultural Centre after Tamil poet-philosopher Thiruvalluvar is a symbolic way to strengthen its deep ties with Sri Lanka.
What are the historical roots of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka?
Colonial Legacy
: British colonial rule (1815-1948) favoured the Tamil minority in administration and education, causing resentment among the Sinhalese majority.
Sinhala-Only Act (1956)
: The official adoption of Sinhala as the sole national language marginalized Tamil speakers and led to widespread Tamil discontent.
Discrimination in Education & Employment
: Policies like the standardization of university admissions (1970s) made it harder for Tamils to access higher education and government jobs.
Ethnic Violence & Riots
: The 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom (Black July) led to mass violence against Tamils, intensifying the demand for Tamil autonomy.
Rise of the LTTE
: The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) emerged as the dominant militant group demanding an independent Tamil Eelam, leading to a brutal civil war (1983-2009).
Indo-Lanka Accord (1987) & 13th Amendment
: This attempt at devolution through Provincial Councils failed to fully address Tamil aspirations, leading to continued tensions.
How can the new government address Tamil aspirations and rights?
Full Implementation of the 13th Amendment:
The government should prioritize the effective implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which allows for provincial councils and limited autonomy for Tamil-majority regions. This step is crucial for addressing Tamil political representation and governance.
Engagement in Inclusive Dialogue:
Establishing a direct and inclusive dialogue with Tamil political leaders and communities is essential. This dialogue should focus on addressing historical grievances, ensuring that Tamil voices are heard in national policy-making, and fostering reconciliation.
Address Land Rights and Resettlement Issues:
The government must take action to return lands occupied by the military to their rightful Tamil owners and halt any ongoing land grabs that threaten Tamil communities. Ensuring land rights is vital for restoring trust and dignity among Tamils.
Commitment to Human Rights Accountability:
The new administration should commit to addressing past human rights violations during the civil war, including accountability for wartime atrocities. This includes repealing repressive laws like the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) that disproportionately affect Tamils.
Cultural Recognition and Language Rights:
Promoting Tamil culture and ensuring that Tamil is recognized as an official language alongside Sinhala would help foster a sense of inclusion and respect for Tamil identity within the broader national framework, enhancing community cohesion.
What role does international support play in resolving Sri Lanka’s ethnic issues?
Mediation and Pressure:
Countries like India have historically acted as mediators in Sri Lankan affairs. Their support can encourage the government to adhere to commitments regarding Tamil rights and autonomy.
Development Assistance:
International aid can facilitate economic development in Tamil areas, addressing disparities that fuel ethnic tensions. India’s financial assistance for infrastructure projects is an example of how external support can aid reconciliation efforts.
Monitoring Human Rights:
International organizations can monitor human rights conditions in Sri Lanka, advocating for accountability and justice for past atrocities against Tamils, which is essential for building trust and moving towards lasting peace.
Way forward:
Strengthen Political and Constitutional Reforms
: Ensure full implementation of the 13th Amendment, conduct Provincial Council elections, and explore further constitutional reforms to enhance Tamil political representation and autonomy.
Promote Inclusive Economic Development and Reconciliation
: Invest in infrastructure, employment, and education in Tamil-majority areas while advancing truth, justice, and reconciliation initiatives to address past grievances and build long-term social cohesion.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Crowd Management;
Why in the News?
This week in India, a tragic crowd crush at the Maha Kumbh claimed the lives of 30 people.
What scientific evidence supports the prevention of crowd disasters?
Crowd Density Studies:
Research indicates that crowd crushes become dangerous at densities of five persons per square meter, with serious risks emerging at seven persons per square meter or more. This evidence underscores the need for effective crowd management to prevent dangerous overcrowding.
Predictability of Crowd Behavior:
Scientific studies have shown that crowd dynamics can be predicted and managed. By understanding how crowds behave in different environments, planners can implement strategies to avoid conditions that lead to crushes.
Historical Data on Past Incidents:
Analysis of previous crowd disasters reveals common factors leading to fatalities, such as inadequate space and poor crowd control measures. Lessons learned from these incidents can inform better practices for future events.
How can effective crowd management practices be implemented at large events?
Strategic Planning:
Event organizers should create a comprehensive plan that includes crowd flow evaluation, risk assessment, and clearly marked exits and entrances. This planning should involve local officials to ensure safety measures are adequate.
Staggered Entry and Exit Times:
To reduce peak crowd density, organizers can stagger arrival and departure times for attendees, allowing for a more manageable flow of people into and out of the venue.
Use of Barriers:
Implementing physical barriers can help segment crowds into smaller groups, reducing the likelihood of dangerous surges. Barriers should be designed to allow for emergency exits if needed.
Crowd Monitoring Systems:
Utilizing technology for real-time monitoring of crowd density and behaviour can help event staff respond quickly to potential dangers. Mass notification systems can alert staff about growing concerns, enabling timely interventions.
Staff Training and Communication:
Ensuring that all staff and security personnel are trained in crowd management techniques is essential. Clear communication protocols should be established to relay information quickly during an event.
What role do policies and regulations play in enhancing crowd safety?
Mandatory Safety Regulations:
Governments should introduce regulations requiring event organizers to adhere to safety standards that limit crowd density and ensure adequate emergency planning. Such policies can hold organizers accountable for crowd safety.
Economic Incentives for Compliance:
While event organizers often prioritize profit over safety, regulations can create incentives for them to implement safer practices, such as limiting ticket sales based on venue capacity.
Post-Incident Reviews and Accountability:
Establishing a framework for reviewing crowd disasters can lead to improved regulations and practices in the future. Accountability measures can encourage compliance with safety standards among event planners and local authorities.
Public Awareness Campaigns:
Governments can promote awareness about crowd safety among the public, educating attendees on how to behave in crowded situations and the importance of following safety protocols during events.
What are the steps taken by the government?
National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Guidelines:
The NDMA has formulated guidelines to ensure safe crowd management during mass gatherings. These guidelines include regulating traffic, using barricades, and ensuring adequate police presence to manage crowds effectively.
Capacity Evaluation:
Before hosting large events, there is a requirement for proper evaluation of the venue’s capacity. This ensures that the infrastructure can handle the expected crowd size without leading to dangerous overcrowding.
Use of Technology:
The government encourages the deployment of advanced technologies such as CCTV surveillance, drones for aerial monitoring, and public address systems to enhance crowd management and safety.
Traffic Management:
Effective traffic management strategies are implemented, including displaying route maps, managing unauthorized parking, and controlling pedestrian flow around event venues to prevent bottlenecks.
Way forward:
Strengthen Regulatory Framework
– Governments should enforce stricter crowd safety regulations, mandating capacity limits, emergency preparedness, and real-time crowd monitoring for all large events.
Enhance Technological Integration
– Deploy AI-based crowd analytics, drone surveillance, and real-time alert systems to monitor crowd density and movement. Training event staff in using these technologies will improve response times and prevent disasters.

It thus supports the idea that asteroids
delivered key building blocks for life
to early Earth.
Calcite, halite, sylvite, and trona
were found, indicating
prolonged exposure to liquid water
Similar briny conditions have been observed on
Ceres and Enceladus
, suggesting the
solar system had widespread environments suitable for organic chemistry
Life on Earth exclusively uses
left-handed amino acids
, but Bennu samples show an
equal mix
, raising questions about
why life evolved with this preference
About Asteroid Bennu
is a
carbon-rich
asteroid that orbits between
Earth and Mars
It is believed to be a
primitive remnant of the early solar system
, holding clues to the origins of life.
The asteroid is
porous
, with up to
60% empty space
, affecting its
collision potential with Earth
in the distant future.
It periodically
ejects material
, classifying it as an
active asteroid
was NASA’s
first asteroid sample-return mission
, launched in
2016
to study and collect material from
Bennu’s surface
The spacecraft
arrived at Bennu in 2018
, mapped its surface for two years, and
collected samples in 2020
It successfully
returned the material to Earth in 2023
The mission aimed to analyze
Bennu’s composition
, understand its
water history
, and study the
that may have played a role in the origin of life.
Significance of the Study:
It strengthens the theory that
asteroids contributed to life’s origins
by delivering
organic molecules and water
It confirms that
essential ingredients for life were widespread in the early solar system
, increasing the possibility of
life beyond Earth
It helps refine
planetary defense strategies
, as Bennu has a
small chance of impacting Earth in the future

What is the difference between asteroids and comets?
Asteroids are small rocky planetoids, while comets are formed of frozen gases held together by rocky and metallic material.
Asteroids are found mostly between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, while comets are found mostly between Venus and Mercury.
Comets show a perceptible glowing tail, while asteroids do not.

Why in the News?
India has dispatched a humanitarian aid consignment to the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
What is the Kurdistan Region?
The
refers to areas inhabited by
ethnic Kurds
, primarily in
Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey
Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)
administers
Iraqi Kurdistan
autonomous region in northern Iraq
The Kurds, a distinct
ethnic and linguistic group
, have long sought
independence and greater autonomy
Geographical Significance:
Spans across
Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria
, covering the
Zagros Mountains and fertile plains
Rich in oil and natural gas
, particularly in
, making it geopolitically significant.
Controls key
border regions
and trade routes, influencing regional stability.
Political Implications:
Kurdish struggle for autonomy
has led to
tensions with central governments
Iraq and Turkey
Kurdish forces (Peshmerga)
have played a key role in
fighting ISIS
and maintaining security in northern Iraq.
KRG has diplomatic ties
with Western countries but lacks full sovereignty.
Ongoing Dispute:
Kurdish independence movement
faces opposition from
Iraq, Turkey, Iran, and Syria
, fearing territorial fragmentation.
Iraq rejected the 2017 Kurdistan independence referendum
, leading to military and economic retaliation.
Turkey continues military operations against Kurdish groups
, considering them a security threat.
Turkey-ISIS-Kurd relationship
remains controversial, with allegations that
Turkey indirectly enabled ISIS against the Kurds
