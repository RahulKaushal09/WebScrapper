Health Regulations Need a Base to Top Approach
Context
In the last week of May,
a devastating fire in a private neonatal care nursing home in New Delhi shocked the nation.
The
aftermath saw intense media coverage and political blame games
, while the grief-stricken parents of the affected infants faced the tragic loss.
This incident underscores the critical issue of systemic failures in health-care regulations and
therefore it is crucial to explore the complexities of health-care regulations in India, the challenges faced by both the private and public sectors
, and the necessary reforms to ensure effective and equitable health services.
An Overview of Health-Care Regulation in India: A Systemic Issue
India's health-care regulation
system is characterised
by an excess rather than a lack of regulation.
Some states require over 50 approvals
under various regulations for health-care facilities.
Despite this,
there is a widespread belief that the private health sector is under-regulated.
This paradox arises from the unrealistic standards
set by these regulations.
Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010, though well-intentioned, has seen limited adoption
due to its impractical provisions.
Similarly,
the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), established to ensure quality in government health-care facilities, are met by only 15-18%
of primary health-care centres even after 17 years.
The Mixed Health-Care System in India: Contributions and Dynamics
Public Health-Care Sector
The public health-care sector in India comprises
government-run facilities at various levels, including primary health centres (PHCs), community health centres (CHCs), district hospitals
, and specialised tertiary care hospitals.
These
facilities are intended to provide free or highly subsidised health services
to the population.
public sector is primarily responsible for public health initiatives
, maternal and child health services, and managing communicable diseases.
Government health facilities are distributed across rural and urban areas
, aiming to make health services accessible to the most remote and underserved populations.
Private Health-Care Sector
private health-care sector in India includes a diverse range of providers
, from single-doctor clinics and small nursing homes to large, multi-specialty corporate hospitals.
Private facilities cater to a significant portion of the health-care needs in India
, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.
Many private hospitals offer high-quality services
, advanced medical technologies, and efficient care delivery and this attracts patients seeking timely and specialised treatments.
Private clinics and nursing homes are often more accessible to patients
, offering services with shorter wait times and personalised care.
The Interaction between Private and Public Health-Care
Patient Choices
Patients often prefer private facilities over public ones
, despite the higher costs.
preference is driven by perceptions of better quality
, shorter wait times, and personalised care in the private sector.
Complementary Roles
In some regions,
public and private sectors complement each other.
For instance, public health campaigns and preventive care initiatives are often supported by private providers
who handle more complex and specialized treatments.
Health Indicators
States with robust private health sectors
, such as Maharashtra and Kerala,
often report better health indicators.
This is not solely due to exceptional public health services
but because the private sector fills critical gaps in service delivery.
Regulatory Challenges:
Effective regulation of the mixed system is challenging.
Private facilities may face more rigorous enforcement of regulations
, leading to perceptions of unfair treatment compared to government facilities.
Challenges Faced by Private Health-Care Providers
Regulatory Burdens
Some states impose over 50 different approvals under various regulations
, which must be followed by every health-care facility.
creates a cumbersome process
that is difficult to manage.
Applications for necessary permits
and renewals
often experience significant delays.
Facilities that apply well in advance can wait months for approval, disrupting operations and planning.
Regulatory enforcement is often inconsistent
, with private facilities feeling targeted more than their public counterparts.
discrepancy leads to perceptions of unfair treatment
and regulatory bias.
Financial Constraints
Maintaining and upgrading health-care facilities
to meet regulatory standards and patient expectations
requires significant financial investment.
includes costs for advanced medical equipment
, infrastructure, staff salaries, and compliance with safety norms.
Smaller private facilities often struggle to secure funding
and loans needed for expansion or upgrading their services.
Banks and financial institutions may be hesitant to lend to small health-care providers
due to perceived risks.
Operational Challenges
Recruiting and retaining qualified health-care professionals
persistent challenge.
Many providers face shortages of skilled doctors, nurses, and support staff, which affects the quality of care.
The extensive paperwork and administrative tasks required for compliance and operational management can divert time
and resources away from patient care.
Smaller facilities may lack dedicated administrative staff to handle these tasks efficiently.
Case Study of Challenges Faced by Private Health-Care Providers: The Delhi Fire Tragedy
The fire tragedy in a private neonatal care
underscores the challenges faced by private health-care providers.
incident highlighted issues related to safety compliance
, regulatory oversight, and the subsequent response by authorities.
private facility faced severe regulatory action
, including a temporary suspension of its license,
whereas similar incidents in public hospitals often result in less stringent consequences
, such as the formation of inquiry committees.
discrepancy illustrates the regulatory pressures and operational difficulties
unique to private providers.
Necessary Reforms for Effective Health-Care Regulation
Streamlining Regulations
Simplifying and harmonising health-care regulations
can reduce the administrative burden on private providers.
A single-window clearance system
for approvals and renewals
can expedite processes and minimise delays.
Financial Support:
Providing financial assistance, such as
subsidies, low-interest loans, and grants, can help smaller private facilities
meet regulatory standards and improve infrastructure.
Capacity Building
Investing in training and capacity building for health-care professionals can address staffing shortages and improve the quality of care.
Support for technology adoption and digital health initiatives can also enhance operational efficiency.
Equitable Enforcement
Ensuring fair and consistent regulatory enforcement across both public and private sectors can build trust and encourage compliance.
Creating a transparent and accountable regulatory framework is essential
for equitable treatment.
Focus on Primary Care Providers:
Supporting single-doctor clinics and small nursing homes
, which are vital for providing affordable and accessible primary care,
can help bridge the urban-rural divide
and ensure comprehensive health service delivery.
These are what deliver primary care and contribute to
keeping the cost of health care low.
Conclusion
The New Delhi fire tragedy is a stark reminder of the need for reform in India's health-care
regulation system.
Simplified, realistic, and inclusive regulations are essential
for promoting accessible, affordable, and quality health services.
By supporting primary care providers
and ensuring fair enforcement,
India can move towards achieving the goals of the National Health Policy, 2017.

Editorial Analysis
**********29th edition of the Conference of Parties (COP)
Why in news?
Azerbaijan is the host of this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 29). It wants to prevent geopolitical tensions from affecting the talks.
Hence, the upcoming COP 29 (in November 2024) will focus on promoting "peace" and a "truce" to allow countries to concentrate on climate solutions amid ongoing conflicts.
What’s in today’s article?
Conference of the Parties (COP)
The Upcoming COP 29 and Truce Proposal
COP is the annual United Nations (UN) climate meeting
In 1992, at the Rio Earth Summit
, 154 countries signed a multilateral treaty called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
It aimed to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system.
The treaty came into force two years later, and since then, countries which are part of the UNFCCC, meet every year at different venues.
Today, there are 198 ‘parties’ or signatories of the Convention.
COP was a result of a strong belief in the power of international agreements to tackle environmental problems
Policymakers of that era believed in a unified commitment to deal with climate change.
Their belief was strengthened by the success of:
the 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer, and
a 1991 bilateral agreement between the US and Canada that helped combat acid rain by limiting the emission of sulphur dioxide (SO2).
This led to the inception of UNFCCC.
The first ever COP took place in Berlin, Germany, in 1995
The first edition of COP entailed a discussion on how to implement the UNFCCC.
At the meeting, an
agreement was reached to meet annually to discuss action on climate change and emissions reductions
In the following two years, another deal was made that placed international
obligations on the set of rich and industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by assigned amounts
The agreement would become the
Kyoto Protocol
as it was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, during the
COP-3
Paris Agreement (COP 21)
The Paris Agreement, also known as COP21, is a legally binding international treaty on climate change.
It was adopted by 196 parties at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, France in December 2015.
The agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016.
The Paris Agreement's main objectives are:
Limit global warming: Keep global warming below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions: Significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2100
Support countries: Strengthen countries' ability to deal with the impacts of climate change
Provide financing: Provide financing to developing countries to mitigate climate change
Azerbaijan to be the host of COP 29
Azerbaijan, as the host, will lead the 29th edition of the conference.
It will build upon the agenda set in COP 28 in Dubai. Key points include transitioning away from fossil fuels to achieve net zero by 2050.
Azerbaijan will aim to guide countries toward consensus on addressing the climate crisis, emphasizing the urgency of keeping global temperatures from rising more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
A major issue to be addressed is the
unfulfilled
2009 commitment
by developed countries to provide $100 billion annually to developing countries for climate action
In 2024, the conference is expected to set a new annual target above $100 billion and determine whether the funds will be grants or loans.
Truce Proposal – need for climate unity despite geopolitical divisions
Azerbaijan is aiming to shield the annual talks from geopolitical tensions by proposing a
two-week COP truce
This initiative, inspired by the Olympic truce, is intended to unite countries in a collaborative effort to address the pressing issue of climate change.
As per the host of COP 29, the climate crisis is a universal issue that requires an inclusive approach.
The current global political divide is similar to the Cold War era, making it hard to agree on climate action.
Challenges in Achieving Net Zero
Many developing countries lack the institutional capacity and financial awareness needed to prepare effective NDCs.
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are climate action plans that countries create to help meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.
NDCs are self-defined pledges that outline how countries will reduce emissions, adapt to climate change, and secure funding to support these efforts.
They are short- to medium-term plans that must be updated every five years with more ambitious goals based on each country's capabilities.
Azerbaijan is working towards its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, but more support and awareness are needed to achieve this target.
NDCs are crucial for countries to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the 1.5°C target.
Several countries submitted their latest NDCs by 2023, with the next submissions expected by 2028.

**********When Jailed Leaders Win the Election
Why in news?
Jailed leaders Amritpal Singh and Engineer Rashid, who ran as independent candidates in the Lok Sabha elections, have won the election.
Both the leaders are currently in prison on serious charges that are being probed by the National Investigation Agency.
As per the Indian laws, despite facing criminal charges, they were eligible to contest election unless convicted. However, like other accused persons in Indian prisons, they were barred from voting in the recently held elections.
What’s in today’s article?
What are the charges on both the leaders?
What happens when jailed leaders win polls?
Amritpal Singh, the leader of Waris Punjab De, was arrested in 2023 under the National Security Act (NSA) after going into hiding during a crackdown on his Sikh separatist group.
The NSA is a law that allows the government to detain people for up to 12 months without formal charges.
He has been in prison in Dibrugarh, Assam, since then.
Engineer Rashid, a two-time MLA and founder of the Jammu and Kashmir Awami Ittehad Party, won the Baramullah seat against former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.
He has been in jail for the past five years.
Rashid was arrested in 2019 under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) on charges of money laundering related to terror funding.
Even though they are in prison, winning the Lok Sabha elections means Amritpal and Rashid are now parliamentarians.
Now, they have a constitutional mandate as parliamentarians, which starts with them taking oath.
Taking Oath as Parliamentarians
Taking oath is the first step for Amritpal and Rashid to fulfill their roles as parliamentarians.
Although not explicitly stated in the Constitution
, jailed lawmakers have been granted
temporary parole
in the past to take their oaths.
Past Instances of Parole for Oath Taking
Sanjay Singh (March 2021)
The Aam Aadmi Party leader, imprisoned in Tihar on money laundering charges, was granted permission by a court to take his oath as a Rajya Sabha MP for a second term.
The court directed the jail superintendent to ensure his secure transport to Parliament and back.
Akhil Gogoi (2021)
After winning from Sibsagar, Assam, an NIA court allowed Akhil Gogoi to temporarily leave prison to take his oath as a member of the Assam Legislative Assembly.
George Fernandes (1977)
The trade unionist was elected from the Muzaffarpur seat while in jail during the Emergency.
He was released from prison before the oath ceremony.
Duties as a lawmaker
Being allowed to take the oath is not the same as being released on bail
. It is more like a special parole for a day.
After taking the oath, the jailed lawmaker must write to the Speaker to explain that they cannot attend the proceedings.
This is crucial because
Article 101(4) of the Constitution
states that if an MP is absent from all meetings for over 60 days without permission, their seat will be declared vacant
To attend a Parliament session or cast a vote, the lawmaker must get court permission.
Disqualification from the Parliament
Section 8 of the Representation of People Act, 1951 (RP Act) is titled
“Disqualification on conviction for certain offences
”.
It mandates that individuals convicted of
specified offences are disqualified from contesting elections to Parliament or state legislatures from the date of conviction
Hence, as per the current law, only a conviction and a sentence of two or more years will lead to disqualification from Parliament.
Additionally, they face a six-year disqualification period from contesting elections, starting from the date of their release.

**********IPO-Related Norms in India
Why in the News?
In a bid to expedite the processing of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) will now seek additional information from lead managers (LMs) when they file draft documents.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About IPO
Advantages of an IPO
News Summary
What is an Initial Public Offering (IPO)?
An IPO (Initial Public Offering) in India is the
process through which a privately held company offers its shares to the public for the first time
and becomes a publicly traded company.
In India,
Reliance was the first Indian company to go public in 1977
, before the regulator – the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) – was constituted.
During the 1990s, India opened its doors to foreign capital and embarked on a journey of economic liberalisation. This era featured a wave of significant landmark IPOs.
Purpose
:
Companies go public to raise capital for expansion, debt repayment, or other financial goals.
It also allows early investors and company founders to realize gains on their investments.
Regulatory Framework
The IPO process in India is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
SEBI sets the rules and guidelines to ensure transparency, fairness, and investor protection in the IPO process.
Preparation
The company must prepare detailed financial statements and draft a prospectus, which provides potential investors with comprehensive information about the company's business, financials, risks, and the terms of the offering.
Approval
The draft prospectus is submitted to SEBI for approval.
SEBI reviews the document to ensure all regulatory requirements are met and that the information provided is accurate and complete.
Methods for Pricing the IPO
Book Building
: The price is determined based on investor demand within a price band set by the company and its underwriters.
Fixed Price
: The price is set in advance and mentioned in the prospectus.
Underwriters
Investment banks and financial institutions act as underwriters, helping the company with the IPO process, setting the price band, marketing the offering, and buying any unsold shares.
Bidding
Once the IPO is open for subscription, investors can bid for shares within the price band (in a book-building IPO) or at the fixed price.
Allotment
After the subscription period ends, shares are allotted to investors based on the demand and the company’s allocation policy.
If the IPO is oversubscribed, shares may be allotted on a proportionate basis or through a lottery system for retail investors.
Listing
The company's shares are listed on stock exchanges such as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
Once listed, the shares can be bought and sold in the open market.
Post-IPO Compliance
After the IPO, the company must comply with ongoing disclosure and reporting requirements set by SEBI and the stock exchanges to maintain transparency and protect investor interests.
Advantages for a Company to Pursue IPO:
Enables the company to raise funds for growth and expansion
This is the primary reason for companies to list their securities on stock exchanges.
By going public, the company can issue fresh share capital, which eventually helps in raising funds for growth and enables further expansion by taking up capital expenditures that would increase operational capacity and eventually profitability of the company.
The funds can also be used to fulfil the debt liabilities of the company.
Provides an exit route for existing shareholders
Going public can help the existing shareholders (including seed investors) liquidate their stake in the company.
An IPO enables them to offer their shares in the company to the public by way of offer for sale, pursuant to which they can liquidate their stake partially or completely.
Amplifies reputation and credibility of the company
Pursuant to becoming listed, the company falls under the obligation to adhere to certain compliances and disclosures as prescribed by SEBI, thus ensuring implementation of good corporate governance practices and protection of the stakeholders from fraud and mismanagement.
It helps boost the confidence of shareholders in the management and operations of the company.
Enhances diversification
When a company lists its securities, investors can buy and sell shares on an exchange.
As a result, there is more diversity among investors, as no single investor owns a majority of the company’s outstanding stock (because of certain disclosures and holding restrictions imposed by SEBI).
As a result, purchasing stock in a publicly traded company can help diversify investment portfolios.
IPO-Related Norms in India:
SEBI’s additional disclosure requirements include details about pre-IPO placements, shareholders, previous agreements, and ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) allottees.
The average time SEBI takes to clear the
Draft Red Herring Prospectus
(DRHP) — a document companies must file before accessing public funds — has dropped to less than 90 days in 2024.
This is a significant decrease compared to the average of 126 days in 2022 and 108 days in 2023.
The past three years (from 2021 to 2023) have witnessed a total of 160 IPOs in India,
raising close to 230,000 crore INR from the market

**********Decoding Delhi’s Water Crisis: Causes, Impact and Solution
Why in News?
The Supreme Court directed the Himachal Pradesh government to release 137 cusecs of water it has in surplus and asked Haryana to do the needful to resolve the drinking water crisis in Delhi.
This came after the AAP government in Delhi had approached the SC (alleging the BJP-government in Haryana for stopping Yamuna’s water supply), amidst a surge in water demand during prolonged heatwave.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Where is the Water in Delhi Coming From, and Water Stress in Delhi?
Reasons for Water Scarcity in Delhi
Challenges Posed by Water Scarcity
What are the Solutions to Address Water Scarcity?
Delhi gets most of its water from the
Yamuna, Ravi-Beas and Ganga rivers
From the
, via the Upper Ganga Canal in UP, Delhi receives 470 cusecs/ roughly 254 million gallons per day (MGD) of water.
Two channels (carrier lined channel (CLC) Munak and the Delhi sub-branch (DSB) canals) entering Delhi from Haryana supply Delhi (1094 cusecs) with water from the
Yamuna and Ravi-Beas
The Delhi Jal Board (DJB)
also takes water directly from the
and supplements its river-water supply with
ground water
drawn from Delhi’s
tubewells and wells
According to the Composite Water Management Index released by NITI Aayog in 2019, five of the world’s 20 largest cities under water stress are in India, with
Delhi being second on the list.
Reasons for Water Scarcity in Delhi:
Over-extraction of groundwater:
According to the Economic Survey 2023-24, Delhi has a daily water demand of 1,290 MGD, of which the DJB currently produces 1,000 MGD. The gap is met by Delhi’s groundwater reserves.
Pollution of water sources:
High ammonia levels
(more than 2.5 parts per million) in the Yamuna have long contributed to poor water supply in parts of Delhi.
Numerous drains and rivulets
discharge toxic waste
from small and medium industries into the Yamuna river, eventually affecting Delhi’s clean water supply.
Impact of climate change:
According to the draft of the Delhi State Action Plan on Climate Change, the city is projected to incur economic losses of Rs 2.75 trillion by 2050 as a result of climate change impacts.
Rising temperatures and erratic precipitation
patterns pose significant challenges to the city’s water supply.
Inefficient water management:
The Opposition alleges that the annual water shortage during summers is solely because of the inefficient water management of the state government.
The Central Water Commission’s inefficient role in managing the three barrages in Wazirabad, ITO, and Okhla indicates
poor coordination and transparency among Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh governments.
Inter-state water disputes:
Water disputes between Haryana and Delhi have centred around the allocation of water from the Yamuna river. Haryana alleges that Delhi is drawing more water than allocated under various agreements.
Water treatment plant (WTP) capacity:
The WTP in North Delhi’s Wazirabad was functioning below its capacity because the Yamuna did not have enough water (due to deficit rainfalls) for the DJB to draw from the Wazirabad reservoir.
Challenges Posed by Water Scarcity:
Health issues:
With the reduced availability of clean water, marginalised communities living in unauthorised colonies often have to rely on unsafe water sources, leading to
waterborne diseases
Insufficient water supply also hampers the maintenance and cleanliness of public toilets. When water is scarce, sewage systems can fail, which increases the risk of diseases such as
cholera
Social and economic impact:
Increased illness due to poor hygiene and sanitation leads to
higher healthcare costs
for individuals and the government.
Frequent illnesses
impact productivity
as people miss work or school, affecting their economic well-being and academic opportunities.
The dependence on water tankers
for domestic needs can be unreliable and costly, leading to further economic strain for the marginalised communities.
Water conservation and management:
Recently, the Delhi government ordered a
crackdown on water misuse
, authorising inspection teams to fine offenders using pipes to wash cars, allowing water tanks to overflow, and using domestic water supply for construction.
The teams are also authorised to
disconnect illegal water connections at construction sites
or commercial establishments.
To stop waste discharge from entering Yamuna, the
National Green Tribunal (NGT)
and the State Pollution Control Boards need to take the initiatives.
Water rationing strategies
must be announced during summer months.
Technological interventions:
The DJB, in collaboration with Hitachi India, is using
field sensors and smart metres
at the Pitampura water distribution network.
Such technological intervention could
enable remote and real-time monitoring
and control of plant operations.
Infrastructure development:
The DJB can be
more commercially-oriented
and customers (households, businesses and industries) should be prepared to pay for the ‘real cost’ of supply. The DJB has recently increased infra charges for new water connections.
Policy and governance reforms:
State and city governments should consider water resource availability in the region while creating city plans and providing permits for new establishments.
They must restrict any development activities that are not sustainable in terms of water management.
Community participation in rainwater harvesting:
Delhi’s rainwater harvesting potential amounts to a staggering 907 billion litres annually.
To effectively implement rooftop rainwater harvesting, various awareness campaigns can be organised at the community level.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges between India and Canada
Why in the news?
A parliamentary committee report in Canada has claimed India as the second-biggest foreign threat to the country’s democracy.
About the Khalistan Movement
Origins and Objectives:
The Khalistan Movement is a separatist movement seeking to create an independent Sikh state called Khalistan in the Punjab region of India.
Activities in Canada:
Canada has a significant Sikh population, and some members support the Khalistan Movement. This has led to tensions between Canadian Sikhs and the Indian government.
Notable Incident:
The murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan ideologue, in Surrey, British Columbia, on June 18, 2023, intensified these tensions.
Historical Background
Canada and India established
diplomatic relations in 1947
. The relationship was enhanced by personal ties between Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Canadian Prime Ministers Louis St. Laurent and Lester B. Pearson
in the 1940s and 1960s.
Canada provided significant aid to India under the “
Colombo Plan”
, including food aid, project financing, and technical assistance. India has been one of the largest recipients of Canadian bilateral aid, amounting to
over $3.8 billion CAD
Recent Developments
India and Canada have seen significant growth in bilateral trade, reaching
$8.16 billion in 2023.
Canada is home to over
1.2 million people of Indian origin
, who are well-integrated into the mainstream and active in politics.
The two countries have a strategic partnership underpinned by
shared values of democracy and pluralism
, with regular high-level interactions and long-standing people-to-people ties.
India and Canada have signed several agreements, including the
Air Services Agreement, Extradition Treaty, Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty,
Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.
Interference Allegations:
Canada claims that India has expanded its interference efforts beyond countering pro-Khalistani activities to include targeting Canadian politicians, ethnic media, and Indo-Canadian communities.
Mutual Suspicion:
The Canadian Security Intelligence Service has also accused India of being involved in the election process in Canada, a claim denied by India.
Ethnic and Political Dynamics:
The presence of a significant pro-Khalistan population in Canada complicates bilateral relations, with domestic politics in both countries influencing diplomatic interactions.
India’s Stand
Denial of Allegations:
The Indian government has consistently denied allegations of interference in Canadian affairs and the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.
Counter-Terrorism:
India views the Khalistan Movement as a terrorist threat and seeks to counter its activities both domestically and internationally.
Diplomatic Responses:
In response to accusations from Canada, India has taken measures such as suspending visa services and issuing official statements to refute claims of interference.
Way forward:
Regular Consultations:
Establish a framework for regular high-level meetings between Indian and Canadian officials to address mutual concerns and prevent misunderstandings.
Bilateral Committees:
Form joint committees to handle specific issues such as security concerns, immigration, and trade disputes.
Mains question for practice:
Q
Discuss the origins and objectives of the Khalistan Movement and analyse the current challenges it poses to bilateral relations between India and Canada.

**********Regulator SEBI expands promoter definition for IPO-bound companies    
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
SEBI and its regulatory functions
Mains level:
Issue Over Subjective Definition
Why in the news?
SEBI expands promoter definition for IPO-bound companies, including founders holding 10% or more, and their immediate relatives.
According to current SEBI regulations, a promoter is someone who controls the affairs of the company or can appoint the majority of directors or is named as such in an offer document.
What is an IPO?
An IPO is an initial public offering, in which shares of a private company are made available to the public for the first time.
An IPO allows a company to raise equity capital from public investors.
The Dutch are credited with conducting the first modern IPO by offering shares of the Dutch East India Company to the general public.
What Norms Say
Expanded Definition of Promoter:
The definition of a promoter has been expanded for companies preparing for an IPO. A promoter is someone who controls the company’s affairs, can appoint the majority of directors, or is named as such in an offer document.
Previous Criteria:
Founders holding 25% were previously deemed promoters due to their negative control and power to block special resolutions.
New Criteria:
Founders holding 10% or more must classify themselves as promoters if they are key managerial personnel (KMP) or directors in the company. Immediate relatives on the company board or KMP will also be classified as promoters, even if they hold just 1%.
About Declassification and 31A of LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations
Declassification Difficulty:
The current regulations do not provide an easy path for declassifying a promoter as a public shareholder.
Rule 31A of LODR Regulations:
To be declassified, a person must not hold more than 10% in the listed company along with their relatives.
Restrictive Nature:
This restrictive rule makes declassification almost impossible for immediate relatives who are classified as promoters by virtue of their relationship, especially problematic for married daughters with no active role in the company.
Subjective Nature of Promoter Definition:
The definition of a promoter has been historically subjective, leading to varying interpretations and legal disputes.
Court Rulings:
There have been several court rulings addressing the subjective nature of who qualifies as a promoter, highlighting inconsistencies and complexities.
Complex Criteria:
Accounting standards and regulatory criteria for determining control and influence in a company are often complicated and can be interpreted in multiple ways.
Need for Objectivity:
Experts argue for a more objective test to ascertain control and promoter status, which would provide clearer guidelines and reduce disputes.
Example:
Vinod Kothari, Director at Vinod Kothari Consultants, points out that moving towards an objective test is a positive step, given the current complexities in determining control.
Way forward:
Standardised Guidelines:
Develop clear and standardised guidelines for identifying promoters, reducing subjectivity and ensuring consistency.
Detailed Disclosures:
Mandate detailed disclosures from companies about their promoters, including shareholding patterns, roles, and influence in decision-making.
Mains PYQ:
In the light of Satyam Scandal (2009), discuss the changes brought in corporate governance to ensure transparency and accountability.

is on a formal visit to China to attend the
formal announcement
of the
second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC-II).
About CPEC-II
CPEC’s next phase shifts focus from infrastructure and energy to sectors like agriculture,
Pakistan Railways’ Main Line-I (ML-1) upgrade
, and realignment of the Karakorum Highway.
CPEC was
initiated in 2015
as part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
Why CPEC-II?
It will provide Pakistan with a strategic advantage in terms of trade and commerce
CPEC-II includes significant investments in the energy sector, which will help overcome Pakistan’s chronic power shortages and ensure a stable supply of electricity
Provides a shortcut for China’s access to the Persian Gulf to secure oil imports, and
Stimulate industrial and economic activity in Pakistan.
The Belt and Road Initiative, formerly known as One Belt One Road, is
a global infrastructure development strategy
adopted by the Chinese government in
2013
It will invest in nearly
70 countries
and international organizations.
Infrastructure projects include ports, railways, highways, power stations, aviation and telecommunications.
“Belt” refers to the overland routes for road and rail transportation
, called “the Silk Road Economic Belt”; whereas “
road” refers to the sea routes or the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
The project has a
target completion date
2049
which coincides with the 100th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China.
India’s Concerns
Sovereignty Concerns:
India expresses reservations as CPEC traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), challenging territorial sovereignty and potentially bolstering Pakistan’s claim over the region.
Geostrategic Implications:
The expansion of Gwadar port under CPEC extends China’s “String of Pearls” around India, prompting concerns over regional power dynamics.
CPEC’s Progress so Far
Mixed Outcomes:
The initial phase of CPEC primarily addressed infrastructure, energy, and port development projects, with progress showing variations.
Project Status:
While several power projects have been completed, significant delays and challenges persist in transport-related projects and Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
Challenges and Roadblocks
Slow pace:
Gwadar, despite being the epicentre of multibillion-dollar projects, lacks basic necessities like reliable access to water and electricity, let alone other facilities.
Baloch freedom movement:
This is another impediment to the stalled project where Chinese officials are targeted and killed.
Consistent security threat:
China is also seeking to deploy its Army in the CPEC projects, to which Pakistan has contested.

**********First Human Case of Avian H5N2 Infection
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
H5N2 , Avian Influenza A
Why in the News?
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the
death of a Mexican resident due to bird flu
, marking the first confirmed case of human infection with the H5N2 variant.
This H5N2 strain is
different from another bird flu variety-
H5N1
which infected people in America recently.
What is Avian Influenza A (H5N2)?
Avian Influenza A (H5N2) is a
subtype of the influenza A virus
that primarily circulates among birds but can infect humans under certain circumstances.
Human infections typically result from
direct contact with infected birds
or contaminated environments, showcasing the zoonotic nature of the virus.
Symptoms of H5N2
Infection of H5N2 may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal.
Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.
Diagnostic and Treatment Protocols
Laboratory Diagnosis:
The identification of avian influenza in humans necessitates laboratory testing to confirm the presence of the virus.
WHO Guidance:
The World Health Organization periodically updates technical protocols, such as RT-PCR methods, to enhance the detection of zoonotic influenza.
Treatment Strategies:
Antiviral medications, notably neuraminidase inhibitors like oseltamivir and zanamivir, demonstrate efficacy in reducing viral replication duration and improving survival prospects for afflicted individuals.
Influenza A Viruses
The alphanumeric codes of H and N are used to subdivide the viruses according to what kinds of
proteins are on the surface
of the virus based on 2 types:
Hemagglutinin (HA)
Neuraminidase (NA)
There are
18 known HA
subtypes and
11 known NA
subtypes.
In birds, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been identified. (Two additional subtypes, H17N10 and H18N11, have been identified in bats.)
Many different combinations of HA and NA proteins are possible.
For example, an “A(H7N2) virus” designates an influenza A virus subtype that has an HA 7 protein and an NA 2 protein.
Similarly, an “A(H5N1)” virus has an HA 5 protein and an NA 1 protein.
