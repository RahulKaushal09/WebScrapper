MAHARASHTRA SPECIAL PUBLIC SECURITY BILL
Syllabus
Prelims – POLITY
Context:
On July 11, the BJP-led MahaYuti government introduced the Maharashtra Special Public Security (MSPS) Act, 2024, targeting the issue of Naxalism in urban areas.
Background:-
The provisions of the proposed Bill, which allows the State to declare any organisation as ‘unlawful’ with offences categorised as cognisable and non-bailable, has raised concerns and is being dubbed the ‘urban naxal’ law.
Why was the Bill proposed?
According to Maharashtra government, Naxalism is not limited to rural areas, but is increasing in urban areas through frontal organisations. These active frontal organisations of Naxal groups give constant and effective support in terms of logistics and safe refuge to its armed cadre.
Such frontal organisations propagate maoist ideology of armed rebellion against the constitutional mandate and disrupt public order in the State.
According to government, unlawful activities of such frontal organisations need to be controlled through effective legal means and that existing laws are ineffective to tackle the issue.
How different is it from the UAPA?
The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UAPA) is invoked in cases related to Naxalism and terrorism. This law empowers the state to classify organisations as ‘unlawful associations.’
Both the laws are almost the same. However, in the MSPS Act, an advisory board of three persons who are or have been qualified to be appointed as judges of the High Court shall oversee the confirmation process, while under UAPA, a tribunal led by a High Court judge verifies the State’s declaration.
In addition to the UAPA, the State also enforces the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA) to address perceived extreme situations involving individuals labelled as ‘urban Naxals’.
If the proposed legislation is passed, it would allow the State police and security agencies to arrest individuals without a warrant and often without informing them of the charges. All offences under this Act would be cognisable and non-bailable.
key provisions of MSPS bill
The MSPS Act empowers the State to designate any suspected ‘organisation’ as an ‘unlawful organisation’ and outlines four offences for which a person may be penalised
(i) being a member of an unlawful organisation,
(ii) being a member and raises funds for an unlawful organisation or harbours any member of the unlawful organisation,
(iii) whoever manages or assists in the management of an unlawful organisation, or promotes or assists in promoting a meeting, and
(iv) whoever commits or abets or attempts to commit or plans to commit any unlawful activity.
When could it come into existence?
Since the Bill was tabled at the end of the Assembly’s term, and that too in the Lower House first rather than the Upper House, its progress will largely depend on the next government, as the State is scheduled to go to polls in October or November.
The day after the Bill was tabled, the monsoon session was prorogued, and as a result, the proposed bill lapsed, unless the MahaYuti government issues an ordinance to implement it.

LATE BLIGHT DISEASE
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
The Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI) has issued an advisory for potato farmers across the country, warning of a high risk of late blight disease in the crop due to changes in weather conditions.
Late blight disease, a fungal infection is a significant threat to potato crops, causing substantial yield losses and reducing tuber quality.The disease is favoured by cool, moist weather conditions, making the current weather scenario conducive to its spread.
What is late blight disease?
It is a disease of potato and tomato plants that is caused by the water mold Phytophthora infestans.
The disease occurs in humid regions with temperatures ranging between 4 and 29 °C (40 and 80 °F). Hot dry weather checks its spread.
Potato or tomato plants that are infected may rot within two weeks.
When plants have become infected, lesions (round or irregularly shaped areas that range in colour from dark green to purplish black and resemble frost injury) appear on the leaves, petioles, and stems.
A whitish growth of spore-producing structures may appear at the margin of the lesions on the underleaf surfaces. Secondary fungi and bacteria (particularly Erwinia species) often invade potato tubers and produce rotting that results in great losses during storage, transit, and marketing.
The disease can be managed with a timely application of fungicide, though epidemics can occur rapidly once crops are infected.
In addition to fungicide application, the CPRI advisory stresses the need for proper drainage in fields and preventing weed growth — which can in turn harbour the disease-causing fungus and increase the risk of infection in potato crops.

POLITICAL REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN
Mains – GS 1 & GS 2
In the recently concluded general elections in the U.K., a record 263 women MPs (40%) have been elected to the House of Commons.
India provided the right to vote for all its women right from the first general elections in 1952. While the right to vote was provided to all women since the commencement of the Constitution, the representation of women in the Lok Sabha and State legislative assemblies has been far from satisfactory.
Women representatives in independent India
The percentage of women MPs in the Lok Sabha had been very low between 5% and 10% till 2004. It rose marginally to 12% in 2014 and currently stands at 14% in the 18th Lok Sabha.
The representation in State Legislative Assemblies is even poorer with the national average being around 9%.
As on April 2024, India ranks 143 in the list of countries in the ‘Monthly ranking of women in national parliaments’ published by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a global organisation for national parliaments.
The Trinamool Congress has the highest proportion of women MPs in the current Lok Sabha at 38%.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and principal Opposition Congress party have around 13% each.
Naam Tamilar Katchi, a State party in Tamil Nadu, has been following a voluntary quota of 50% for women candidates in the last three general elections.
How do women MPs fare worldwide?
Women representation in parliament varies across different democracies.
It is a perennial issue to promote higher representation for women who constitute half the population in all countries.
The important methods used across the world to ensure higher representation of women are:
(a) voluntary or legislated compulsory quotas for candidates within political parties and
(b) quota in parliament through reservation of seats.
Quotas within political parties provide more democratic choice to voters and allows flexibility to parties in choosing women candidates.
Opponents of having a reserved quota in parliament for women argue that it would be seen as women not competing on merit. As the seats reserved for women would be rotated after each delimitation, it may also reduce the incentive for MPs to work hard to nurture their constituencies.
What is the 106th amendment?
Parliament through the 106th constitutional amendment provided for one-third reservation of seats for women in the Lok Sabha and State legislative assemblies.
This reservation shall come into effect based on the delimitation exercise after the relevant figures of the first Census conducted after the commencement of this act is published.
Hence, the Census which is overdue since 2021 should be conducted without any further delay to ensure that this reservation is implemented starting with the general elections in 2029.

JERDON’S COURSER
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
Jerdon’s Courser has not been visually spotted in over a decade. This courser is a restricted-range endemic found locally in India in the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh.
Once thought extinct, the species was miraculously rediscovered in 1986 near Reddipalli village in Kadapa, prompting the establishment of the Sri Lankamalleswara wildlife sanctuary.
About
s courser
The Jerdon’s courser (Rhinoptilus bitorquatus) is a nocturnal cursorial (adapted for walking and running) bird endemic to India.
The bird was discovered by the surgeon-naturalist Thomas C. Jerdon in 1848 but not seen again until its rediscovery in 1986.

The Jerdon’s courser is categorised as “Critically Endangered” by BirdLife International and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resource (IUCN) because it is believed to have a small and declining population.
Information on its distribution, population, and habitat requirements is sparse for numerous reasons: its nocturnal habits, nature of its habitat, its shy habits and extreme rarity

ARTICLE 341 OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION
: The recent Supreme Court ruling emphasizes that states do not have the authority to modify the Schedule Caste (SC) list published under Article 341 of the Indian Constitution.
The court quashed a Bihar government notification from 2015 that classified the Tanti-Tantwa community as SC, reverting them back to the category of Extremely Backward Class. The court called the notification “mala fide” and emphasized that only Parliament has the authority to amend the SC list through legislation, not state governments.
About Article 341 :
Article 341 of the Indian Constitution plays a crucial role in the recognition and identification of Scheduled Castes (SC).

**********Intergenerational Equity as Tax Devolution Criterion
Context
The
devolution of Union tax revenue to States remains a perennial topic of debate
among politicians and economists alike and
central to this discussion are the factors influencing the horizontal distribution of States’ shares
in Union tax revenue.
current focus on intragenerational equity, redistributing tax revenue among States, often exacerbates intergenerational inequity
within States.
Therefore,
it is important to examine that intergenerational equity should be integrated into India’s horizontal distribution formula
for tax devolution.
The Principles of Intergenerational Fiscal Equity and Mechanisms to Achieve It
Equal Opportunities and Outcomes
Every generation should have access to similar opportunities
and should not be disadvantaged by the fiscal policies of previous generations.
This
includes access to quality public services
such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
Sustainable Public Finance
Governments should manage their finances
in a way that ensures long-term sustainability.
This means avoiding excessive borrowing
that future taxpayers will have to repay, thus preventing the accumulation of unsustainable public debt.
Mechanisms to Achieve Intergenerational Fiscal Equity
Taxation
Ideally, tax revenues should be sufficient
to cover current public expenditures.
ensures that the current generation pays for the services it receives
, maintaining a balance between revenues and expenditures.
Borrowing
While borrowing can be a useful tool for funding large capital
projects that benefit multiple generations, it should be used judiciously.
Excessive reliance on borrowing for recurrent expenditures shifts the financial burden to future generations
, leading to higher taxes or reduced public services in the future.
Savings and Investments
Governments can establish sovereign wealth funds
or other savings mechanisms to accumulate resources during periods of economic surplus.
These funds can then be used to finance public expenditures
during economic downturns or to invest in long-term projects that benefit future generations.
Case Study to Understand Intergenerational Fiscal Equity: High-Income vs. Low-Income States
High-Income States
Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Haryana are categorised as high-income States.
These States have robust economies and generate substantial own tax revenues,
financing up to 59.3% of their revenue expenditures independently.
Despite this, they receive relatively low Union financial transfers
, compelling them to either curtail expenditures or resort to borrowing, which can lead to higher fiscal deficits.
Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, and Jharkhand fall into the low-income category.
These States struggle to generate sufficient own tax revenues
, covering only 35.9% of their revenue expenditures.
Consequently, they rely heavily on Union financial transfers, which finance about 57.7% of their expenditures,
enabling them to maintain higher levels of public spending relative to their revenues.
Fiscal Indicators and Equity
Population and Area
These indicators reflect the demand for public services.
States with larger populations and areas typically require more resources to provide adequate services
, justifying higher financial transfers.
Per Capita Income
This indicator is used to assess the fiscal capacity of States.
Lower per capita income States receive more transfers
to help them match the service levels of higher-income States.
Tax Effort and Fiscal Discipline
While equity indicators carry significant weight, efficiency indicators
such as tax effort and fiscal discipline
also influence the distribution formula.
States that demonstrate higher tax collection efficiency
and prudent fiscal management are
rewarded with additional transfers, incentivising better fiscal practices
Challenges to Intragenerational Equity
Economic Disparities
significant economic disparities between high-income and low-income States pose a challenge
to achieving intragenerational equity.
Wealthier States may feel burdened by the redistribution of their tax revenues
to less prosperous States, potentially leading to fiscal imbalances.
Public Expectations
Citizens in high-income States expect a level of public services
commensurate with their tax contributions.
When these expectations are not met
due to lower Union financial transfers,
it can lead to public dissatisfaction and political pressure.
Efficiency vs. Equity
Balancing the principles of efficiency and equity is a constant challenge
. While equity aims to level the playing field, efficiency rewards States for good fiscal practices.
The tension between these principles can complicate the design of an optimal distribution formula.
Suggestions to Strengthen Intergenerational Fiscal Equity
Reforming the Distribution Formula
Finance Commission should consider including more fiscal variables
in the tax devolution criteria.
This would incentivise States to improve their tax efforts
and expenditure efficiency, leading to more sustainable fiscal practices.
Enhancing Fiscal Discipline
Greater emphasis on fiscal discipline
and responsible borrowing
practices is essential.
States should be encouraged to adhere to their FRBM limits
and pursue policies that promote long-term fiscal health.
Promoting Balanced Development
Policies aimed at reducing economic disparities
between States can
contribute to more equitable fiscal outcomes.
Investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare in low-income States can enhance their economic prospects and reduce their reliance on Union transfers.
Conclusion
Intergenerational fiscal equity is a fundamental principle that ensures the fair distribution of economic opportunities
and outcomes across generations.
In India’s federal system,
achieving this equity requires a careful balance between taxation, borrowing, and fiscal discipline.
By reforming the distribution formula and promoting responsible fiscal practices, policymakers can ensure that current fiscal decisions do not impose undue burdens on future generations,
fostering a more sustainable and equitable fiscal environment.

Editorial Analysis
**********SEBI’s Proposal on New Asset Class
Why in the News?
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed a new asset class aimed at bridging the gap between mutual funds and portfolio management services (PMS). This aims to cater to investors with investible funds ranging from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About SEBI (Objective, Need, Powers, etc.)
News Summary (About New Asset Class, Objectives, Features, etc.)
About Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI):
The SEBI is a statutory regulatory body established by the Government of India in 1992. It was given statutory powers through the
SEBI Act, 1992
: To regulate the securities market in India and protect the interests of investors in securities.
Why Was SEBI Formed?
SEBI was established to
keep a check on unfair and malpractices and protect the investors from such malpractices
The organization was created to meet the requirements of the following three groups:
Issuers
: SEBI works toward providing a marketplace to the investors where they can efficiently and fairly raise their funds.
Intermediaries
: SEBI works towards providing a professional and competitive market to the intermediaries
Investors
: SEBI protects and supplies accurate information to investors.
Powers of SEBI:
Quasi-judicial powers:
In case of frauds and unethical practices pertaining to the securities market,
SEBI has the power to pass judgments
The said power facilitates to maintain transparency, accountability and fairness in the securities market.
Quasi-executive powers:
SEBI has the power to examine the Book of Accounts and other vital documents to identify or gather evidence against violations.
If it finds one violating the regulations, the
regulatory body has the power to impose rules, pass judgements and take legal actions against violators
Quasi-legislative powers:
To protect the interest of investors, the
authoritative body has been entrusted with the power to formulate suitable rules and regulations
Such rules tend to encompass the listing obligations, insider trading regulations and essential disclosure requirements.
The body formulates such rules and regulation to get rid of malpractices that are prevalent in the securities market.
SEBI’s Proposal on New Asset Class:
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed a new asset class designed to bridge the gap between mutual funds and portfolio management services (PMS).
This new asset class targets investors with a higher risk appetite, offering potentially higher returns.
Need for the New Asset Class:
SEBI identified a gap in the current investment spectrum.
Mutual funds cater to retail investors with varying risk appetites, while PMS and alternative investment funds (AIFs) serve sophisticated, high-net-worth investors.
The new asset class aims to provide an intermediate investment option that combines higher returns with higher risk.
Investment Strategies:
The proposed asset class will include SEBI-approved strategies such as Long-Short Equity Funds and Inverse ETFs/Funds:
: Involve taking both long and short positions in equity and equity-related instruments.
: Aim to generate returns that are negatively correlated with the underlying index.
Global Availability:
Globally, these strategies are already available.
For instance, the US, regulated by the SEC, offers long-short equity funds with hedge fund-like strategies and the liquidity of mutual funds.
Similarly, Australia has various inverse ETF products that allow investors to hedge against market downturns or speculate on market declines.
Investment Threshold:
The minimum investment requirement for this new asset class is Rs 10 lakh per investor.
This threshold is set to discourage retail investors while attracting those with an investible surplus ranging from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.
Investors can use options like Systematic Investment Plans (SIP), Systematic Withdrawal Plans (SWP), and Systematic Transfer Plans (STP) for investing in this new asset class.
The total invested amount should not drop below Rs 10 lakh due to withdrawals or systematic transactions.
Eligibility for Launch:
Mutual funds with an average AUM exceeding Rs 10,000 crore over three years or those managed by experienced CIOs and fund managers are eligible to launch this new asset class.
Proposed Relaxations
Debt Securities
: Limited to 10 percent of NAV, extendable to 12 percent with approval, and up to 20 percent with further approval.
Credit Risk-Based Limits
: Ranges from 10 percent for AAA-rated securities to 6 percent for A and below, each extendable by 2 to 5 percent with approval.
Conclusion:
SEBI's proposed new asset class seeks to provide a regulated, flexible investment option for investors, addressing the gaps between mutual funds and PMS. By attracting sophisticated investors and curbing unauthorized investments, this initiative aims to enhance investment options and manage risks effectively.

**********The State of India’s Informal Economy
Why in News?
According to the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Enterprises (ASUSE), the informal sector in India faces many challenges. Over the last seven years, many small and medium enterprises have shut and about 16.45 lakh jobs have been lost.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Meaning of the Informal Sector of the Economy
About the ASUSE
Highlights of the ASUSE
What is the Significance of the ASUSE Data?
Meaning of the Informal Sector of the Economy:
The term
unorganised/ informal sector
is used interchangeably in the India context.
It consists of
small and medium enterprises and household proprietary and partnership establishments.
The unorganised sector contributes
over 44%
to the country’s gross value added (GVA) and employs
nearly 75% of the workforce
employed in non-agricultural enterprises.
This means the sector accounts for almost half of India’s economic output and more than three-fourths of employment.
The share of the unorganised sector is highest in
agriculture
as the holdings are small and fragmented. This is followed by trade, construction, real estate, professional services, etc.
About the ASUSE:
The ASUSE was released for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (
MoSPI
).
It carried out surveys for
unincorporated
non-agricultural establishments in three sectors: manufacturing, trade, and other services.
Unincorporated enterprises
are enterprises in the unorganised/ informal sector, comprising MSMEs, household units including those with hired workers, and own-account enterprises.
Manufacturing units
other than those covered under the Factories Act 1948 and the organised manufacturing sector covered by the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI), have been surveyed.
Under trade and other services
, proprietary and partnership establishments (excluding LLPs), co-operatives, self-help groups, non-profit institutions, etc., are included.
Highlights of the ASUSE:
The number of workers
employed in the informal sector in 2022-23 has dropped by 16.45 lakh or about 1.5 per cent to 10.96 crore compared to 11.13 crore in 2015-16.
The number of unincorporated enterprises
increased by 16.56 lakh from to 6.50 crore in 2022-23 from 6.33 crore in 2015-16.
The real GVA of unincorporated sector
enterprises grew by 6.9% in 2022-23, which was still lower than the pre-pandemic level.
A crucial employment indicator:
This is because the informal sector is closely watched for its employment generation capacity and absorption of the labour force (especially semi-skilled and unskilled labour).
Highlights the impact of 3 shocks on the informal sector:
The data available for the first time since 2015-16, provides an understanding of the impact of the 3 major exogenous shocks on the growth of unincorporated enterprises and the employment in these enterprises.
These shocks are
demonetisation
in November 2016, rollout of the
Goods and Service Tax
in July 2017, and the
Covid-19 pandemic
in March 2020.
Much of the brunt of these 3 shocks is borne by the informal sector.
Presents state-specific data:
Maharashtra, Bihar, Gujarat, MP and Odisha
recorded an increase in the informal employment between 2015-16 and 2022-23.
UP, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh
registered a decline in the number of informal sector workers during the same period.
These ten states account for nearly three quarters of the informal sector workers employed in India.
Depicts a broad decline in employment quality:
Most new jobs in the sector were created in own-account enterprises rather than hired-worker units.
Matches with the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS):
As per PLFS 2022-23, there was an increase in workers in agriculture, and a decrease in manufacturing.
After three shocks, 16.45 lakh jobs lost in informal sector over 7 years.pdf

**********Govt’s U-Win portal to redraw immunisation map
Why in news?
U-Win, a digital platform set to launch on August 15, aims to transform maternal and child healthcare across India. By digitizing vaccination records, it will replace the current manual system used by ASHA and other healthcare workers, streamlining record-keeping and marking a significant shift in primary healthcare delivery.
What’s in today’s article?
Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)
Status of childhood immunization in India
About
UIP is one of the largest public health programmes targeting close of 2.67 crore newborns and 2.9 crore pregnant women annually.
It is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions and largely responsible for reduction of vaccine preventable under-5 mortality rate.
A child is said to be fully immunized if child receives all due vaccine as per national immunization schedule within 1st year age of child.
Vaccines covered
Under UIP, immunization is providing free of cost against 12 vaccine preventable diseases:
Nationally against 9 diseases - Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Measles, Rubella, severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and Meningitis & Pneumonia caused by Hemophilus Influenza type B.
Sub-nationally against 3 diseases - Rotavirus diarrhoea, Pneumococcal Pneumonia and Japanese Encephalitis.
Two major milestones of UIP
The two major milestones of UIP have been the elimination of polio in 2014 and maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination in 2015.
The U-WIN portal is a replication of the Covid-19 vaccine management system Co-WIN.
It aims to maintain an electronic registry of routine immunizations.
Currently, U-WIN is in pilot mode across all states and Union Territories, except for West Bengal.
It captures every vaccination event for pregnant women and children under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP).
It will ensure timely administration of vaccine doses by digitally recording every vaccination event under the Universal Immunisation Programme among all pregnant women and children aged 0-5 years.
How Does U-Win Work?
Children between 0-5 years will be registered on U-Win. Vaccines given at birth are also recorded.
A list of children, who are scheduled to receive their vaccine doses, is generated through U-Win.
The e-record helps children get vaccinated in different places without carrying a booklet. The portal sends SMS alerts to parents.
The portal also records birth weight and details of physical deformities, if any. This can be used for other government programmes.
Features
The platform generates a uniform QR-based, digitally verifiable e-vaccination certificate, similar to Covid vaccination certificate.
This can be accessed anytime by the citizens through a single click.
It will update vaccination status, and delivery outcome, among others, in real time.
Citizens can self-register for vaccinations via the U-WIN web portal or its Android mobile application, select preferred vaccination centres, and schedule appointments.
Automated SMS alerts inform citizens about registration confirmations, administered doses, and upcoming dose reminders, ensuring timely and age-appropriate vaccinations.
It also facilitates the creation of Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) IDs for comprehensive health record maintenance.
It also supports the frontline workers to digitally record all vaccination events for children and pregnant women for complete, accurate and easy record maintenance.
Benefits
real-time registration of children and the digital vaccination record
on U-Win will help in reducing the number of “zero-dose” children (those who do not receive their first doses of vaccines for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus).
This will be
beneficial for migrant workers
, who can get their children vaccinated at any centre in the country and without the hassle of carrying their child’s vaccination cards.
The U-Win portal is one of the important steps towards
halving the number of zero-dose children by 2030
Besides details of children and pregnant women who are due for vaccinations, the U-Win portal will have a record of health centres and community health workers.
As per the recently released WHO and UNICEF estimates of national immunisation coverage (WUENIC), there was a slight dip in childhood immunisation in 2023 compared to 2022.
There was a two-percentage point dip (from 95% in 2022 to 93% in 2023) in the coverage of the diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) vaccine. The 2023 global average was 89%.
Coverage of the DPT vaccine is used as a proxy for the number of zero-dose children — those who have not received any routine immunisation.
WUENIC shows that there were 1.6 million zero-dose children in India in 2023, up from 1.1 million in 2022, but much less than 2.73 million seen in 2021.
The data also show that the coverage of the
third dose of the DPT vaccine
used as a proxy for under-vaccination
— stood at 91% in 2023, a two-percentage point dip from the previous year, but much higher than the 2023 global average of 84%.
In absolute terms,
04 million children remained under-vaccinated in 2023, slightly lower than the 2.11 million children in 2019

**********EC releases technical instructions to check EVM, VVPAT burnt memory
Why in news?
The Election Commission of India (ECI) released a technical standard operating procedure (SOP) for the verification of burnt memory or microcontrollers in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) devices.
The SOP has been released in accordance with a verdict delivered by the Supreme Court. It aims to ensure the integrity and transparency of the election process by addressing the issue of verifying votes accurately through both electronic and paper means.
What’s in today’s article?
Burnt memory of EVMs and VVPAT units
Background
Key Highlights of the SOP
When will this process of checking start
Criticism of the technical SOP
The burnt memory of EVMs (Electronic Voting Machines) and VVPATs (Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails) refers to the non-volatile memory in these devices where data is stored permanently, even when the device is powered off.
This memory contains critical information such as:
EVMs: Votes cast during the election, the configuration of the machine, and other operational details.
VVPATs: Printed records of the votes cast, which serve as a verifiable paper trail for the electronic votes.
SC Verdict
In its judgment on April 26, 2024, the Supreme Court upheld the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) during the Lok Sabha elections.
It rejected the plea for a return to paper ballots and 100% counting of VVPAT slips.
However, the Court allowed second- and third-placed candidates to
request verification of the burnt memories of EVMs and VVPATs for up to 5% of machines
in an Assembly constituency or a Lok Sabha constituency segment.
This verification is to be conducted by engineers from the EVM manufacturers after the election results are announced.
Candidates or their representatives can identify the EVMs for verification by polling station or serial number and have the option to be present during the verification process.
Requests for verification must be made within seven days of result declaration. The costs for verification are to be notified by the Election Commission of India (ECI) and paid by the requesting candidate, but will be refunded if tampering is found.
Administrative SOP released
Earlier, on June 1, the ECI released the administrative SOP for checking and verification of the burnt memory of EVMs and VVPATs.
An Administrative SOP outlines standard procedures for organizational tasks to ensure consistency and compliance, detailing responsibilities and documentation.
A Technical SOP specifies technical processes and operations, providing step-by-step instructions to maintain quality and safety standards.
Thereafter, eight candidates who had contested the Lok Sabha election, and three candidates for the State Assembly elections in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, had applied for verification of the burnt memory.
Verification Process
The SOP outlines a detailed procedure for verifying the integrity of the microcontrollers in EVMs and VVPATs.
The Election Commission of India (ECI) stated that there are various technical methods to verify the accuracy of firmware burned into a microcontroller within research or secure manufacturing settings.
Verification can be publicly conducted by using numerous random test vectors as inputs and evaluating the intended outcomes.
Mock poll of up to 1,400 votes per machine
A mock poll of up to 1,400 votes per machine would be conducted in the presence of the candidates or their representatives.
Mock polls, of at least 50 votes per machine, are conducted on poll day in the presence of polling agents of candidates, as well as self-diagnosis and mutual authentication of the three parts of the EVM-VVPAT system.
If the result of the machines and VVPAT slips are found to be the same, it would be concluded that the burnt memory or microcontrollers have not been tampered with.
Certain powers assigned to candidates
The candidates can select the polling stations, the EVMs, the BUs, CUs and VVPATs that they want checked.
The checking would be done by trained engineers from the EVM manufacturers, Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL).
When will this process of checking start?
Verification of EVMs and VVPATs will begin only after confirming from the High Courts that no Election Petitions have been filed for the relevant constituencies.
Election Petitions can be filed by any candidate or voter within 45 days of the results, which were announced on June 4, making July 19 the deadline.
A total of 11 applications have been received, covering 118 polling stations or sets of EVMs and VVPATs.
The SOP is silent on what would happen if there is a mismatch between the EVM and VVPAT counts during verification.
Experts said that there is no progress from the established procedure of mock polls that are conducted before polling anyway.
The judgment said the burnt memory or microcontrollers shall be checked and verified. There is no mention of this in the SOP.

Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About NSSO
Mains level:
Key highlight of recent survey by NSSO
Why in the news?
The NSSO’s 2021-22 and 2022-23 survey outcomes reveal effects of significant economic shocks due to demonetisation, GST implementation, and the COVID-19 pandemic on India’s economy.
About NSSO:
The NSSO is India’s premier agency for conducting large-scale nationwide sample surveys on socio-economic aspects that collects data on employment, consumption, health, education, and other areas to provide essential inputs for policy and planning.
The NSSO was merged with the Central Statistical Office in 2019 to form the National Statistical Office.
Key highlight as per the recent survey by NSSO
Impact of Economic Shocks:
The surveys reflect the aftermath of major economic events such as demonetisation (November 2016), the rollout of GST (July 2017), and the COVID-19 pandemic (starting March 2020).
Employment Trends:
There has been a noticeable decline in employment within the informal sector over the past seven years, with around 16.45 lakh jobs lost.
Sectoral Dynamics:
The unincorporated manufacturing sector saw a significant contraction, with the number of enterprises declining by 9.3% from 19.7 million in 2015-16 to 17.82 million in 2022-23.
What are unincorporated enterprises?
Unincorporated enterprises are informal businesses not legally registered as companies.
They include MSMEs, household units, own-account enterprises, and partnerships, operating outside formal regulatory frameworks but contributing significantly to employment and economic activity.
Why are these survey results important and what do they represent?
Timely Insights:
These survey results offer current data crucial for understanding the evolving role of the informal sector in job creation, particularly during economic slowdowns when formal sector employment may decline.
Impact Assessment:
They provide a detailed analysis of how significant economic events like demonetisation, GST implementation, and the COVID-19 lockdowns have affected the informal sector, highlighting vulnerabilities and resilience.
Policy Relevance:
The findings inform policymaking aimed at supporting and regulating the informal sector, ensuring that measures address its unique challenges and contributions to overall economic stability and inclusivity.
What has been the pattern of ‘Informal Employment’ across states?
The data shows a mixed pattern across states, with 16 out of 34 states/UTs recording a decline in informal sector workers in 2022-23 compared to 2015-16.
Around 63 lakh informal enterprises shut down due to GST between 2015-16 and 2022-23, resulting in a loss of about 1.6 crore jobs.
The number of informal enterprises plunged from 50.32 lakh with 85.6 lakh workers in April-June 2021 at the peak of the COVID-19 second wave, to 1.91 crore firms with 3.12 crore employees in January-March 2022.
Way Forward:
The government should provide targeted support and incentives to help informal enterprises adapt to the post-GST and post-pandemic environment.
Policymakers should aim to facilitate a gradual transition of informal enterprises to the formal sector.
Mains PYQ:
How globalization has led to the reduction of employment in the formal sector of the Indian economy? Is increased informalization detrimental to the development of the country?

**********On political representation of women  
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About 106th Amendment Act
Mains level:
Quota should be provided in political parties for women
Why in the News?
In the recently concluded general elections in the U.K., a record 263 women MPs, making up 40% of the total, have been elected to the House of Commons.
Political representation of Women in the world:
Have women been fairly represented in Parliament in independent India?
Women were granted the right to vote from the First General Elections in 1952, yet their representation in the Lok Sabha has been low.
Statistics about women’s representation:
The women’s representation in Lok sabha in between of  1952 and 2004 was about ranged from 5% to 10%.
The percentage women’s representation had increased to 12% in 2014 and stands at 13.6% in the 18th Lok Sabha while in the Rajya Sabha (upper house), the figure is 13%.
Constitutional Amendments:
The 73rd and 74th amendments in 1992/1993 provided one-third reservation for women in panchayats and municipalities, but similar reservations for the Lok Sabha and State assemblies have not been successful until recently.
Note:
The global average of 26.9% of women in National parliaments.
Women’s Representation in State Legislatures:
No state has more than 20% women representation in its legislative assembly.
Chhattisgarh has the highest representation with 18% women MLAs.
Himachal Pradesh has just one woman MLA and Mizoram has none.
Should political parties provide internal reservations to increase women’s political participation?
Globally, higher representation for women is achieved through voluntary or legislated compulsory quotas for candidates within political parties or reserved seats in parliament.
So, quotas within political parties offer more democratic choices to voters and flexibility in candidate selection. It means quota in Political parties could be the most important step to increase women’s representation in Parliament.
Some parties, like Naam Tamilar Katchi in Tamil Nadu, have adopted voluntary quotas (50% for women candidates), but such measures alone have not significantly improved overall representation.
When will the 106th constitutional amendment be implemented?
The 106th Amendment Act provides for 33% reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies, including the Delhi Legislative Assembly.
The reservation will come into effect
after an exercise of delimitation is undertaken following the first census conducted
after the commencement of the 106th Amendment Act.
The women’s reservation will be in operation for a period of 15 years from its commencement.
Way Forward:
Public Awareness and Advocacy:
Need to conduct widespread awareness campaigns to highlight the importance of gender equality in political representation.
Capacity Building and Support Mechanisms:
Need to implement comprehensive capacity-building programs aimed at empowering women politically. For example,provide training in leadership skills, campaign management, and legislative processes.
Mains PYQ:
The reservation of seats for women in the institutions of local self-government has had a limited impact on the patriarchal character of the Indian Political Process.” Comment.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Agronomy; Food production;
Mains level:
Challenges in Farm Sector; Value Chains;
Why in the News?
India holds the position of the second-largest agricultural producer globally however, it only accounts for 2.4% of global agricultural exports, ranking eighth worldwide due to the post-harvest loss.
A closer look at India’s post-harvest loss:
Economic Impact:
India faces annual post-harvest losses amounting to approximately ₹1,52,790 crore, significantly impacting farmer incomes and the agricultural economy.
Perishable Commodities:
The biggest losses occur in perishable commodities like
livestock produce (22%), fruits (19%), and vegetables (18%)
. Export processes further add to these losses, particularly at the import-country stage.
Supply Chain Inefficiencies:
There is Inefficiencies in storage, transportation, and marketing, alongside a lack of assured market connectivity, contribute to significant post-harvest losses. Small and marginal farmers, who make up 86% of the farming community, struggle with economies of scale and market access.
Initiatives taken by the Railways Department:
Truck-on-Train Service:
Indian Railways introduced the truck-on-train service, allowing loaded trucks to be transported on railway wagons. This service has been expanded following successful trials with commodities like milk and cattle feed.
Parcel Special Trains:
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Railways introduced parcel special trains to transport perishables and seeds between producers and markets, ensuring timely delivery and reducing post-harvest losses.
DFI (Doubling farmers’ income)
committee recommends streamlining loading and unloading processes to minimize transit times and address staffing shortages through recruitment and training initiatives.
Kisan Rail Scheme:
It was launched to connect production surplus regions with consumption regions. This scheme facilitates the transportation of perishables (including milk, meat, and fish) more efficiently.
Specialized Wagons and Facilities:
Investment in specialized wagons for temperature-controlled transport and establishing rail-side facilities for safe cargo handling are essential steps taken by the Railways.
Way for Untapped Opportunities:
Enhanced Environmental Benefits
: Rail transport generates up to 80% less carbon dioxide for freight traffic compared to road transport.
Public-Private Partnerships:
The private sector can play a crucial role in enhancing operational efficiency and strengthening rail infrastructure through public-private partnerships, thereby improving the overall logistics ecosystem for agricultural produce.
Budgetary Support and Infrastructure Development:
The budgetary allocation for agriculture in 2024 aims to bridge the farm-to-market gap with modern infrastructure and value-addition support.
Technology Integration:
Incorporating advanced technologies like real-time tracking, temperature monitoring, and automated loading/unloading systems.
Way forward:
Expand climate-controlled storage facilities and cold storage capacity to accommodate a larger share of agricultural produce.
Provide small and marginal farmers access to storage facilities through cooperatives or subsidies.
Invest in specialized rail wagons for temperature-controlled transport and establish rail-side cargo handling facilities.
Mains PYQ:
How do subsidies affect the cropping pattern, crop diversity and economy of farmers? What is the significance of crop insurance, minimum support price and food processing for small and marginal farmers?

**********The problems with sub-caste reservations
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Population of SC and ST in India
Mains level:
Objective of reservation
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court has reserved its decision on
sub-caste reservations for SC/STs
. Any ruling on this matter must be substantiated not only legally but also academically.
What is the Sub-categorization of castes?
It refers to the practice of further dividing larger caste categories into smaller groups or sub-groups based on specific criteria such as socio-economic status, geographical location, historical background, or specific needs for policy implementation.
Background of the Case:
The case involves the
validity of sub-classification within the SC and ST categories
for providing reservations in government jobs and education.
In 2004 Supreme Court strikes down
Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000
, citing violation of the
right to equality
E.V.
Chinnaiah v State of Andhra Pradesh case
and emphasised that the SC list should be treated as a single, homogeneous group
Only Parliament
has the power to sub-classify SCs and STs for reservations
The Supreme Court is now considering
whether states have the power to create sub-classifications
within these reserved categories.
The case stems from a
1975 Punjab government notification
that divided its 25% reservation for SCs into two categories: half for
Balmikis (Valmikis) and Mazhabi Sikhs,
and the other half for the remaining groups within the SC category.
Objectives behind the implementation of reservations and present SC scenario:
Objective of Reservations:
The primary objective of reservations, as advocated by
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar,
is to
ensure equitable representation and opportunities
for historically marginalized communities, particularly Scheduled Castes (SCs).
Present SC scenario:
Despite reservations, certain sub-castes within SCs continue to face challenges in securing adequate representation in jobs and education. This under-representation is often attributed to factors such as inadequate educational opportunities, economic disparities, and historical discrimination.
The policy of economic empowerment in India and its associated challenges:
Policies for Economic Empowerment:
These policies complement reservations by focusing on enhancing the ownership of capital assets (like land and businesses) and improving educational attainment among SC individuals
For example, Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS), National Scheduled Castes Finance & Development Corporation (NSFDC) and National Safai Karamcharis Finance & Development Corporation (NSKFDC).
These policies are aimed at building capabilities and enabling greater participation in economic activities.
Challenges:
There are challenges in implementing economic empowerment policies including inadequate access to credit and financial resources, lack of skill development initiatives, and persistent socio-economic barriers that hinder the upward mobility of SC communities.
Intersection with Reservations:
Integrating economic empowerment with reservations is crucial to ensure that individuals from SC backgrounds not only secure reserved positions but also have the necessary skills and resources to thrive in competitive environments.
What must be our focus? (Way Forward)
Holistic Approach:
There is a need for a holistic approach that combines reservations with targeted economic and educational interventions. This approach should address both systemic discrimination and socio-economic barriers faced by SC communities.
Capacity Building:
There should be emphasis on enhancing the educational infrastructure and skill development programs tailored to the needs of SC individuals.
Data-Driven Policy:
The policy decisions related to sub-caste reservations should be informed by empirical data that assesses the actual impact of discrimination versus socio-economic factors on under-representation.
Mains PYQ:
Whether National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) can enforce the implementation of constitutional reservation for the Scheduled Castes in the religious minority institutions? Examine

Scientists have confirmed the presence of a cave on the Moon, near the site of the first lunar landing 55 years ago.
This discovery could provide astronauts with a potential habitat on the Moon in the future.
About the Cave on Mare Tranquillitatis
A study titled “
Radar evidence of an accessible cave conduit on the Moon below the Mare Tranquillitatis pit
” was published in the journal Nature Astronomy.
The study established the
presence of a moon cave
at the
Sea of
Tranquillity
, a large, dark, basaltic plain on the Moon’s surface.
The cave is
located 400 kilometers
from where astronauts
Neil Armstrong
Buzz Aldrin landed in 1969.
It is roughly
45 meters wide
up to 80 meters long
, with an area
equivalent to 14 tennis courts
Research Method
Researchers analyzed
photos taken in
2010
by NASA’s
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft.
They concluded that the
pit was the entry point to a cave created by the collapse of a lava tube
, a tunnel formed when molten lava flows beneath a field of cooled lava.
Back2Basics:
NASA launched the LRO on June 18,
2009
LRO’s primary mission is
to map the Moon’s surface in high detail
to identify safe landing sites and locate potential resources.
It is equipped with
seven scientific instruments
, including a camera, a laser altimeter, and a radiation detector.
LRO has provided critical data on
lunar topography, temperature, and radiation levels
, significantly enhancing our understanding of the Moon.
Characteristics of Lunar Caves
Craters are bowl-shaped

asteroid or comet
strikes.
Pits
, in contrast, appear as
massive steep-walled depressions
At least
200 such pits have been discovered
16 believed to have formed from collapsed lava tubes
due to volcanic activity over a billion years ago.
Benefits for Human Exploration
The Moon is exposed to
solar radiation 150 times stronger than Earth
The lunar surface heats to about
127 degrees Celsius
during the day and
cools to around -173 degrees Celsius at night.
Caves, however,
maintain stable average temperatures
of around 17 degrees Celsius.
They could
shield human explorers from radiation and micrometeorites
, making them viable for future lunar bases or emergency shelters.
Challenges and Further Research
depth
of such caves could present challenges for accessibility.
There are risks of potential
avalanches
cave-ins
Need for Further Research
Further research is needed to understand and map the structural stability of the caves.
This could be done using ground-penetrating radar, robots, or cameras.
To become viable habitats, caves would need systems to monitor movement or seismic activity and safety zones for astronauts in case of a cave collapse.
