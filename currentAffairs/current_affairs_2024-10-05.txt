India’s 5 new classical languages
Why in news?
The Union Cabinet has extended the “classical language” tag to Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali.
Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia already enjoy this status
What’s in today’s article?
Background – the concept of classical language
Criteria for the Designation of a Classical Language
Addition of 5 new classical languages
Significance of classical tag
In response to demands from various states, in 2004, the then government established the category of "classical languages" and set criteria for this status.
Tamil became the first Indian language to receive this designation
on October 12, 2004, due to its antiquity and rich literary tradition.
In November 2004, the Ministry of Culture formed a Linguistic Experts Committee (LEC) under the Sahitya Akademi to assess proposals for classical language status.
was declared a classical language on November 25, 2004, followed by
Telugu and Kannada
in 2008, Malayalam in 2013, and
in 2014.
Latest criteria for classical languages
Recently, in July 2024, the Linguistic Experts Committee (LEC) unanimously revised the criteria for classical status. The criteria now include:
High antiquity of early texts
, and recorded history over a period of 1500- 2000 years;
A body of ancient literature/ texts, which is considered a heritage by generations of speakers;
Epigraphic and inscriptional evidence;
Knowledge texts, especially prose texts in addition to poetry; and
That classical languages and literature could be distinct from its current form or could be discontinuous with later forms of its offshoots.
Following the new criteria, the committee recommended the addition of the five new classical languages, the proposals for which had been with the Centre for some years.
This was approved by the Union Cabinet recently.
The inclusion of Marathi as a classical language comes over a decade after the state government proposed it to the Centre in 2013.
Modern Marathi evolved from
Maharashtri Prakrit
a dialect used in western India and the official language of the Satvahanas
While some scholars claim it was the first Prakrit language, this is contested.
The earliest evidence
of Maharashtri Prakrit is a 1st-century BCE stone inscription in Pune
, and modern Marathi traces back to a 739 CE copper-plate inscription in Satara.
Bengali & Assamese
The governments of West Bengal and Assam have also sought classical language status for Bengali and Assamese.
Both languages originated from Magadhi Prakrit, the official language of the Magadha court in East India.
Their emergence is debated, with estimates ranging from the 6th to 12th centuries.
Prakrit & Pali
Prakrit refers to a group of closely-related Indo-Aryan languages spoken by the masses, in contrast to the elite language Sanskrit.
Historian A.L. Basham noted that by the Buddha's time, simpler Prakrit dialects were in use.
These vernaculars were key in the spread of heterodox religions like Jainism and Buddhism.
Jain scriptures, such as the agamas and Gatha Saptashati, were written in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit, which still holds significance in Jain rituals.
Pali, derived from Magadhi Prakrit, became the language of the Theravada Buddhist Canon, Tipitakas, and remains in use in Theravada Buddhist countries like Sri Lanka and Myanmar.
The designation of classical languages will have both national and international cultural and academic impacts.
The Ministry of Education has taken steps to promote these languages, establishing three Central Universities in 2020 for Sanskrit and setting up the Central Institute of Classical Tamil in 2008 to translate ancient texts and offer courses.
Centres of Excellence have also been created for Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, and Odia.
The newly designated classical languages will receive similar support.
The National Education Policy encourages the inclusion of classical languages in school curricula.
Collaborations between the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Education, and state governments will focus on research and knowledge-sharing.
Additionally, manuscripts in these languages will be digitised to enhance accessibility for scholars.

**********SC junks pleas against verdict allowing states to levy tax on minerals
Why in news?
The Supreme Court, in a nine-judge Constitution Bench, dismissed review petitions against its earlier ruling that royalty paid by mining operators to the Central government is not a tax, and that states can impose cesses on mining activities.
The bench, with the exception of Justice BV Nagarathna who dissented, found no error in the original judgment, thus rejecting the review petitions.
What’s in today’s article?
Background
Key highlights of the July 2024 judgement
Background of the case
Mining and Royalties
Royalties refer to the fees paid to the owner of a product in exchange for the right to use that product.
The issue of whether royalties on mining activities constitute a tax has been a longstanding legal question in India.
Under Section 9 of the
Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDRA),
entities holding mining leases are required to pay royalties to the owner of the land, which could be a state government.
This raised the question of
whether these royalties are a form of tax when the state is the lessor
The Supreme Court first addressed this question in the 1989
The Supreme Court first addressed this question in the 1989 case
India Cement Ltd v State of Tamil Nadu
A seven-judge Bench heard a challenge by the company to a Tamil Nadu law imposing a cess on land revenues, including royalties.
A cess is a form of tax levied by the government on tax with specific purposes.
The court ruled that while states can collect royalties, they cannot impose taxes on mining activities, as the
Central government has overriding authority
over the regulation of mines and mineral development under
Entry 54 of the Union List
In this judgement, the apex court opined that
royalty is a tax
, and as such a cess on royalty being a tax on royalty, is beyond the competence of the State Legislature.
The court controversially stated, "royalty is a tax," leading to questions about the interpretation of royalties as a tax.
2004 case State of West Bengal v Kesoram Industries Ltd
This statement sparked further legal debate and confusion, leading to the 2004 case State of West Bengal v Kesoram Industries Ltd.
Here, a five-judge Constitution Bench identified a
typographical error in the India Cement decision
, clarifying that it should have stated "cess on royalty is a tax" rather than "royalty is a tax."
The court held that royalties themselves are not taxes but could not overrule the India Cement decision
due to the smaller size of the bench
2011 Mineral Area Development Authority case
In 2011, during the Mineral Area Development Authority case, the Supreme Court noted the conflict between the Kesoram Industries and India Cement rulings.
Recognizing the direct implications for the case at hand, the court referred the
matter to a nine-judge bench to conclusively determine whether royalties are a form of tax
July 2024 Judgement of SC
In July 2024, a nine-judge bench ruled by majority that states have legislative competence to levy taxes on minerals and mineral-bearing lands in addition to the royalty imposed by the Centre.
Review petition filed
A review petition was later filed against the July 2024 judgment, which was recently rejected.
Key highlights of the July 2024 SC judgement
Royalty vs. Tax
: The court emphasized that royalty is not a tax. It is a consideration paid to the government for the right to extract minerals, unlike taxes, which are sovereign impositions.
Enhancement of royalty is not an imposition of a tax
: Since the royalty paid under Section 9 is not a tax on mineral rights, any limitation on the enhancement of royalty is not an imposition of a tax under Entry 50 of List 2. Section 9 limits power of the centre and it does not govern tax.
States' Taxing Power
: The court upheld that states retain the power to impose taxes on mineral rights, unless Parliament explicitly limits this power.
Mines Act
: The Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act does not strip states of their power to tax mineral rights.
Parliament's Role
: While Parliament can impose restrictions on state taxation through statutory instruments, the court ruled that the current scheme of the MMRDA Act does not interfere with the states' taxing authority.
Parliament can impose limitations under Entry 50 of List 2 of the Constitution by means of statutory instruments
Entry 50 of List 2 of the Constitution of India is about taxes on mineral rights, subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development.
Land and Minerals
: Mineral-bearing lands fall under the term "land" as per Entry 49 of List 2 of the Constitution, enabling states to tax such lands.

**********How Elephants are Counted, Why Methods Need a Rethink
Why in the News?
The Environment Ministry has shelved its elephant census report, ‘Status of Elephant in India 2022-23’, citing a delay in the census in the Northeast.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Elephant Conservation (Importance, Current Status, Challenges, Govt. Initiatives, etc.)
News Summary
Elephant Conservation in India:
Elephants are not only iconic species in India but also an integral part of the country’s ecological and cultural heritage.
Designated as the
National Heritage Animal of India
, the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) holds immense significance.
However, the species is under increasing threat due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching, making their conservation a priority for India.
Importance of Elephant Conservation:
Keystone Species
Elephants play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of their habitats.
They are considered keystone species because their activities, such as seed dispersal and tree-felling, shape the forest ecosystems they inhabit.
Tourism and Economy
Elephants attract global tourism, especially in wildlife sanctuaries and national parks.
Tourism related to elephant safaris and wildlife watching significantly contributes to the local economy.
Current Status of Elephant Populations in India:
As of the
last reported census in 2017
, India is home to
approximately 27,312 wild elephants
, spread across four major landscapes:
North-Eastern India:
Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and other north-eastern states.
Eastern-Central India:
Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh.
Southern India:
Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.
Northern India:
Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.
"Status of Elephants in India 2022-23"
report, though delayed, is expected to reveal a decline in elephant numbers, especially in states like West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Kerala.
Initial reports indicate that elephant populations in some of these states have dropped by
50-80%
due to habitat degradation and other anthropogenic pressures.
Challenges Facing Elephant Conservation:
Habitat Loss and Fragmentation
Rapid deforestation, urbanization, and development projects like mining and linear infrastructure (roads and railways) have led to shrinking elephant habitats.
Fragmented landscapes disrupt migration corridors, increasing human-elephant conflict.
Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC)
As human populations encroach upon elephant habitats, incidents of human-elephant conflict have risen.
Elephants often raid agricultural fields, leading to crop damage and, in some cases, human casualties. This conflict has led to retaliatory killings and injuries to elephants.
Poaching and Illegal Trade
Elephants are poached for their ivory, although trade in ivory is banned in India. Other threats include electrocution from low-hanging power lines and accidents with trains.
Climate Change
Changing weather patterns affect the availability of food and water for elephants. Droughts and erratic rainfall patterns impact both their natural habitats and the communities living near them.
Government Initiatives for Elephant Conservation:
Recognizing the need for concerted conservation efforts, the
Government of India
has implemented a range of policies and initiatives to protect elephants and their habitats.
Project Elephant (1992)
Launched in
is a flagship conservation initiative of the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC).
The primary objectives of Project Elephant include:
Protecting elephants, their habitats, and migration corridors.
Addressing human-elephant conflict.
Ensuring the welfare of captive elephants.
works in collaboration with states that have significant elephant populations.
These states include Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, Assam, and West Bengal.
Under the project, several initiatives are undertaken to monitor elephant populations, restore degraded habitats, and create awareness about the importance of elephant conservation.
Elephant Corridors
India has identified
101 elephant corridors
across the country that are critical for ensuring safe movement of elephants between habitats.
These corridors reduce habitat fragmentation and help mitigate human-elephant conflict.
Asian Nature Conservation Foundation (ANCF)
Wildlife Trust of India (WTI)
, along with the government, work on securing these corridors.
Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE)
is an international program under the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)
India is part of this initiative to monitor the illegal killing of elephants and gather data on poaching to curb the ivory trade.
Gaj Yatra Campaign
is a nationwide campaign launched by the
and MoEFCC to raise awareness about the importance of elephant conservation and protecting elephant corridors.
The campaign promotes coexistence between humans and elephants.
National Elephant Action Plan (NEAP)
The NEAP, launched by the MoEFCC, provides a comprehensive framework for long-term management of wild elephants.
It focuses on scientific research, conflict management, habitat conservation, and strengthening anti-poaching measures.
2022-23 elephant census report:
The Environment Ministry has delayed the release of the
, primarily because the census in the
is not yet complete.
Although the report for the rest of India has been printed, it will not be made public until
June 2025
Key Findings:
Elephant populations
have sharply declined in the
east-central
southern regions
For example, elephant numbers in
have dropped by 84%, in
by 64%, in
by 54%, and in
by 51%.
The report blames
like mining and infrastructure construction for threatening elephant habitats.
Counting Methods:
The census used improved counting methods, including
DNA profiling
However, experts argue that these new methods alone do not fully explain the large decline in elephant numbers.
Previous counting methods, like the
"total direct count"
"indirect dung count"
, had limitations but are important for tracking trends over time.
Why the Delay is a Problem:
Experts are concerned that the
delay will harm conservation efforts
They believe that the government should release the available data to guide policy and interventions.
In some regions, like
, threats like mining and low-hanging power lines have caused significant harm to elephant populations, and timely action is critical.

**********What are Pumped Hydropower Projects?
Why in News?
The Union Environment Ministry’s expert panel has decided that it will not grant final clearances to pumped hydropower projects proposed in the Western Ghats region without site visits.
With the fragile ecology of the Western Ghats in mind, this will ascertain the impact of such projects on the environment.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Pumped Hydropower Project?
PSH Projects in India
Concerns Regarding PSPs in Western Ghats
About:
Pumped hydropower projects, also known as
pumped storage hydropower (PSH)
projects, are large-scale energy storage systems that
use water to generate and store electricity.
It is the most dominant form of energy storage on the electric grid today.
Working:
a configuration of two water reservoirs
at different elevations that can generate power as water moves down from one to the other (discharge), passing through a turbine.
The system also requires power
as it pumps water back into the upper reservoir (recharge).
PSH acts similarly to a giant battery
, because it can store power and then release it when needed.
Types:
Open-loop
PSH systems connect a reservoir to a
naturally flowing water feature
via a tunnel, using a turbine/pump and generator/motor to move water and create electricity.
Closed-loop
PSH systems connect two reservoirs without flowing water features via a tunnel, using a turbine/pump and generator/motor to move water and create electricity.
Benefits:
Grid stability:
PSH projects help balance the grid during periods of high demand or low supply.
Renewable energy integration:
PSH projects help integrate renewable energy sources into the grid.
Challenges:
High start-up cost; meticulous design and planning; environmental and regulatory constraints, etc.
PSH Projects in India:
The Central government has pushed for the
expansion of pumped storage project’s (PSPs) capacities
to plug the variability of solar and wind energy in the electricity grid.
The Central Electricity Authority of India
(CEA) has estimated the on-river pumped storage hydro
potential
in India to be about
103 GW
The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (
MoEFCC
) has recently given the environment-related go-ahead to pumped storage hydropower projects with a capacity of
11.98 gigawatts (Gw).
The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) on River Valley and Hydroelectric Projects (one of the 11 sectoral panels that grant prior environmental permissions) gave approval to the -
Greenko Energy’s 3.66 Gw project in
UP’s Sonbhadra district
, which is the largest project to receive an environment clearance recommendation.
Two projects with capacities of 1.2 Gw each, belonging to
Sterlite Grid and Gandhwani Energy in Chhattisgarh
, received recommendations.
One project of
Oju Subansiri Hydro Power Corporation
of 2.22 Gw for Arunachal Pradesh and one project of
JSW Energy of 1.5 Gw for Maharashtra
were also given the nod.
This marks the largest tranche of these new-tech energy storage projects to be approved in one go in the country.
Concerns Regarding PSPs in Western Ghats:
The EAC on river valley and hydroelectric projects noted that
the MoEFCC had granted terms of reference (ToR) or preliminary permissions
to 15 PSPs in the Western Ghats.
The preliminary permissions spell out the scope of the environmental impact assessment studies that are to be carried out for mandatory public hearings before the projects are considered for final environmental clearance.
Some of these PSPs fall in villages identified as eco-sensitive areas in the government’s draft notification on the protection of the Western Ghats.
As these projects
may adversely affect the biodiversity and forests
in the fragile Western Ghats, the EAC decided that site visits should be carried out to ensure
thorough scrutiny.

It is also one of the world’s largest rivers in terms of discharge.
Course:
Origin
: It originates in
several headstreams

Researchers recently developed DNA molecules which contain "invisibility cloak" sequences which can selectively target diseased cells in motor neuron disease.
About Motor Neuron Disease (MND):
It is a
rare condition
that
progressively damages
parts of the
nervous system
This
leads to
muscle weakness
, often with visible wasting.
MND is also
called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

stop working properly
and die prematurely. This is known as
neurodegeneration
Motor neurons instruct the muscles to move by passing on signals from the brain. They play a role in both conscious and automatic movements, such as swallowing and breathing.
As MND progresses, it can become more difficult to do some or all of these activities.
Generally, MND is believed to be caused by a
combination of environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors.
20%
of cases are linked to
genetic causes.
Half of the genetic cases will be in people who have a family history of MND.
It mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s, but it can affect adults of all ages.
Symptoms:

What is System of Environmental-Economic Accounting?
It is an agreed
international statistical standard
for describing the
interaction
between the
economy and the environment
, as well as the stocks and changes in stocks of environmental assets
It aims to integrate perspectives from other disciplines and, where relevant, provide an improved body of information for environmental economic accounts.
There are two sides of SEEA–the SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) and the SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA)
SEEA-Central Framework:
It focuses on the
individual components
of the environment that provide material and space for all economic activities.
SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting:
It is a complementary framework of SEEA-CF and constitutes an integrated and comprehensive statistical framework for organising data about habitats and landscapes, measuring the ecosystem services, tracking changes in the ecosystem assets and linking this information to economic and other human activity.

**********How circular migration can help meet global skill shortages and lift Indians out of poverty?
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
What is circular migration;
Mains level:
Significance of circular migration;
Why in the News?
Maharashtra’s 997 youth, earning Rs 1.37 lakh in Israel, engage in circular migration, boosting skills through labour mobility agreements.
What is the “triple win” scenario associated with circular migration?
Migrants
win by gaining high-paying jobs, improving their skills, and getting social security benefits while working abroad.
The home country (like India)
wins because when the workers return, they bring back new skills and experience that help improve local industries.
The host country (like Israel or Germany)
wins because they get the skilled workers they need to fill labour shortages without facing long-term migration issues.
How does circular migration contribute to skill development and poverty alleviation for Indian migrants?
Skill Development:
Indian workers gain exposure to international work environments, cutting-edge technology, and management protocols, which enhance their skills and employability.
Poverty Alleviation:
Higher wages in developed countries allow migrants to send
remittances
back home, improving the economic conditions of their families and contributing to poverty alleviation.
In what way does circular migration mitigate the issue of brain drain?
Temporary Nature:
Since workers return after a set period (e.g., five years), they bring back their enhanced skills and experience, preventing a permanent loss of talent to foreign nations.
Knowledge Transfer:
Returning workers contribute to domestic industries by applying the new skills and technologies they learned abroad, benefiting the home economy.
What are the policy implications for implementing circular migration effectively? (Way forward)
Skill Matching and Training:
Governments must ensure exact skill matching between
migrant workers
and the requirements of the
destination countries
, providing refresher courses and training as needed.
Government-to-Government Agreements:
Strong bilateral agreements are essential to safeguard the rights of workers, ensure fair wages, and provide
in the destination countries.
Streamlined Procedures:
Policies should simplify legal compliances, fast-track passport issuance, and remove barriers like language skills through training in languages such as Japanese, German, or French.
Conclusion:
Circular migration offers a “triple win” by benefiting migrants, home countries, and host nations. It enhances skills, boosts incomes, mitigates brain drain, and fosters knowledge transfer, provided there is proper policy support, skill matching, and streamlined processes.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Brain mapping of fruit flies and its applications
Why in the News?
Researcher have successfully mapped the
entire brain of an adult
fruit fly
, marking the first time researchers have created such a detailed map of an adult animal’s brain.
How Was the Fruit Fly Brain Mapped?
The process of mapping Fruit Flies
(
Drosophila melanogaster
)
brain began in
2013
Scientists dunked the brain of an
adult fruit fly
in a
chemical bath
, hardening it into a solid block.
This process involved
7,050 sections
of the brain and produced
21 million photos
to map the entire brain.
The first
high-resolution image
of the brain was created
more than a decade
after the work started.
Key findings
Scientists identified
more than 50 million connections
between
139,000 neurons
(brain nerve cells).
They classified the cells into
8,453 distinct types
, making it the
largest catalogue of cell types
in any brain.
The research gave insights into how different types of cells function and how the fruit fly’s eyes process
motion and color
A group of
“hub neurons”
was discovered, which may help speed up information flow.
Significance of the Work
Although the human brain is more complex, the
logic of how
neurons communicate
is similar between fruit flies and humans.
Fruit flies
are a valuable
model system
for neuroscience. Their brains solve many of the same problems that human brains do.
It could help in understanding and
treat mental health conditions
like Parkinson’s and depression.
The mapping of the fruit fly’s brain raises hopes that scientists will eventually be able to
map the entire human brain
