**********Mount Fuji
Japan's Mount Fuji remained snow-less recently, the latest date that its majestic slopes have been bare since records began 130 years ago.
About Mount Fuji:
Mount Fuji, also known as Fuji-san, is the
highest mountain in Japan
, standing at 3,776 meters.
It is situated
close to the Pacific coast
in the Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures in the heart of the large island of Honshu, about 100km to the southwest of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area.
Unlike other famous high-elevation mountains in the world, Mt. Fuji is
not part of a large mountain range.
It is a
stratovolcano
that has been dormant since its last eruption in 1707 but is still generally classified as active by geologists.
It has a
prominent summit crater
and is constructed from innumerable basaltic lava flows, each a few meters thick.
smooth slope and a wide, spreading base
, creating a beautiful skyline as it narrows to a magnificent peak.
It is said that the main cause of Mt. Fuji's volcanic activity is the Pacific Plate sinking under the bottom of the Philippine Plate.
On the northern slopes
of Mount Fuji lie the
Fuji Five Lakes
(Fuji Goko), comprising, east to west, Lake Yamanaka, Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Sai, Lake Shōji, and Lake Motosu, all formed by the damming effects of lava flows.
Despite its active volcanic nature, Fuji’s summit is
covered in snow most times of the year.
The mountain is the major
feature of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park
, and it is at the centre of a
UNESCO World Heritage
site designated in 2013.

**********Raigad Fort
A replica of Raigad Fort has been made as backdrop at the venue of Rashtriya Ekta Diwas parade in Kevadiya to showcase the stories of incredible valour, heroic deeds and innovative warfare techniques of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
About Raigad Fort:
It is a hill fort situated in the Raigad district
, Maharashtra.
It is surrounded by
valleys shaped by
Kal and Gandhari rivers
, stands as an isolated massif without connections to neighbouring hills.
Grant Duff, a British historian
of the Maratha period has drawn parallels between Raigad and
the Rock of Gibraltar.
He has gone to the extent of labelling Raigad as the
Gibraltar of the east.
History
In
1653 CE,
Raigad (then known as Rairi) was captured by the Maratha forces from the
Mores'.
Shivaji Maharaj assigned the work of reconstruction of the fort to
Hiroji Indulkar.
Subsquently, on
6th June, 1674 CE
a grand
coronation ceremony
of Shivaji Maharaj was held on Raigad post, during which he attained the title of
“Chhatrapati”.
The fort served as the second capital of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and played an important role in the administration and expansion of the Maratha Kingdom.

**********The burgeoning expenditure of elections
Why in news?
The estimated total expenditure for the upcoming U.S. presidential and Congressional elections in November 2024 is approximately
$16 billion
(around
₹1,36,000 crores
).
In contrast, the total expenditure by various political parties for the recent general election to the Lok Sabha in India was about
₹1,00,000 crores
, according to the Centre for Media Studies (CMS). This raises various debates surrounding campaign finance (election expenditure) in India.
What’s in today’s article?
Legislations Governing Campaign Finance in India
Election expenditure limit in India
Associated challenges
Way forward
Background
The issue of election funding was not specifically addressed during the Constituent Assembly debates (1946-1950).
The first significant laws governing election funding were the
Representation of People Act, 1950
, and
Representation of People Act, 1951
It does not impose limits on expenditure for political party leaders in disseminating messages.
Candidates must maintain accounts of their election expenditures, but political parties are not required to maintain such accounts for promoting official programs.
However, parties must disclose contributions over ₹20,000 to income tax authorities and cannot accept donations from government companies or foreign sources.
Election and Other Related Laws (Amendment) Act, 2003
The 2003 Amendment introduced Section 29C, requiring political party treasurers to prepare annual financial reports detailing donations over ₹20,000.
These reports must be submitted to the Election Commission before submitting audited accounts to the Income Tax authorities.
Non-compliance leads to disqualification from tax relief under the Income Tax Act.
Companies Act, 1956
Under Section 293-A of the Companies Act, 1956, corporate contributions to political parties are
limited to five percent of the company's average net profits over the last three years
Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976
FCRA prohibits political organizations from receiving foreign contributions.
Income Tax Act, 1961
Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, contributions to political parties are deductible from income tax calculations.
Section 13A mandates that political parties submit annual audited accounts to the Income Tax authorities by a specified date.
Existing limit
The election expenditure limit for candidates is ₹95 lakh per Lok Sabha constituency in larger States and ₹75 lakh in smaller States.
With respect to Legislative Assemblies, they are ₹40 lakh and ₹28 lakh for larger and smaller States respectively.
These limits are set, from time to time, by the Election Commission (EC). There are no limits on the expenditure of political parties during elections.
Purpose and Reality of Expenditure Limits
While limits aim to minimize the influence of wealth in elections and ensure a level playing field, the effectiveness is questionable.
The Representation of the People Act mandates candidates keep accurate spending records within these limits and submit affidavits post-election.
However, analysis from the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) shows most
candidates report spending far below the limits, raising doubts about transparency
Political Party Spending — The "Elephant in the Room"
Currently, no cap exists on political parties’ expenditures during elections, which can indirectly favor wealthy candidates.
Experts argue that real reform requires transparency in party finances and internal democratization to achieve genuine equality for all candidates.
Possible gap between actual and reported costs
The official expenditures declared by the BJP and Congress for the 2019 election were ₹1,264 crores and ₹820 crores, respectively. However, according to a report by the CMS, ₹50,000 crore was spent by various parties during the 2019 election.
The report suggests that 35% of this money was spent on campaigns and publicity, while
25% was illegally distributed among voters
Unholy nexus between the elected representatives and donors
Elections across the world democracies have become very expensive.
Such increased expenditure that is met primarily through large donations creates an unholy nexus between the elected representatives and donors who seek favours.
Creates an entry barrier into electoral politics
Expensive elections act as an entry barrier into electoral politics for many well-meaning citizens.
Advocacy for State Funding of Elections
The Indrajit Gupta Committee (1998) and the Law Commission report (1999) have proposed state funding of elections,
They suggested that the government should partially cover the election expenses of candidates nominated by recognized political parties.
However, doubts remain regarding the feasibility and implementation of this measure in the current context.
Simultaneous Elections as a Solution
Simultaneous elections are often viewed as a potential solution to the rising costs of elections.
While this approach may help reduce campaign and publicity expenditures, it faces
challenges related to federalism and the need for constitutional amendments
Moreover, without effective measures to curb illegal cash distribution to voters, simultaneous elections alone may not significantly impact overall election expenditures.
Proposed Electoral Reforms
The Election Commission's 2016 report on proposed electoral reforms outlines practical steps to create a more equitable environment concerning election expenditures:
Regulating Financial Assistance
: Amend the law to ensure that any financial assistance provided by political parties to their candidates falls within the candidates' prescribed expenditure limits.
Ceiling on Party Expenditures
: Establish a ceiling on the total expenditures of political parties, set at no more than the expenditure limit for individual candidates multiplied by the number of candidates from that party contesting the election.
Expediting Legal Processes
: Appoint additional judges in High Courts to facilitate the speedy disposal of election-related cases, serving as a deterrent against violations of expenditure norms.
Need for Bipartisan Support
These reforms require bipartisan political support and prompt implementation to be effective in addressing the challenges associated with election financing in India.

**********What Challenges does India Face in Fertilizer Imports?
Why in the News?
India is currently grappling with significant challenges in meeting its fertilizer demands due to dependency on imports, especially amidst the ongoing Ukraine and Gaza crises, which could further impact fertilizer availability and prices.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Fertilizers (Meaning, Utility, Types)
Fertilizer Imports (Current Scenario, Trends, Strategic Initiatives, Suggestions, etc.)
About Fertilizers:
A fertilizer is a
chemical product either mined or manufactured material containing one or more essential plant nutrients that are immediately or potentially available in sufficiently good amounts
Fertilizers have played an essential role in agricultural production, providing vital nutrients for crops, increasing demands over the years.
As an agrarian country, India is home to numerous small and marginal farmers and is often plagued by low productivity and low quality.
Crops are mainly rain-fed and cultivated on a single piece of land over time, decreasing soil fertility in many regions.
Thereby, increasing quantities of nitrogen fertilizers have been used in the country.
Macro & Micro Elements in Fertilizers:
Macro Nutrients
: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potash (K), Calcium, Sulfur (S), and Magnesium are known as macro-nutrients (required in comparatively larger amounts).
Micro Nutrients
: Iron (Fe), Zinc (Zn), Copper, Boron, Manganese Molybdenum, Chloride, and others are the micro-nutrients (required in a smaller quantity) for the growth and development of crop plants.
Among the various types
, NPK
(nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) fertilizers are the most common ones, and
Urea
stands as the most highly consumed fertilizer in India.
India is the second-largest consumer of fertilizers globally, with an annual consumption of more than 55.0 million metric ton
Current Fertilizer Import Scenario:
India’s domestic fertilizer production does not meet its full demand, creating a dependency on imports. As per the
2023 Standing Committee of Parliament report
: 20% of the domestic requirement is imported.
Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)
: 50-60% of the demand is met through imports.
Muriate of Potash (MOP)
: 100% dependency on imports.
The report stresses a need for self-reliance in fertilizer production to stabilize supplies.
Production and Consumption Trends:
annual fertilizer consumption
2021-22
was
579.67 lakh metric tonnes (LMT)
, with:
: 341.73 LMT
: 92.64 LMT
: 23.93 LMT
NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium)
: 121.37 LMT
Domestic production for the year totalled
435
95 LMT
, leaving a shortfall of
143.72 LMT
. Notably, MOP is entirely imported due to the lack of local production.
Impact of the Ukraine and Gaza Conflicts:
Experts, at the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
, highlighted potential volatility in fertilizer prices due to the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts. This unrest could:
Affect
oil prices
, impacting petroleum-based fertilizer production.
Disrupt imports from
Russia
West Asia
, two significant suppliers for India’s fertilizer imports.
Financial Burden of Fertilizer Subsidies:
The Indian government has allocated substantial funds to support fertilizer affordability. In the
2023-24 Budget
Total subsidy
: ₹1.79 lakh crore.
Indigenous Urea subsidy
: ₹1.04 lakh crore.
Imported Urea subsidy
: ₹31,000 crore.
Indigenous P&K Fertilizer subsidy
: ₹25,500 crore.
Imported P&K Fertilizer subsidy
: ₹18,500 crore.
These subsidies, while necessary for farmers, impose a heavy financial burden on the government.
Strategic Initiatives for Self-Reliance:
Experts recommend increasing India’s production capacity and reducing reliance on imports:
New Urea Plants
: Since the
2012 investment policy
, six new urea plants have been established, adding
76.2 LMT
to India’s production capacity. Currently,
36 urea plants
operate, with recent additions like
Ramgundam, Gorakhpur, Sindri, and Barauni
facilities.
Shift to Sustainable Fertilizers
: Emphasis on
nano urea
natural farming
could reduce chemical fertilizer usage and dependency.
Investment in Domestic Production
: The Standing Committee suggests fostering a favorable environment for investments from public, cooperative, and private sectors in fertilizer manufacturing.
Policy Recommendations and Future Outlook:
The Standing Committee recommends:
Increasing incentives for fertilizer manufacturing within India.
Encouraging use of
and shifting focus to organic and sustainable farming practices.
Investing in infrastructure to better utilize existing fertilizers efficiently.
By expanding production capacities and promoting sustainable agricultural practices, India could gradually reduce its dependency on imported fertilizers, stabilizing the domestic market and insulating it from global disruptions.

**********Navigating India’s Economic Growth Challenges
Why in News?
The Finance Ministry’s latest monthly economic review points to evidence of a slowdown in urban demand as reflected in the performance of various indicators during the first half of FY25.
It summarises key factors contributing to the shifting economic landscape in India, highlighting challenges and potential growth avenues.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Performance of the Indian Economy
Policy Responses and Future Outlook of the Indian Economy
Conclusion
Performance of the Indian Economy:
Overview:
India’s economic growth faces a
, with r
ural resilience offering partial balance
While rural areas show increasing consumption,
urban centres experience demand softness
due to
high food inflation, weakened credit growth, and increased household expenses
Urban demand challenges:
Softening demand in consumer goods:
Major fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies
, such as Tata Consumer Products and Nestle India, signal a decline in urban demand due to high food inflation, especially in metropolitan regions.
Auto companies
also report demand slowdown, exacerbated by seasonal factors like monsoon rains and election-related spending restrictions.
Decline in economic indicators:
GDP:
India's Q1 FY25 GDP growth moderated to 6.7%, with projections for further decline in Q2 due to weakened urban investment and consumption.
Corporate profits:
A review of listed companies' Q2 results shows slowing profit growth, largely due to rising input costs. Crisil noted this as the slowest growth in the last 16 quarters.
Real wages and spending:
Urban wages have also stagnated, with growth in salary outlays falling from 1.2% in Q1 to 0.8% in Q2 FY25, indicating reduced consumer spending capacity.
Inflationary pressures:
Persistent food inflation
has made the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cautious about rate cuts.
RBI Governor emphasises a flexible approach to inflation management, avoiding premature easing of monetary policy.
Rural demand resilience:
FMCG and auto sales:
Rural consumption shows positive momentum, reflected in FMCG volume sales growth and rising tractor and three-wheeler sales.
Nielsen IQ data shows rural FMCG sales rose by 5.2% in Q1 FY25, compared to 4% the previous year.
Agriculture and wage growth:
Real wage growth for agricultural and non-agricultural rural workers supports rising consumption, bolstered by a favourable monsoon season.
Policy Responses and Future Outlook of the Indian Economy:
Government and RBI initiatives:
Government expenditure:
Increased government spending post-election season could stabilise growth, with a strong capital expenditure plan expected from September to March.
Central government expenditure in the first five months of FY25 reached Rs 16.52 lakh crore, down 1.2% from the previous year, indicating room for expansion.
RBI’s monetary stance:
The RBI remains flexible, cautiously monitoring inflation before adjusting rates. RBI continues to support growth by balancing inflation concerns with strategic policy measures.
Festive demand and external stimuli:
Festive season:
With upcoming festivals, consumer discounts and demand are anticipated to lift sales. This boost may partially offset the urban slowdown.
Global influences:
Potential monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve may encourage capital inflows to India, supporting investment and growth in the coming quarters.
Conclusion:
India’s economic outlook is mixed

**********Centre to begin census from 2025
Why in news?
The Centre is reportedly preparing to conduct the Census, which was delayed in 2021 due to Covid-19. Although official confirmation is pending,
the Census is expected to begin next year
This exercise is crucial as it ties into
two major issues
:
delimitation of Parliamentary constituencies, stalled for five decades, and the implementation of women’s reservation in Parliament
India's Census, which has followed a decadal schedule since 1881, missed its 2021 mark for the first time. While the pandemic was largely over by 2022, allowing a Census in 2023 or 2024, the government appears to have postponed it to align with planned constituency reorganisation.
What’s in today’s article?
Census in India
Census and delimitation
Demand for Caste Data in Upcoming Census
About
Population Census provides basic statistics on state of human resources, demography, culture and economic structure at local, regional and national level.
Beginning in the year 1872, when the first census was conducted non-synchronously, the census enumeration exercise in India is carried out in every 10 years.
The first synchronous census was taken under British rule in 1881, by W.C. Plowden, Census Commissioner of India.
The responsibility of conducting the decadal census rests with the Office of the
Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India
, Ministry of Home Affairs.
Legal/Constitutional basis of Census
Population census is listed in
Union List (entry 69)
of Seventh Schedule in Indian Constitution.
Census is conducted under the provisions of the
Census Act, 1948
Process of census enumeration
The Census Operations in India have been carried out in two phases:
Houselisting and Housing Census and
Population Enumeration.
The Population Enumeration follows the Housing Census within a gap of six to eight months.
In Population Enumeration phase each person is enumerated and her/his individual particulars like Age, Marital status, Religion, mother tongue etc.
Delimitation and Its Suspension
Delimitation, mandated by the Constitution, adjusts the number of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies based on population, ensuring equal representation.
It ensures a fair division of geographical areas so that all political parties or candidates contesting elections have a level playing field in terms of a number of voters.
Article 82 and Article 170
of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to readjust the allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies of States respectively, after every census.
However, this process has been suspended since 1976 due to political disagreements.
Following a 2001 Census, the 2002 delimitation exercise only redrew constituency boundaries without changing their number.
Southern states oppose delimitation, fearing that changes would reduce their representation despite their success in population control.
As of the
84th Constitutional Amendment (2001)
delimitation is postponed until at least 2026, thus making 2031 the earliest opportunity for it if based on the Census
Immediate delimitation might not be possible
The 84th Constitutional Amendment restricts delimitation based on Census data from the first Census "taken after the year 2026."
Thus, even if the Census begins in 2025 and completes in 2026, immediate delimitation might not be possible unless the amendment is revised.
An amendment to the existing provision may be required if delimitation is to proceed in time for the 2029 Lok Sabha elections.
Challenges of Political Consensus and Southern States’ Concerns
The suspension of delimitation since 1976 stems from political disagreements, especially with Southern states.
These states argue that accounting for current population figures would unfairly reduce their Parliamentary representation, penalizing them for successful population control.
Their support for delimitation may hinge on receiving compensations or other reassurances.
Additionally,
the 128th Constitutional Amendment
, passed to reserve 33% of seats in Parliament and State Assemblies for women,
requires a delimitation exercise before implementation, further tying delimitation to upcoming political reforms
Role of the 16th Finance Commission
The 16th Finance Commission, due to submit its report next year, will address the distribution of financial resources between the Centre and states, which could impact state-level negotiations regarding delimitation.
The demand
There is a growing expectation that the next Census may include caste data, addressing demands from some political parties for a caste census.
Caste census means inclusion of caste-wise tabulation of India's population in the Census exercise.
Background
Caste was enumerated in British India Censuses (1881-1931).
Post-Independence,
the 1951 Census excluded caste enumeration except for SCs and STs, who continue to be counted
Caste data were collected for the 2011 census but the data was never made public.
In 1961, the GOI recommended states conduct their own surveys for state-specific OBC lists, as there were no central reservations for OBCs at that time.
Though Census is a Union subject,
the Collection of Statistics Act, 2008
allows
States and local bodies to gather necessary data, as seen in Karnataka (2015) and Bihar (2023)

**********Solar, a game changer in women’s empowerment 
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Women Empowerment; Impact of solar energy production on society;
Why in the News?
Rooftop solar (RTS) can transform India’s energy landscape by providing a sustainable, decentralized, and affordable solution for rising electricity needs and could empower consumers (women and other sections of society) toward greater self-reliance.
How does solar energy contribute to women’s economic empowerment?
Income Generation and Financial Independence
: Solar technology enables women to generate income directly, especially in rural areas where traditional energy sources are scarce or costly.
For instance, solar-powered pumps have empowered women salt farmers in Gujarat’s Little Rann of Kutch, who, after shifting from diesel to solar, saw a 94% income boost and lower CO₂ emissions.
Employment Opportunities
: The solar photovoltaic (PV) industry, employing around 4.9 million people in 2022, has been particularly impactful for women, who make up about 40% of its workforce.
Empowerment Programs
: Initiatives like Barefoot College in India and Solar Sister in Africa train women as solar engineers. These programs enhance skills, improve self-reliance, and create employment in remote communities.
What are the broader social implications of women’s involvement in the solar sector?
Community Well-being and Social Development
: Women’s participation in the solar sector promotes local economic growth and strengthens social structures.
Leadership and Decision-Making
: When women lead or actively participate in renewable energy projects, they often advocate for inclusive policies and better community engagement.
Gender-Sensitive Energy Policies
: Women’s involvement highlights the need for energy policies that address the unique needs of women, improving both economic participation and social inclusion.
What challenges do women face in the renewable energy sector, and how can these be addressed?
Access to Training and Financing
: Women often face limited access to training and funding.
Overcoming these barriers requires accessible, affordable training programs in solar technology, as well as microfinance schemes specifically for women-led renewable energy projects.
Gender Bias and Occupational Segregation
: The renewable energy sector, like many others, is affected by gender biases that can limit women’s roles to lower-level positions.
To address this, it’s important to promote women’s leadership and equal opportunities through gender-sensitive hiring practices and mentorship programs.
Policy and Regulatory Gaps
: Energy access policies frequently lack a gender perspective, which limits their reach and inclusiveness.
Integrating gender-focused policies in energy and rural development sectors can enhance the socio-economic impacts of solar energy for women.
Conclusion:
Governments should integrate gender-focused policies within renewable energy frameworks, ensuring accessible financing options and training programs specifically for women. Microfinance schemes and subsidies for women-led solar projects can foster broader participation.
Mains PYQ:
Describe the benefits of deriving electric energy from sunlight in contrast to conventional energy generation. What are the initiatives offered by our government for this purpose?

**********What challenges does India face in fertilizer imports?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India’s Imports and Exports; Impact of global crises on fertilizer;
Why in the News?
As the
crises in
Ukraine and Gaza
persist, experts and policymakers are increasingly concerned about further rises in the costs of components essential for producing
petroleum-based chemical fertilizers
.
Current Scenario of Fertilizer Imports:
India’s domestic fertilizer production capacity does not meet the full demand, requiring substantial imports to bridge the gap.
Urea
: Approximately
20%
of India’s urea requirement is met through imports.
Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)
: Around
50-60%
demand is fulfilled by imports.
Muriate of Potassium (MOP or Potash)
100% of India’s MOP
demand is met through imports, as there is no domestic production.
The Standing Committee on Chemicals and Fertilizers (August 2023) expressed concern about
India’s dependence on imports
for fertilizers, recommending an increase in domestic production capacity.
How did the conflict in Ukraine impact the Global Fertilizer Market?
Market Instability
: Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza are disrupting the stability of the global fertilizer market, particularly affecting the prices of oil and petroleum-based fertilizers.
Supply Chain Disruptions
: These conflicts affect global supply chains, particularly for fertilizer-producing countries such as Russia, which has been a significant source of fertilizer imports for India.
Price Volatility
: Higher oil prices due to geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Gaza indirectly drive up costs of fertilizers, as these are often by-products of petroleum.
Its effects on India
Rising Import Costs
: Increased global fertilizer prices lead to higher import costs for India, putting pressure on the fertilizer subsidy budget.
Potential Supply Constraints
: India’s reliance on imports from conflict-affected regions like Russia and West Asia (including the Middle East) poses risks of reduced fertilizer availability.
Budget Strain
: India’s fertilizer subsidy allocation for 2023-24 was ₹1.79 lakh crore, with substantial amounts dedicated to both indigenous and imported fertilizers.
Need for Self-Reliance
: The conflicts underscore the importance for India to reduce dependency on imports by increasing domestic production capacity, promoting alternatives like nano urea, and exploring sustainable practices like natural farming.
Steps taken by the government:
New Investment Policy (NIP)
: NIP supports new urea manufacturing units by PSUs and private companies, boosting production capacity from 207.54 LMTPA in 2014-15 to 283.74 LMTPA.
Nutrient-Based Subsidy (NBS)
: The government included Potash from Molasses under NBS in 2021, encouraging local production and reducing import dependency.
Public-Private Joint Ventures
: PSUs and private firms collaborate in urea production, establishing units like the Ramagundam Fertilizers in Telangana and Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan plants in northern states.
Way forward:
Boost Domestic Production
: Increase India’s fertilizer production capacity through investment in domestic infrastructure and support for nano urea and alternative sustainable fertilizers to reduce import dependency.
Adopt Policy Reforms
: Implement policies promoting self-reliance in fertilizers, with targeted subsidies and incentives for private, public, and cooperative sectors to enhance production and ensure affordable supply amidst global market volatility.

International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
United Nations; Role of UN peacekeeper;
Why in the News?
During mid-October, 34 UNIFIL troop-contributing Nations condemned attacks on peacekeepers and urged respect for
UNIFIL’s mission
. Although not listed, India expressed full alignment with the joint statement.
About UNIFIL:
UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon)
is a peacekeeping mission established in 1978, focused on monitoring the cessation of hostilities, supporting Lebanese stability, and ensuring security along the Lebanon-Israel Blue Line.
What prompted the condemnation from India and Spain regarding the attacks on UN peacekeepers?
Repeated Targeting of Peacekeepers
: Peacekeepers, including Indian personnel, faced direct attacks, such as IDF tank fire on UNIFIL positions and deliberate disabling of surveillance systems. Spain, along with other European countries, condemned these attacks as “unjustifiable.”
Violation of International Norms
: These attacks on UN peacekeeping personnel and facilities violated the UN mandate, undermining the peacekeepers’ protection under international humanitarian law. Both India and Spain view this as a significant breach of norms that safeguard the sanctity of UN missions.
Response to Escalating Risk to Peacekeepers
: Statements from both India and Spain emphasized the need for respecting UN premises’ “inviolability” and maintaining safety for peacekeepers amidst escalations, underscoring the importance of ensuring the protection and security of peacekeepers.
What is the significance of UNIFIL’s role in Lebanon, and how do India and Spain view it?
Peacekeeping and Stability
: UNIFIL is crucial in mediating and maintaining peace along the Blue Line between Israel and Lebanon. Its presence serves as a stabilizing force, helping prevent spillovers of conflict, which is essential for regional peace.
India’s Role as a Major Contributor
: With 903 personnel deployed, India plays a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts, reflecting its commitment to UN missions and highlighting the need for global respect toward UN mandates.
Spain’s Support for UNIFIL’s Mission
: Spain aligns with other European countries in reinforcing UNIFIL’s role in regional stability. By condemning attacks, Spain emphasizes the importance of this mission in Lebanon and, by extension, its support for UN peacekeeping mandates globally.
How do these events relate to broader geopolitical tensions in the region?
Regional Escalations and Proxy Conflicts
: The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, particularly in Lebanon, feeds into broader geopolitical dynamics involving Israeli security concerns, Lebanese stability, and Iran’s influence through Hezbollah.
Impact on Global Diplomacy
: The hostilities and targeting of UN peacekeepers may strain diplomatic relations, as countries urge Israel to respect international norms and safeguard peacekeepers. This may influence the UN Security Council’s approach, emphasizing a unified international stance against actions threatening UN missions.
Pressure on Multinational Cooperation and Regional Security
: The events underscore the risks of operating in volatile zones where multinational peacekeeping efforts face direct threats.
Way forward:
Strengthen Diplomatic Engagement
: India should actively engage with the UN Security Council and regional stakeholders to advocate for stringent measures ensuring the protection of UN peacekeepers and upholding the sanctity of UN mandates in conflict zones.
Enhance Contingency Protocols for Peacekeepers
: India should work with UNIFIL and other troop-contributing countries to strengthen on-ground security protocols and response mechanisms.
