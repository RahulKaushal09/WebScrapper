What’s in today’s article?
Background
Why Deciphering the Indus Script is Important?
Key Findings from Recent Studies
The Dravidian Hypothesis
Challenges in Deciphering the Script
Recent Initiatives and Global Collaboration
Future Directions
Indus Valley Civilization (IVC)
, also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished between
3000-1500 BCE
, spanning parts of present-day
India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan
Despite its significance as one of the world's earliest urban cultures, the Indus script remains undeciphered, limiting our understanding of its social, political, and cultural dynamics.
Recently,
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin
announced a
$1 million prize
for deciphering the Indus script, underscoring its importance and the potential Dravidian connections to the ancient civilization.
Understanding Harappan Culture
The inability to decipher the script hinders scholars from providing a comprehensive picture of Harappan society, governance, and daily life.
Unlike Egyptian hieroglyphs or Mesopotamian cuneiform, which have been decoded, the Indus script remains a "mystery script."
Cultural and Linguistic Connections
Scholars like Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola have linked the Indus script to
proto-Dravidian languages
, suggesting cultural continuity between the IVC and South India.
The survival of
Brahui
, a Dravidian language in the Indus region, and Dravidian loanwords in the
Rigveda
point to linguistic connections.
Potential Historical Insights
Decoding the script could provide insights into trade networks, religious practices, and societal hierarchies of the IVC.
It may reveal connections with other contemporary civilizations like Mesopotamia and Egypt.
Morphological Study in Tamil Nadu
A study by the
Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA)
found that
90% of graffiti marks
on pottery excavated in Tamil Nadu have parallels with the Indus script.
These marks were categorized into
42 base signs
544 variants
1,521 composite forms
, showcasing their potential evolution from the Indus signs.
Cultural Exchange Hypothesis
Similarities in graffiti marks suggest possible cultural exchanges between the Indus Valley and South India during the Copper and Iron Ages.
The presence of
carnelian, agate beads, and high-tin bronze objects
in South Indian Iron Age graves points to trade links.
Graffiti vs. Script
The study differentiates between
(on pottery) and
(on seals and objects) but notes their common origins and undeciphered status.
Dravidian hypothesis
argues that the Indus script represents an early form of Dravidian language. This view is supported by:
The structural similarities of the Indus script to Dravidian linguistic patterns, such as suffix-based grammar.
The influence of Dravidian substratum on
Prakrit dialects
Indo-Aryan languages
However, scholars caution that while substantial linguistic evidence supports this theory, more research is needed to achieve a universally accepted interpretation.
Lack of Bilingual Texts
Unlike the Rosetta Stone for Egyptian hieroglyphs, no bilingual inscriptions have been found to aid the decoding of the Indus script.
Limited Data
The brevity of Indus inscriptions, with an average length of
4-5 symbols
, makes pattern recognition difficult.
Absence of a Contextual Framework
Without understanding the cultural or linguistic context, linking the symbols to their meanings remains speculative.
International Conferences
Events like the centenary celebration of the IVC's discovery in Tamil Nadu aim to foster collaboration among global experts in archaeology, linguistics, and computational analysis.
Technological Approaches
Advanced techniques like
AI-driven pattern recognition
computational linguistics
are being explored to analyse the structure of the Indus script.
Historical Comparisons
Comparative studies with other undeciphered scripts, like the Rongorongo of Easter Island, provide methodological insights.
Expanding Excavations
Further archaeological excavations in both Indus Valley sites and South India are crucial for unearthing more inscriptions and artifacts.
Scientific Analysis
Radiocarbon dating, material analysis, and
genetic studies
of artifacts can provide a deeper understanding of cultural exchanges.
Multidisciplinary Research
Collaboration between historians, archaeologists, linguists, and data scientists is essential to develop robust methodologies for decipherment.
Q1. When was the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) established?
The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), under the Ministry of Culture, was established in the year 1861 by Alexandar Cunningham.
Q2. What is the role of UNESCO?
UNESCO's mission is to contribute to the building of a culture of peace, the eradication of poverty, sustainable development and intercultural dialogue through education, the sciences, culture, communication and information.

anti-Bolshevik forces
(White Guards) during the civil war.
emerged victorious, consolidating power and paving the way for a unified state.
Formation of the USSR (30
December 1922):
was officially declared, becoming the  world’s first
communist state
Lenin’s leadership
introduced
centralized economic planning
and communist governance.
Soviet leadership evolved from
Bolshevik consolidation to
Stalin's
centralization, the Great Purge of 1936, and Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany, followed by
Khrushchev's
reforms,
Brezhnev's
stability, and
Gorbachev's
restructuring efforts.
World War II and Lithuania- 1940s:
Baltic states
(Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in
) following the
Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact
These
Baltic states had
gained independence in 1918, after the collapse of the Russian Empire
Post-war, the USSR emerged as a
superpower (Warsaw Pact)
, leading the
socialist bloc
and dominating
Cold War
geopolitics
How did Various Challenges Lead to the Dissolution of the USSR?
Economic Stagnation:
By the 1970s, the
Soviet economy
lagged in productivity and technology, with overemphasis on military and satellite states draining resources.
Citizens faced
consumer shortages
and rising dissatisfaction, despite state subsidies ensuring a minimum standard of living .
Gorbachev’s Reforms:
Policies of Gorbachev like
glasnost
(openness) and
perestroika
(restructuring) aimed at reform but inadvertently weakened the Communist Party’s authority.
Multi-party elections in 1990 and reduced censorship fueled
nationalist movements
in republics like
Lithuania and Ukraine
Collapse due to Cold War Pressures:
The costly
arms race
with the US, the defeat in
Afghanistan
, and the
Berlin Wall’s fall in 1989
undermined Soviet control.
The USSR’s failure to compete with Western economic models magnified internal inefficiencies .
Nationalist Movements and Secession:
Under leaders like
Yeltsin
, Russian nationalism weakened central control, while the
Baltic states and Ukraine
sought independence.
By December 1991, the
USSR dissolved
independent states
, marking the end of a
bipolar global order

How Did the Soviet Union's Collapse Reshape Global Power Dynamics?
Emergence of Unipolar World Order:
The USSR’s collapse ended the
, leaving the
as the sole superpower, reshaping global alliances.
NATO
expanded eastward, integrating former Soviet bloc countries like Poland and the Baltic states, reducing Russian influence .
Capitalism Gained Global Dominance:
Western institutions like the
IMF
World Bank
directed economic transitions in former socialist states, promoting
liberal democracy
free-market capitalism
Eastern Europe’s integration into the
European Union
reinforced US-led global hegemony .
Regional Power Shifts Strengthened Multipolarity:
The collapse allowed
China
India
to assert themselves in global geopolitics.
Central Asian republics emerged as strategic players, balancing ties with Russia, China, and the West.
How Does the Legacy of the Soviet Union's Collapse Influence Contemporary Conflicts?
Nationalism And Unresolved Disputes:
The disintegration left
territorial disputes
unresolved, including Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, fueling secessionist movements.
Russia’s 2014
annexation of Crimea
and the ongoing war in Ukraine reflect its effort to reclaim Soviet-era influence .
Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict:
Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict
Nagorno-Karabakh
stems from Stalin's 1923 decision to transfer the region to Azerbaijan, despite its majority Armenian population.
This decision sowed the seeds of ethnic tensions, which escalated into conflict after the Soviet collapse, as Armenia and Azerbaijan competed for control
Kosovo-Serbia Dispute:
declared independence from
in 2008, but Serbia and several countries still refuse to recognize it.
Ethnic tensions
persist, particularly in
Serb-majority regions
like Northern Kosovo, contributing to ongoing instability and complicating the
Balkan peace process
NATO Expansion Escalates Tensions:
NATO’s eastward growth is perceived by Russia as a direct threat, exacerbating its security concerns.
Also, this led to conflicts like that in
, and its legacy continues to fuel geopolitical tensions and instability in
Eastern Europe and beyond.
Russia-Ukraine war
symbolizes broader contestation between Western powers and Russian ambitions .
Energy Resources And Geopolitics Intertwine:
In absence of communist ideology and the USSR, Russia leverages its
oil
gas
defense equipment
to exert influence, especially over
How did the Soviet Union’s Collapse Affect India?
Economic Diversification And Liberalization:
The collapse disrupted India’s trade with the USSR, necessitating economic
liberalization in 1991
to attract foreign investment.
India diversified its partnerships through the
Look East policy (now Act East Policy)
to strengthen ties with
ASEAN
countries and the recent
Act West policy
to enhance trade and strategic relations with
Western nations
Defence Ties Adapted To New Realities:
India transitioned from being a mere importer of
Russian military hardware
to bridging the gap through joint production agreements, such as the
BrahMos missile
, to meet mutual defense needs.
India also expanded
defense cooperation
with the US, France, and Israel to reduce reliance on any single source.
Geopolitical Realignment For Strategic Autonomy:
India balanced relations with
Russia and the US
, maintaining strong ties with Moscow while engaging in US-led initiatives like the
Quad
India also joined other organizations like
BRICS
SCO
to strengthen its strategic autonomy, enhance multilateral partnerships, and promote a more balanced global order.
Access to Central Asian resources, especially through initiatives like the
International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)
, remained a priority .
Cultural And Scientific Collaborations:
Soviet-era cultural exchanges left a lasting legacy, with Indian films and literature enjoying enduring popularity in former Soviet states.
Collaboration in
space technology
nuclear energy
continued, enhancing bilateral relations .
