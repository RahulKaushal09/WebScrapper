WOMEN’S DAY 2025
Syllabus:
Prelims  & Mains – HISTORY
Context:
International Women’s Day (IWD) is celebrated globally on March 8 each year to recognize women’s achievements, promote gender equality, and advocate for women’s rights.
Background: –
The occasion offers an opportunity to recall the struggle of female revolutionaries for the cause of women’s education in India.
Pre Independence Women Activists
In the pre-independent times, several female revolutionaries struggled hard for the cause of women’s education, including Savitribai Phule, Fatima Sheikh, Pandita Ramabai, Chandraprabha Saikiani, Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, Sarala Ray, Anasuya Sarabhai, and Abala Bose.
Savitribai Phule was a Dalit woman who challenged the upper caste hegemony of education.
She opened India’s first school for girls in Vishrambag Wada, Pune, Maharashtra in 1848 along with her husband Jyotirao Phule. Her school was open to all castes.
Savitribai Phule not only promoted education for girls but also stood in opposition to existing social evils like untouchability and prohibition on widow remarriage.
Fatima Sheikh and Pandita Ramabai
Another notable figure, Fatima Sheikh, widely celebrated as India’s first Muslim woman educator, was an associate of Jyotirao and Savitribai Phule in Pune. Unfortunately, not a lot is known about her.
Pandita Ramabai, from Mangalore (then Madras presidency but now part of Karnataka), challenged the caste system by marrying a man from the lower caste.
She was also a staunch advocate for women’s education and actively spoke out against the plight of widows, especially child widows, and child marriage.
Ramabai founded the Arya Mahila Samaj in 1882 to promote women’s education, which was seen as instrumental in eradicating child marriage.
Chandraprabha Saikiani was a social reformer and active proponent of women’s education from Assam.
Saikiani demonstrated her commitment to the cause by starting a school for girls at the young age of 13, where she imparted whatever knowledge she had to other girls.
Her activism extended beyond education. At a large public gathering, she called for a ban on opium – an unusual act for a woman in that era when women speaking in public gatherings was unconventional.
In 1926, Saikiani founded the Assam Pradeshik Mahila Samiti and dedicatedly worked for women’s education.
Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain and Sarala Ray
Begum Rokeya, born in Pairaband, Rangpur, Bengal (part of Bangladesh now), advocated for Muslim women’s education through her visionary women-centric writings.
Her most famous short story, Sultana’s Dream, imagines a gender-reversed society where women run the world and men are confined indoors. Having never been allowed to earn a formal education, she started schools for Muslim girls in Bhagalpur (1909) and Kolkata (1911).
Sarala Ray, an educator from Bengal, founded the Gokhale Memorial Girls’ School in 1920 in Kolkata, where all girls were encouraged to learn three languages – Hindi, Bengali and English – as part of the school’s innovative curriculum.
Later, she extended her efforts towards women’s higher education and established the Gokhale Memorial Girls’ College in 1938.

CONVENTION ON CLUSTER MUNITIONS
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Lithuania quit an international convention banning cluster bombs, citing security concerns over neighbouring Russia in a move that has drawn criticism from human rights groups.
NATO member Lithuania has said it wants to strengthen its defences following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fearing it could be next if Moscow succeeds.
The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) is an international treaty that prohibits the use, production, transfer, and stockpiling of cluster bombs, which pose severe risks to civilians.
Key Features of the Convention
Adoption: 30 May 2008 in Dublin, Ireland.
Entry into Force: 1 August 2010 (after 30 countries ratified it).
Signatories: 123 countries (as of 2023), but major powers like the USA, Russia, China, and India have not signed.
Main Provisions:
Total Ban on cluster munitions.
Stockpile Destruction within 8 years.
Clearance of Affected Areas within 10 years.
Assistance to Victims (healthcare, rehabilitation, and reintegration).
Why Cluster Munitions are Controversial?
Wide Area Effect: Cluster bombs release multiple submunitions over large areas, causing indiscriminate damage.
Failure Rate: Unexploded bomblets become de facto landmines, harming civilians for decades.
Humanitarian Crisis: Countries like Laos, Vietnam, Syria, and Ukraine suffer from past cluster munition use.
India’s Stand on CCM
Not a Signatory: India has not signed or ratified the CCM.
Reasons for Non-Signature:
Believes in the legitimate defense use of cluster munitions.
Calls for a balance between security and humanitarian concerns.
Reluctant to accept legally binding disarmament treaties without universal participation (as major powers like the USA and Russia are not part of it).

BANGUS VALLEY
Mains – GEOGRAPHY
The Jammu and Kashmir government announced a new set of rules for Bangus, a far-off tourist spot near the Line of Control (LoC) in north Kashmir, in a bid to promote it as an ecotourism destination.
The decision comes in the wake of unplanned and uncontrolled growth in concrete structures in the traditional tourist hotspots of Pahalgam, Gulmarg and Sonamarg in Kashmir.
Bangus Valley, also known as Bungus Valley, is a pristine and lesser-known destination located in the Kupwara district of Jammu and Kashmir, India.
The name “Bangus” is derived from the Sanskrit words “Van” (forest) and “Gus” (grass), reflecting the valley’s lush grassy landscapes.
Situated approximately 100 kilometers northwest of Srinagar, the valley rests at an elevation of about 10,000 feet above sea level within the Pir Panjal mountain range.
The valley is divided into two main sections:
Bodh Bangus (Big Bangus): The main valley, locally known as Bodh Bangus, covers an estimated area of about 300 square kilometers. It consists of a linear elliptical bowl aligned along the east-west axis.
Lokut Bangus (Small Bangus): A smaller valley known as Lokut Bangus lies on the northeastern side of the main valley.
Both valleys feature level green meadows surrounded by low-lying mountains covered with dense coniferous forests.
The valley is encircled by the Rajwar and Mawar regions to the east, the Shamasbury and Dajlungun Mountains to the west, and the Chowkibal and Karnah Guli areas to the north.

LOSS AND DAMAGE FUND
In a setback to global climate justice efforts, the United States has withdrawn from loss and damage fund aimed at compensating developing countries for the damages caused by climate change.
As the largest historical emitter, the United States bears a significant share of the blame for the climate adversities affecting vulnerable populations worldwide.
The Loss and Damage Fund is a critical financial mechanism established to address the adverse impacts of climate change, particularly in vulnerable and developing countries.
The concept of “Loss and Damage” was first introduced in the 1991 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations by island nations fearing existential threats due to climate change.
It gained prominence under the Paris Agreement (2015), which recognized the need to address loss and damage separately from mitigation and adaptation.
It was formally established at the COP27 (27th Conference of the Parties) held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in November 2022.
At COP28, the decision to operationalize the LDF was adopted by consensus, with several countries pledging significant amounts to the fund. For example, the United Arab Emirates committed USD 100 million, the United Kingdom committed GBP 40 million, and the European Union committed 225 million euros.
Scope: The fund addresses both extreme weather events (e.g., hurricanes, floods) and slow-onset events (e.g., sea-level rise, desertification).
Governance: The LDF is overseen by a Governing Board that determines how the fund’s resources are disbursed. The World Bank serves as the interim trustee, hosting the fund for four years.
Funding: The fund encourages voluntary contributions from developed countries but also invites developing countries to contribute. Financial support is provided in the form of grants and concessional financing

**********What is Insider Trading?
Nestle India recently said it received a warning from the country’s markets regulator for a breach of insider trading regulations “by a designated person of the company”.
About Insider Trading:
Insider trading, also known as
insider dealing
, is the malpractice of
selling or buying a company's securities by the insiders of a company.
●
Who is an insider?
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) defines an ‘insider’ as
someone who has access to price-sensitive information
about a particular
company's shares or securities.
An insider can be anyone who has been
associated with the company
in some way
during the six months preceding the insider trade.
That person could be an
employee, a director, relative, banker or a legal counsel
to the company, or even
an official of the stock exchanges,
trustees or employees of an asset management company (AMC) that worked with the company.
Insiders, who have access to confidential and exclusive information about the issuer of a particular security or stock,
benefit from buying or selling undisclosed securities before they fluctuate in price.
What is Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI)?
UPSI refers to a piece of
exclusive information related to a firm’s
stock prices, quarterly results, acquisition deals, mergers, or any kind of sensitive activities that have
not been shared with the public at large.
When insiders are able to access the UPSI, they illegally conduct trade dealings for personal gains.
Insider trading is one of the most serious malpractices that exists in the market.
In India, insider trades are
regulated by the SEBI under the Insider Trading Regulations, 2015.
To prevent such acts of insider trading and to promote fair trading in the market for the interest of common investors,
SEBI has prohibited the firms from purchasing their own shares from the secondary market.
SEBI can
impose fines and prohibit individuals or entities from trading
in the capital market
if found in violation of rules.
For example, a company director informs his friend about a yet-to-be-declared deal, and the latter disseminates that information to his colleagues, who then buy that company’s stocks.
Then, the manager, his friend, and his colleagues are liable to be booked by SEBI for violation of PTI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations.

**********World's Oldest Impact Crater
Scientists in Australia have discovered the world's oldest known meteorite impact crater in northwestern Australia, estimated to be 3.47 billion years old.
About World's Oldest Impact Crater:
Scientists in Australia have identified what they believe to be the world's oldest known meteorite impact crater, a finding that could reshape understanding of Earth's history and the origins of life.
The crater, discovered in the remote
North Pole dome region in northwestern Australia
, is estimated to be 3.47 billion years old—more than a billion years older than any previously known impact site.
The crater, named the
North Pole Crater
, was likely formed by a meteorite striking Earth at more than 36,000 kilometres per hour, creating an impact site over 100 kilometres wide. The collision may have sent debris flying across the planet, with molten droplets possibly landing as far away as South Africa.
This discovery challenges previous assumptions about Earth's ancient history and suggests that such impacts may have contributed to the origins of life by creating environments suitable for microbial activity.
What is an Impact Crater?
An impact crater forms
when a fast-moving asteroid or meteorite crashes into a planet or moon
The impact is so powerful that it vaporizes the object, creating shockwaves that melt and reshape the ground, leaving a large circular hole with scattered rocks.
Examples:
Barringer Crater, Tycho Crater, etc.

**********Woolly Mice
Scientists have successfully edited mouse DNA with genes from the woolly mammoth, creating the world’s first furry “woolly mice.” This breakthrough provides insights into how ancient species adapted to extreme cold.
About Woolly Mice:
The woolly mice have been genetically engineered
by modifying seven genes
that code for traits like hair length, thickness, and colour. These modifications include genes such as
FGF5 for longer hair
MC1R for a golden coat
Purpose:
The creation of woolly mice serves as a proof-of-concept for the feasibility of gene editing in de-extinction efforts. It demonstrates the ability to recreate complex genetic combinations that took nature millions of years to develop
How did the scientists create woolly mice?
Identifying Mammoth Genes:
Scientists first compared mammoth DNA with their closest living relative, the Asian elephant, to identify genetic differences related to hair length, thickness, texture, colour, and body fat.
Selecting Relevant Traits:
They selected 10 mammoth gene variants linked to these traits and matched them with similar known genetic variants in laboratory mice for targeted gene editing.
Gene Editing in Mice:
Using
CRISPR technology
, scientists made eight precise edits to modify seven genes in the mice, incorporating mammoth-like traits responsible for a woolly coat and cold adaptation.
Result:
The genetically modified mice were born with thicker, longer fur, confirming that the selected mammoth genes influenced hair growth and cold resistance, as predicted by computational analysis.

**********Donald Trump establishes US Bitcoin reserve
Why in news?
Former U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a
Strategic
Reserve
and a
US Digital Asset Stockpile
The Bitcoin reserve will be funded with BTC forfeited in criminal or civil asset seizures, providing the U.S. with a strategic advantage. Other agencies will assess their ability to contribute seized Bitcoin. Similarly, the
will include other forfeited digital assets.
Despite the move, Bitcoin's price dropped over 4% at the time.
What’s in today’s article?
Working of Bitcoin Reserve
Other Digital Assets in the Stockpile
Boost to Crypto Market
The White House fact sheet highlights that no clear policy exists for managing seized digital assets, leading to accountability issues and missed opportunities for centralization and security.
Government Bitcoin Holdings & Audit
It is estimated that the U.S. government owns around 200,000 BTC, but a full audit has never been conducted.
The executive order mandates a complete accounting of federal digital asset holdings.
Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset
The U.S. will not sell Bitcoin deposited into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve but will hold it as a store of value.
The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are
tasked with developing budget-neutral strategies to acquire more Bitcoin without imposing costs on taxpayers
Strategic Advantage & Missed Opportunities
With Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, the fact sheet underscores the importance of early adoption for strategic positioning in the global financial system.
Past premature sales of Bitcoin have cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion.
Apart from Bitcoin, the
Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano
, as mentioned by President Trump earlier.
Acquisition Policy
The U.S. government will not actively acquire additional digital assets for the stockpile.
Instead, it will consist only of assets obtained through forfeiture proceedings, similar to the Bitcoin reserve.
Management & Potential Sales
The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to develop strategies for responsible stewardship, which may include selling assets from the stockpile.
All government agencies must report their digital asset holdings to the Secretary of the Treasury and the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.
The cryptocurrency market has surged following Trump’s election victory, driven by expectations that his administration will adopt a pro-crypto stance.
Elon Musk’s Influence
Trump’s potential collaboration with Elon Musk, a known crypto advocate, has further strengthened investor confidence in Bitcoin and other digital assets, despite concerns about conflicts of interest.
Pro-Crypto Leadership at SEC
Trump has chosen Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a figure widely regarded as a crypto-friendly regulator.
The SEC has dropped multiple investigations and lawsuits against cryptocurrency firms over alleged securities violations.

**********Issue of Duplicate Voter ID
Why in news?
The Election Commission (EC) has pledged to resolve the long-standing issue of duplicate voter ID numbers within three months. This follows concerns from Opposition parties over potential voter manipulation.
The EC acknowledged that different individuals could share the same
Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC)
number due to states using identical alphanumeric series but denied this indicated fake voters. Opposition leaders argue that duplicate voter IDs exist within the same state.
According to the EC’s Manual on Electoral Rolls, 2023, all EPICs should have unique numbers.
What’s in today’s article?
Allegation on Electoral Roll Manipulation
Election Commission’s Response on Duplicate EPIC Numbers
The Registration of Electors Rules, 1960 mandates the issuance of Electors Photo Identity Cards (EPICs) to prevent voter impersonation.
State governments began issuing EPICs to registered voters in 1993.
Nature of EPICs
EPICs serve as identity documents but do not grant the right to vote. Only those listed in the electoral roll of a constituency can vote.
An EPIC includes the voter's name, age, residence, specified particulars, a photograph, and the facsimile signature of the registration officer.
Unique EPIC Number System
As per the EC Manual on Electoral Rolls, 2023, each EPIC is assigned a unique alphanumeric number consisting of three alphabetical codes followed by a seven-digit number.
This includes a Functional Unique Serial Number (FUSN) for each Assembly constituency.
Issuance Process
Since 2017, EPICs have been generated through the EC’s ERONET portal and can only be created online.
A unique EPIC number is assigned to a voter when issued for the first time. If a replacement is needed, the original number remains unchanged.
A prominent political party has alleged that many voters have the same EPIC number, raising concerns about the integrity of the electoral roll.
It further alleged that non-residents were being brought into Bengal to vote using duplicated EPIC numbers.
The Election Commission (EC) acknowledged the existence of duplicate EPIC numbers but clarified that this does not indicate fake voters.
Reason for Duplication
Before the introduction of the ERONET platform, different states used the same alphanumeric series for EPICs, leading to duplication.
However, other voter details, such as name, address, constituency, and polling booth, remained unique.
Clarification on Voting Rights
The EC emphasized that an elector can only vote at their designated polling station within their registered constituency, regardless of their EPIC number.
Plan for Rectification
To address concerns, the EC assured that unique EPIC numbers would be assigned to all registered voters.
The ERONET 2.0 platform will be updated to facilitate this process, and new EPIC numbers will be issued to those affected by duplication.

The chairman of the World Spice Organisation (WSO), recently stated that despite being the largest producer and exporter of diverse varieties of spices in the world, India’s share in the global seasoning market is only 0.7%.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Spices in India (Introduction, Current Status, Challenges, Govt Initiatives, etc.)
News Summary
Introduction:
India is the world’s largest producer and exporter of spices, growing a diverse variety due to its 15 different agro-climatic zones.
However, despite this dominance in production, India’s presence in the global seasoning market is surprisingly low.
The country accounts for only
of the $14 billion global seasoning industry, while China and the USA hold
12% and 11%
shares, respectively.
This gap highlights the urgent need to improve value addition, boost exports, and explore new commercial applications for Indian spices.
Current Status of Spice Production in India:
India produces around
1.5 million tonnes
of spices annually, contributing to
$4.5 billion in exports
—about
25% of the $20 billion global spice market
The primary spice-growing regions include Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat.
However, new regions like the
North-East, Odisha, and Jharkhand
are emerging as significant spice producers.
Some of the most widely grown and exported spices in India include:
Black Pepper
– "The King of Spices," mainly grown in Kerala and Karnataka.
Cardamom
– Highly valued in global markets, produced in South India.
Turmeric
– Used in culinary, medicinal, and nutraceutical applications.
Cumin & Coriander
– Essential for Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine.
Chilies
– India is the largest producer of red chilies, widely grown in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
While India leads in raw spice exports, it lags in
value-added products
, such as spice blends, extracts, and nutraceutical formulations.
Currently, only
48%
of exported spices are value-added, with the rest being raw spices.
Challenges Facing India’s Spice Industry:
Low Value-Added Exports
India primarily exports whole spices rather than processed spice products like seasonings, extracts, and nutraceuticals.
To meet the
$10 billion export target by 2030
, the share of value-added spices should
increase from 48% to 70%
High Cost of Production
Farmers struggle with rising costs due to inefficient agricultural practices, pesticide overuse, and outdated processing methods.
Improving productivity and cost-efficiency is crucial for global competitiveness.
Limited Global Market Penetration
While India dominates spice production, countries like
Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and China
have expanded their presence in international spice markets.
Additionally,
African nations
have recently entered spice cultivation, posing new competition.
Quality & Safety Concerns
Stringent global regulations on pesticide residues and contamination require
strict quality control measures
Last year, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Nepal have banned or restricted the sale of MDH spices due to safety concerns.
These countries have banned the sale of some MDH spices due to suspected high levels of ethylene oxide, a pesticide that can cause cancer.
Many Indian spice farmers need training in
integrated pest management, hygiene, and sustainable practices
to meet international standards.
Climate Change Impact
Spice cultivation is highly sensitive to climate conditions. Unpredictable monsoons and rising temperatures threaten
yields and quality
Developing
high-yielding and climate-resistant varieties
is essential to maintaining production levels.
Government & Industry Efforts for Improvement:
Several initiatives are underway to enhance India’s spice production and exports:
Spices Board of India
– Promotes research, processing, and export growth in the sector.
– Works with Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) to improve spice farming techniques.
Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)
– Developing high-yield and climate-resistant spice varieties.
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Programs
– Educates farmers on sustainable cultivation practices.
By focusing on
quality improvement, innovation in value-added products, and expanding into nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications
, India can significantly increase its global market share.
News Summary:
Despite being the
of spices, India holds just
$14 billion global seasoning market
The country exports
$4.5 billion worth of spices annually
, but only
of these are value-added products.
To achieve the
$10 billion spice export target by 2030
, India must:
Increase value addition
– Shift from whole spices to seasonings, spice blends, and medicinal extracts.
Expand global market presence
– Strengthen trade agreements and diversify export destinations.
Improve quality & safety compliance
– Enhance pesticide control and meet international standards.
Boost production efficiency
– Reduce costs through modern farming and processing methods.
If these steps are implemented, India can transform from being the largest
raw spice producer
to a dominant player in
value-added global seasoning markets

**********Tahawwur Hussain Rana Extradition Case: US Supreme Court Rejects Plea Against Extradition to India
Why in News?
The United States Supreme Court has rejected the plea of Tahawwur Hussain Rana,
an accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks
, against his extradition to India.
Rana had filed an "
Emergency Application for Stay
" following former President Donald Trump's approval of his extradition.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background - Rana’s Involvement in 26/11 and Other Cases
Legal Battle Over Extradition
India-US Extradition Treaty (1997)
US Position on Indian Extradition Requests
Conclusion
Background - Rana’s Involvement in 26/11 and Other Cases:
a Pakistani-origin Canadian national
, is accused of aiding and abetting reconnaissance activities for the Mumbai attacks along with David Coleman Headley.
Arrested in Chicago in 2009
for involvement in the Mumbai attacks and a foiled attack on the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.
Convicted in the US
for providing material support to terrorism in Denmark and to the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. Sentenced to 168 months in prison on January 7, 2013.
Released on compassionate grounds
on June 9, 2020, but
immediately faced an extradition request from India.
Legal Battle Over Extradition:
India requested Rana's extradition in December 2019 under the
India-US Extradition Treaty (1997).
Rana opposed
extradition, citing "
double jeopardy
," claiming he was already acquitted of charges related to India.
A US Magistrate Judge rejected his argument
in May 2023, stating that Indian charges had distinct legal elements.
His subsequent petitions
to the US District Court, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and ultimately the US Supreme Court were all
India-US Extradition Treaty (1997):
It facilitates extradition for offences
punishable by more than one year of imprisonment in both countries.
Acts such as
terrorism, hijacking, and crimes against protected persons
are extraditable, however,
Political offences are non-extraditable
However, certain actions such as
The murder or other willful crime against a Head of State/ Government or a member of their family,
Aircraft hijacking and aviation sabotage,
Crimes against internationally protected persons, and
Hostage-taking, etc.,
are not construed as political offences under the treaty.
The US government found "
probable cause
" to believe that Rana committed extraditable offences under the
treaty’s dual-criminality clause
US Position on Indian Extradition Requests:
Only two alleged terrorists
have been extradited from the US to India:
Charanjeet Singh Cheema (2005)
Kulbeer Singh Kulbeera (2006)
The treaty facilitated
11 extraditions
between 2002-2018,
mostly for financial fraud
. 65 Indian extradition requests remain pending with the US.
The US refused to extradite
David Headley
due to his plea bargain and
Warren Anderson
(Union Carbide CEO) due to "insufficient evidence."
Conclusion:
The US Supreme Court's rejection of Rana’s plea paves the way for his extradition to India, where he will face charges related to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.
This case highlights the complexities of international extradition
, diplomatic negotiations, and legal interpretations under the India-US Extradition Treaty.

**********An Equitable Future for Women in Science in India
Context
Women in science face persistent challenges
that hinder their progress, starting from early education and continuing through their professional careers.
Despite increasing awareness
, gender biases, societal expectations,
and institutional barriers continue to limit their opportunities.
It is
important to explore these obstacles, the importance of retaining women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics),
and the necessary interventions to create a more inclusive and equitable scientific community.
Barriers to Women in STEM
Educational and Cultural Hurdles
The
challenges for women in
STEM begin early
, with gendered societal norms discouraging girls from pursuing science-related careers.
Limited access to quality education, biases in pedagogy, and
a lack of role models further dissuade young girls from entering scientific fields.
Even those who persist often face cultural expectations
that prioritise family responsibilities over professional growth, making career advancement difficult.
Workplace Discrimination and Attrition
For women who successfully enter STEM professions,
systemic discrimination remains a significant issue.
Hiring biases, unequal pay
, and limited funding opportunities
restrict their professional growth.
orkplace harassment and exclusionary environments contribute to high attrition rates
, as highlighted by a study across 38 countries.
Women often struggle with work-life balance due to
a lack of institutional support
, such as flexible work policies and affordable childcare.
This
results in fewer women progressing to senior positions,
perpetuating the gender gap.
The Leaky Pipeline and Systemic Inequalities
The underrepresentation of women in senior roles can be understood through the
leaky pipeline metaphor,
which describes
how women drop out of STEM at various career stages
due to biased systems and hostile workplaces.
However
, more recent frameworks, such as the ‘Chutes and Ladders’ model, emphasise broader structural barriers
, including mentorship gaps, career disruptions, and a lack of access to hidden knowledge.
These
factors disproportionately affect women, minorities, and economically disadvantaged individuals,
highlighting the need for systemic change
The Importance of Retaining Women in Science

**********Inclusion in Public Spaces; From Fear to Freedom
Context
India has long grappled with deep-rooted gender inequalities
, and one of the most pressing concerns is the accessibility and safety of public spaces for women.
The country
ranks 128 out of 177 on the Women, Peace, and Security Index 2023
, highlighting the urgent need for systemic change.
While violence against women is often discussed in terms of domestic abuse and workplace harassment, one crucial
yet overlooked aspect is how public spaces are designed, regulated, and experienced by women.
Gendered Spatial Control and Women’s Mobility
Public spaces are not just areas of movement;
they are critical zones where socio-economic and political life unfolds.
However,
these spaces remain largely male-dominated,
reinforcing gendered spatial control that limits women’s mobility.
Studies show
that women’s access to public spaces is often dictated by necessity
rather than choice.
According to the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16),
only 54% of Indian women could visit markets alone,
while 50% could access healthcare facilities independently.
Additionally,
the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for women in 2023-24 stood at 35.6%,
indicating that more than half of India’s female population remains outside the workforce.
For working women,
public spaces are primarily transitional, areas they pass through between home and work.
Unlike men, who can freely loiter, socialise, or relax in public spaces,
women’s presence is often restricted to function-driven activities.
This
limitation is not just a matter of convenience but a form of social exclusion
that reinforces patriarchal norms.
The idea that women must always have a purpose
when outside their homes discourages them from fully engaging in public life.
A Detailed Analysis of the Issue of Safety and Women’s Restricted Access
The Fear of Violence and Its Impact on Women’s Mobility
Public spaces are often considered unsafe for women
due to the high prevalence of gender-based violence, including catcalling, stalking, groping, and more severe forms of assault.
This constant threat creates a culture of fear, leading women to
develop defensive strategies
when navigating public areas.
Many adopt behavioural modifications, such as:
Avoiding isolated areas,
poorly lit streets, and public transportation at late hours.
Choosing specific routes that are deemed safer
, even if they are longer or less convenient.
Walking briskly, avoiding eye contact,
or regulating body language to minimize attention.
Dressing conservatively or modifying their appearance
to avoid unwanted harassment.
These
adaptations highlight how deeply ingrained the fear of violence
is in women’s everyday lives.
Unlike men, who generally move freely in public spaces,
women are conditioned to remain alert, cautious, and hyper-aware of their surroundings.
The Role of Public Spaces in Gendered Violence
commonly associated with private spheres such as homes or workplaces,
public spaces also play a significant role in perpetuating gender-based violence.
Open spaces, such as streets, parks, and bus stations, expose women to threats from multiple strangers
rather than a single perpetrator, increasing their vulnerability.
Moreover, public transportation
, a necessity for many working women and students, is a hotspot for harassment.
Cases of groping, inappropriate touching, and verbal abuse are widespread,
making many women reluctant to use buses, trains, or other forms of shared transit.
The lack of adequate security measures, poorly lit stations, and inadequate seating arrangements further contribute to their insecurity.
Social Perceptions and Victim-Blaming
One of the most significant barriers to addressing gendered
violence in public spaces is the pervasive culture of victim-blaming.
Women who experience harassment or assault are
often questioned about their actions, attire, or location at the time of the incident. Common responses include
Why was she out so late at night?
What was she wearing?
She should have been more careful.
This shift in focus, from the perpetrator’s actions to the victim’s choices, not only discourages women from reporting crimes but
also reinforces restrictive norms that confine them to private spaces.
The burden of safety is placed entirely on women,
absolving men of responsibility and allowing gender-based violence to persist with minimal consequences
The Consequences of Restricted Access
Limited Economic Participation:
Women are less likely to take up jobs that require late-night shifts, travel, or movement through unsafe areas, restricting their career options and financial independence.
Reduced Social Engagement:
Women’s participation in recreational activities, social events, and community gatherings is often limited, leading to social isolation.
Psychological Impact:
Constant vigilance and fear of harassment contribute to stress, anxiety, and a diminished sense of freedom and autonomy.
The Way Forward: A Need for Change at Both Societal and Policy Level
Urban Design Improvements:
Well-lit streets, accessible public toilets, and open recreational areas with visible security measures can create safer environments.
Stronger Legal Frameworks:
Faster legal proceedings, higher conviction rates for offenders, and stricter penalties for crimes against women can serve as deterrents.
Public Awareness Campaigns:
Educating men and society as a whole about gender-based violence, consent, and respect for women in public spaces is essential.
Encouraging Women’s Presence:
Women must be encouraged to reclaim public spaces, engage in leisure activities, and break the cycle of fear and restriction.
Conclusion
While centuries of patriarchal control cannot be dismantled overnight
, meaningful change begins with small but consistent efforts.
fight for women’s right to public spaces is not just about safety
but about equity and autonomy.
Public spaces should be inclusive environments where women can move freely
, without restriction or fear.
By reshaping both the built environment and societal attitudes,
India can work towards a future where women are no longer just passing through public spaces
but actively reclaiming and owning them.

**********[8th March 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: What ails Pre-Clinical PG Courses?
Indian Society
PYQ Relevance:
) Appropriate local community level healthcare intervention is a prerequisite to achieve ‘Health for All’ in India. Explain.
(UPSC CSE 2018)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on the
‘Health for All’ (2018)
and
primary health structure is a necessary precondition
(2021).
No students enrolled in
postgraduate (PG) medical pre-clinical
courses like anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, forensic medicine, microbiology, and pharmacology at Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre (VIMS), Bengaluru, until the second round of PG-NEET counselling.
Today’s editorial discusses the issues related to
postgraduate medical seats. This content would help in GS Paper 2 and 3 in the mains paper.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Many postgraduate medical seats are vacant this year because students are choosing pre-clinical courses.
Why are postgraduate medical students reluctant to choose pre-clinical courses in Karnataka?
Lack of Job Opportunities:
Pre-clinical graduates cannot practice as doctors and are limited to working in laboratories, diagnostic centers, or as faculty.
Example:
Despite reducing tuition fees and offering job guarantees, private institutions like the
struggle to fill pre-clinical seats due to limited employment avenues.
Lower Salary Compared to Clinical Courses:
Pre-clinical roles offer significantly lower remuneration than clinical practice, making them financially unattractive.
A clinical doctor can earn a higher salary working in hospitals or private practice, while pre-clinical graduates face salary stagnation in academic or lab-based roles.
Limited Career Progression and Mobility:
Clinical course graduates have the flexibility to work globally and in various healthcare sectors, while pre-clinical graduates are restricted to teaching or research roles.
An MD in General Medicine can practice as a physician anywhere, whereas an MD in Anatomy primarily qualifies for academic positions.
High Capital Requirement for Self-Employment:
Establishing independent diagnostic centers requires significant investment, which deters pre-clinical graduates from entrepreneurial ventures.
Diagnostic centers with advanced technology demand substantial startup costs, making it challenging for pre-clinical graduates to become self-employed.
Persistent Seat Vacancies Reflect Low Demand:
Consistent under-enrollment over the years signals a long-term disinterest in these courses.
In 2024-25, only 6 out of 104 MD Anatomy seats were filled in Karnataka, despite five rounds of counselling and reduced cut-off percentages.
What is the trend of student enrollment in PG medical courses at the all-India level?
Substantial Increase in PG Medical Seats
: The number of PG medical seats has risen from 31,185 before 2014 to 70,645 by the 2023-24 academic year, marking a 127% increase.
Growth in Medical Colleges
: The total number of medical colleges has expanded by 82%, from 387 before 2014 to 704 in 2023. This expansion has contributed to the increased availability of both undergraduate (UG) and PG medical seats.
Rising Demand for Medical Education
: The number of candidates aspiring to study MBBS grew from 16 lakh in 2019 to 24 lakh in 2024, reflecting a heightened interest in medical education.
Improved UG to PG Seat Ratio
: The ratio of UG to PG medical seats improved from 2.1:1 in 2018-19 to 1.9:1 in 2022-23, indicating better alignment between the number of medical graduates and available PG training opportunities.
Emerging Challenges
: Despite the increase in seats, challenges such as geographic disparities in seat distribution and concerns about the quality of education persist.
For example,
has the highest number of PG medical seats, totaling 5,984, with a significant contribution from private institutions, but States like Arunachal Pradesh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Mizoram, and Nagaland currently do not offer PG medical seats.
What is the significance of pre-clinical courses?
Foundation for Advanced Medical Practice:
Pre-clinical courses (Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry) provide the scientific basis for understanding human biology and disease mechanisms.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of biochemistry in vaccine development and understanding viral behavior.
Essential for Medical Education and Training:
These courses are crucial for training future doctors, ensuring they understand the human body before clinical practice.
Medical schools worldwide adopted virtual anatomy labs during the pandemic, enhancing remote learning and maintaining education continuity.
Innovation in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques:
Pre-clinical research drives advancements in diagnostic tools and medical treatments.
Advances in physiology have contributed to wearable health devices like continuous glucose monitors for diabetic patients.
How has the National Medical Commission (NMC) addressed the issue of unfilled PG medical seats in Karnataka?
Reduction of NEET-PG Cut-off Scores
: In an unprecedented move, the NEET-PG 2023 cut-off was reduced to zero, making all candidates who appeared for the exam eligible for PG medical programs. This decision aimed to expand the pool of eligible candidates and fill vacant seats across various specialties.
Guidelines for Interstate Posting Under District Residency Programme
: The NMC issued directives emphasizing strict adherence to the Post-Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2023.
These guidelines facilitate the interstate posting of PG medical students under the District Residency Programme, ensuring a more even distribution of medical professionals and addressing regional disparities in seat occupancy.
Monitoring and Rectifying Seat Allocation Discrepancies
: The NMC has been proactive in addressing discrepancies between its records and those of state authorities. For instance, admissions to 23 PG medical seats in Bengaluru were put on hold due to mismatches between NMC and Directorate of Medical Education (DME) lists. Such actions ensure that seat allocations are transparent and accurate.
Annual Increase of PG Seats
: The NMC has facilitated the process for medical institutions to apply for an increase in PG seats for the academic year 2025-26. By inviting applications and setting clear guidelines, the commission aims to enhance the availability of PG medical seats, thereby reducing the likelihood of vacancies.
Way forward:

**********Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Researchers have found that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is
slowing due to melting ice sheets
. By
2050, it may weaken by 20%
, affecting
global climate, ocean circulation, and marine ecosystems
What is the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)?
The ACC is the
strongest and largest ocean current
on Earth.
It flows
continuously from west to east
around Antarctica, acting as a
boundary between the Southern Ocean and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans
It flows from
, driven by the westerly winds and the Coriolis effect, creating a loop that completely encircles Antarctica.
The ACC interacts with several regional currents, such as the
Brazil Current
East Australian Current
Agulhas Current
It is influenced by both
polar easterlies
, which affect its strength and flow patterns.
Key features of the ACC:
five times stronger than the Gulf Stream
and transports
130 million cubic meters of water per second
It plays a crucial role in
global heat and nutrient distribution
, influencing climate patterns worldwide.
It prevents
warmer northern waters
from reaching Antarctica, helping to
preserve the region’s ice sheets
drives the global conveyor belt
, regulating
deep ocean currents
and heat flow.
Its upwelling of
nutrient-rich waters
sustains Antarctic marine life, including
krill, whales, and penguins
Why does Antarctic Ice Melt affect ACC?
Freshwater Dilution:
Melting ice lowers salinity, weakening ocean density gradients that drive the ACC.
Slower Heat Exchange:
Reduced current strength disrupts global heat distribution, leading to stronger storms and rising sea levels.
Key Findings of the New Research
A study by the
University of Melbourne and NORCE Norwegian Research Centre
, published in
Environmental Research Letters
, reveals:
ACC could slow by 20% by 2050
due to melting ice sheets.
Disrupted global climate
as a weaker ACC reduces
heat distribution, carbon absorption, and weather stability
Antarctic ecosystem at risk
, with invasive species threatening
penguins, krill, and whales
Supercomputer simulations confirm
that deep ocean circulation is
, worsening climate instability.
Reducing carbon emissions is crucial
to prevent further ice melting and ACC weakening.

Read the attached story
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court has acknowledged a
serious issue regarding the lack of disabled-friendly infrastructure in prisons
, following a petition citing the
trauma and inhumane conditions faced by Professor G. Saibaba and Stan Swamy
A
bench comprising Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta
noted that even the
Persons with Disabilities Act (2016)
lacks a
legal framework
to safeguard the rights of
disabled prisoners
Challenges Faced by Disabled Prisoners:
Inaccessible Infrastructure
: Most prisons lack ramps, handrails, wheelchair-accessible cells, and essential assistive devices.
Denial of Medical Care
: Many disabled prisoners do not receive necessary medical treatment, physiotherapy, or even basic aids like hearing devices or walking supports.
Psychological Distress
: Isolation, lack of facilities, and mistreatment lead to anxiety, depression, and deteriorating mental health among disabled prisoners.
Data Deficiency
: No official records track the number or condition of disabled prisoners, making policy implementation difficult.
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (in Prisons)
Article 14
guarantees equality before the law, ensuring that prisoners are not discriminated against based on disability.
Article 21
upholds the right to life and dignity, including humane treatment for prisoners.
Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
mandates accessible public spaces, medical care, and assistive devices for persons with disabilities, but implementation in prisons remains inadequate.
Model Prison Manual, 2016
recommends disability-friendly infrastructure such as ramps and medical care provisions, yet many states have not adopted these reforms.
Supreme Court Judgments:
Upendra Baxi vs. State of U.P. (1983)
the Supreme Court reaffirmed that prisoners are entitled to humane treatment.
Rama Murthy vs. State of Karnataka (1996)
, the Court highlighted the urgent need for prison reform, including facilities for disabled inmates.
Stan Swamy Case (2021)
brought attention to the denial of essential assistive tools such as straws and sippers for Parkinson’s patients.
Past Committees on Prison Reform:
Mulla Committee (1983):
Recommended improved prison infrastructure, special provisions for disabled inmates, and measures to reduce overcrowding.
Suggested protection against abuse and better training for prison staff.
Krishna Iyer Committee (1987):
Focused on the welfare of
women prisoners
, recommending separate facilities, healthcare, and special provisions for pregnant inmates.
Justice A.N. Mulla Committee (1993):
Emphasized the need for humane treatment and rehabilitation, along with stricter measures against custodial torture.
Justice Krishna Iyer Report (2000):
Called for
legal aid for undertrial prisoners
mandatory inspections
to monitor prison conditions.
Model Prison Manual (2016):
Provided guidelines for
standardized prison reforms
, including healthcare, accessibility, and rehabilitation programs.
Despite being issued by the
Ministry of Home Affairs
, many states have failed to adopt its recommendations.
