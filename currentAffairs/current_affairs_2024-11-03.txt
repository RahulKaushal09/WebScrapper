**********Kodo millet
Recently, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) said that the deaths of elephants in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve could have been caused by “mycotoxins associated with kodo millet”.
About Kodo millet:
Kodo millet (Paspalum scrobiculatum) is also known as Kodra and Varagu in India.
It is one of the “hardiest crops, drought tolerant with high yield potential and excellent storage properties,” It is rich in vitamins and minerals.
It is a staple food for many tribal and economically weaker sections in India.
Required climatic conditions:
The tropical and subtropical regions are best suited for Kodo millet cultivation.
It is grown on poor soils, and widely distributed in arid and semi-arid regions.
The millet is believed to have originated in India and Madhya Pradesh (MP) is one of the largest producers of the crop, according to a 2020 research paper.
Apart from MP, the millet is cultivated in Gujarat, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, and parts of Tamil Nadu.
The crop is grown in India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and West Africa.
According to the research paper, “CPA (Cyclopiazonic acid) is one of the major mycotoxins associated with the kodo millet seeds causing kodo poisoning which was first recognised during the mid-eighties”.
Kodo poisoning occurs mainly due to the consumption of Kodo grains, when “maturing and harvesting if the grains had encountered with rainfall, resulting in a fungal infection leading to ‘poisoned Kodo’ which is locally known as ‘Matawna Kodoo’ or ‘Matona Kodo’ in northern India.”
Kodo poisoning mainly affects the nervous and cardiovascular systems and the chief symptoms include “vomiting, giddiness, and unconsciousness, small and rapid pulse, cold extremities, shaking of limbs and tremors.”

**********Tamil Nadu bracing for heatwaves
Why in news?
The Tamil Nadu government recently declared a heatwave as a State-specific disaster, enabling relief measures for those affected and compensation for families of heat-related casualties.
Interim actions to manage the heat will also be implemented, with funds allocated from the State Disaster Response Fund.
What’s in today’s article?
Rising Frequency of Heatwaves in India
Wet Bulb Temperature and Heat Stress
Recommended Government Actions
The World Meteorological Organization declared 2023 as the hottest year on record, with rising heatwave frequency attributed to anthropogenic climate change, as noted in the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report.
In India, heatwaves have intensified, with significant health impacts documented. A study in Environment International highlighted frequent and severe heatwaves in recent decades, such as:
1998
: Severe two-week heatwave, the worst in 50 years.
1999
: Unprecedented April heat, with temperatures over 40°C for more than 14 days.
2003
: Heatwave causing over 3,000 deaths in Andhra Pradesh.
2010
: Ahmedabad heatwave led to around 1,300 deaths.
2016, 2018, 2019, and 2023
: Extreme heatwaves across India.
In May 2024, a severe heatwave struck, with Churu, Rajasthan, reaching 50.5°C, the highest in eight years.
The heatwave resulted in 219 deaths and over 25,000 cases of heatstroke, impacting people across the plains and hills.
Heat waves
A Heat Wave is a period of abnormally high temperatures, more than the normal maximum temperature.
In India, Heat waves typically occur from March to June, and in some rare cases, even extend till July.
On an average, five-six heat wave events occur every year over the northern parts of the country.
Heat wave is considered if maximum temperature of a station
reaches at least 40°C or more for Plains and at least 30°C or more for Hilly regions
Based on Departure from Normal:
if Departure from normal is 4.50°C to 6.40°C; Severe Heat Wave: Departure from normal is >6.40°C
Based on Actual Maximum Temperature:
Heat Wave if
actual maximum temperature ≥ 45°C; Severe Heat Wave: When actual maximum temperature ≥47°C
Health Impacts of Extreme Heat
Rapid rises in heat gain compromises the body’s ability to regulate temperature.
It can result in a cascade of illnesses, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and hyperthermia.
Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can lead to conditions from heat exhaustion to heat stroke and exacerbates issues like renal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases.
Vulnerable populations—such as children, seniors, pregnant women, and outdoor workers—face higher risks. Extreme heat also impacts early childhood development, affecting learning, sleep, and mental health.
Wet bulb temperature is the
lowest temperature achievable by evaporative cooling
, such as sweating, and it measures the combined effects of heat and humidity.
Beyond this threshold, the body can no longer cool itself, leading to heat stroke or death.
This is particularly concerning for humid regions like India, with its extensive coastlines.
Research indicates that a wet bulb temperature exceeding 35°C for prolonged periods poses a universal heat stress limit, making heat dissipation impossible and inducing hyperthermia.
Equip health centers and hospitals with essential resources like ORS and medications.
Offer water and shelters for those working outdoors.
Adjust work hours to minimize outdoor exposure during peak heat times.
Long-term goals include addressing climate change causes and improving infrastructure to reduce vulnerability, especially in low-income communities.

**********Panel examining SC tag for all Dalit converts gets one-year extension
Why in news?
The Commission of Inquiry, led by former Chief Justice of India Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, has received a one-year extension to submit its report on granting Scheduled Caste (SC) status to Dalit converts.
Initially given a two-year deadline to report by October 10, 2024, the commission’s new submission date is October 10, 2025. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment issued this extension following the commission’s request for additional time to finalize its findings and recommendations.
The commission faced a delayed start due to logistical issues. It lacked a permanent office, an address, and adequate staff support for the initial months. Field visits, crucial for gathering data and public opinion, were postponed until August 2023 due to these constraints.
What’s in today’s article?
Background – Reason behind the formation of Commission, formation of commission
Previous Commissions on the issue of granting SC tag for all Dalit converts
Centre’s Position on Dalit Converts
Currently, the
Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950
stipulates that no person professing a religion different from Hinduism, Buddhism or Sikhism can be deemed to be a member of a Schedule Caste.
The original order under which only Hindus were classified was later amended to include Sikhs and Buddhists.
A batch of petitions were filed in the Supreme Court seeking the inclusion of Dalit Christians and Dalit Muslims and the removal of the religion criteria for inclusion as SCs.
In August 2022, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre to submit its current position on the issue.
In light of that, the Union Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment issued a notification in October 2022 to form a three-member Commission to study the matter.
The three-member Commission is headed by former Chief Justice of India, Justice K.G. Balakrishnan.
Objectives
To examine the issue of whether Scheduled Caste (SC) status can be accorded to Dalits who have over the years converted to religions other than Sikhism or Buddhism.
To look into the changes an SC person goes through after converting to another religion and its implications on the question of including them as SCs.
These will include examining their traditions, customs, social and other forms of discrimination and how and whether they have changed as a result of the conversion.
To examine any other related questions that it deemed appropriate, in consultation with and with the consent of the Central government.
The Commission has been given a two-year deadline to submit a report on the issue.
Various commissions have previously recommended the inclusion of Dalit Christians and Dalit Muslims under the Scheduled Caste category.
First Backward Classes Commission (1955) –
The First Backward Classes Commission was headed by
Kaka Kalelkar
The commission documented the existence of caste and caste discrimination among Indian Christians and Indian Muslims.
It concluded that
Dalit converts continued to face the same social disabilities even after leaving the Hindu fold
Rajinder Sachar Report (2006) –
In the 2006 Rajinder Sachar Report, it was observed that the social and economic of Dalits Muslims and Dalit Christians did not change even after conversion.
The report said, despite this, they have been deprived of SC status available to their Hindu counterparts.
National Commission for Scheduled Castes
/
National Commission for Minorities
Both these commissions had also recommended providing SC status to Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christians in affidavits filed before the Supreme Court in 2011.
The Centre has repeatedly defended its stance of excluding Dalit Christians and Muslims from SC status, citing the “foreign origins” of these religions.
In a 2019 affidavit to the SC, the Union govt rejected reports suggesting that Dalit converts to Islam and Christianity continue to face social disabilities due to caste identity.
The govt argued there was insufficient empirical evidence to support such claims across all cited reports.
Furthermore, it differentiated Dalit Buddhists from Dalit converts to Islam and Christianity.
The government stated that Dalit Buddhists converted voluntarily due to "innate socio-political imperatives," whereas Dalit conversions to Islam and Christianity may have occurred for other reasons.
However, it has supported the formation of the commission to thoroughly examine the matter, requesting the Supreme Court to delay its decision until the commission’s findings are submitted.

**********What are the Key Takeaways from COP-16?
What’s in Today’s Article?
About the Convention (Key Goals, Decisions & Discussions, etc.)
India’s Contribution to COP-16 (Key Contributions / Commitments, Significance, etc.)
Overview of the Convention:
The 16th meeting of the
Convention on Biological Diversity
(CBD) took place in
Cali, Colombia
Around 190 countries gathered to advance global biodiversity conservation efforts, continuing from the landmark agreements established at the
previous conference in Montreal, Canada, in 2022
The primary goal was to push forward
the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework
(KMGBF) and ensure the implementation of key biodiversity targets set for the decade leading up to 2030.
Key Goals of the KMGBF:
The 2022 Montreal meeting resulted in the
30-by-30 agreement
, a commitment to protect 30% of land and marine areas by 2030.
Currently, less than 17% of land and 10% of marine areas are protected globally.
In addition to this overarching goal, the KMGBF identified 23 action-oriented global targets for biodiversity conservation, including:
Reducing Invasive Species
: Halving the introduction of invasive alien species by 2030 and minimizing their impact.
Addressing Pollution
: Aiming to bring pollution levels down to tolerable limits across all sources by 2030.
Benefit-Sharing Mechanism
: Establishing a system to ensure fair benefit-sharing from the use of
genetic resources
digital sequence information
(DSI) derived from genetic materials.
Integrating Biodiversity into Development
: Ensuring biodiversity considerations are embedded in national policies, regulatory frameworks, and development planning.
However, implementing these targets requires substantial financial commitments.
Estimates suggest that
around $200 billion per year is needed
, but only a fraction of this has been pledged by international stakeholders.
Decisions and Discussions at COP-16:
While a final agreement on all issues was still pending, several important steps were taken:
Inclusion of Indigenous Communities
A subsidiary body was established to include indigenous groups in biodiversity discussions, recognizing their essential role in conservation efforts.
Digital Sequence Information (DSI) Agreement
One of the major topics was “
” related to the use of DSI.
This involves determining fair ways to share the benefits of products—such as medicines or drugs—that are developed using genetic material from various organisms.
While there was debate over who should contribute to this mechanism (countries or corporations), a multilateral solution was not fully agreed upon.
Adopted Agreements
Important texts were adopted on issues including the link between biodiversity and climate change, mainstreaming biodiversity, addressing invasive species, and technical support for KMGBF implementation.
India’s Contribution to COP-16:
India, a consistent participant in biodiversity COPs, was represented by a delegation led by the Minister of State for Environment, Kirti Vardhan Singh.
India presented an updated biodiversity action plan with several key highlights:
Budget Commitment
India plans to allocate approximately ₹81,664 crore
for biodiversity and conservation efforts from 2025 to 2030.
From 2018 to 2022, the
country spent ₹32,207 crore on conservation efforts
, primarily through central government funding and allocations to various ministries and statutory bodies.
Call for International Finance
Emphasizing the need for global financial support, India’s officials stressed the necessity of international resources to meet ambitious biodiversity targets, as highlighted in Target 19 of the KMGBF, which aims to mobilize $200 billion annually, including $30 billion through international financing.
Biodiversity Initiatives
India cited its contributions to global conservation, including the establishment of the
International Big Cat Alliance
for the protection of major big cat species, which serve as indicators of healthy ecosystems.
Furthermore,
India has expanded its Ramsar sites (wetlands of international importance) from 26 in 2014 to 85
, with plans to increase the number to 100 soon.
Significance and Future Implications:
The COP-16 conference highlights the global commitment to biodiversity conservation, with specific targets aimed at addressing issues like habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.
The inclusion of indigenous communities and the establishment of benefit-sharing mechanisms for genetic resources represent progressive steps toward equitable and inclusive conservation efforts.
However, the success of these initiatives heavily relies on adequate funding, which remains a challenge.
India’s proactive involvement and substantial budget commitments underscore its dedication to biodiversity conservation, while also emphasizing the need for collaborative international support to meet the KMGBF goals by 2030.

**********India’s Female Labour Force Participation
Why in News?
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) recently highlighted the challenges of low female labour force participation in India, primarily driven by the overwhelming caregiving responsibilities placed on women.
The report, titled
The Impact of Care Responsibilities on Women’s Labour Participation
, emphasises the need for investments in early childhood care and education (ECCE) to promote gender equality in the workforce.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Current Statistics on Women's Labour Force Participation in India
Global Perspectives on Care Responsibilities and Workforce Participation
Key Barriers to Women’s Workforce Inclusion and Way Ahead
Current Statistics on Women's Labour Force Participation in India:
High percentage outside workforce:
Over half of India’s women (53%) remain outside the labour force, largely due to unpaid caregiving duties, in stark contrast to only 1.1% of men.
Unpaid domestic and household work:
According to India’s Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) for 2023-24, around 36.7% of females and 19.4% of the workforce are involved in unpaid household work.
Gender disparities in domestic work:
The National Statistical Office (NSO) Time Use Survey 2019 shows that 81% of Indian females aged 6 and above spend over five hours daily on unpaid domestic activities.
Caregiving time differences:
Among those 6 years and older, 26.2% of females spend over two hours daily on caregiving versus 12.4% of males, indicating the disproportionate share borne by women.
Global Perspectives on Care Responsibilities and Workforce Participation:
Global findings:
In 2023,
748 million individuals globally
were not part of the labour force due to caregiving responsibilities, with
708 million of them being women
These numbers underline the
consistent gender imbalance
in care duties.
Northern Africa, Arab states, and Asia-Pacific regions
report the highest percentages of women outside the labour force due to caregiving, reflecting cultural and structural differences in caregiving expectations worldwide.
India, alongside countries like
Iran, Egypt, and Jordan
, has a high percentage of women restricted by caregiving responsibilities.
Countries with high female workforce participation:
Nations like
Belarus, Bulgaria, and Sweden
maintain lower proportions of women outside the workforce (less than 10%) by investing in ECCE, roughly 1% of their GDP.
Key Barriers to Women’s Workforce Inclusion and Way Ahead:
Barriers:
The ILO report highlights
low educational attainment, limited job opportunities, and inadequate infrastructure
as critical factors keeping women out of the workforce.
Cultural norms
around caregiving heavily restrict women’s labour market access, especially in
rural areas,
reinforcing existing gender inequalities.
Way ahead:
To address the high percentage of women outside India’s workforce due to care responsibilities,
substantial investments in the care economy
- especially in ECCE - are essential.
Such initiatives cannot only foster gender equality but also unlock economic potential by enabling more women to enter and thrive in the workforce.
