**********India’s Digital PRAGATI
Context
In an era where nations face increasing challenges in implementing large-scale infrastructure projects,
India has pioneered a groundbreaking approach through its PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation) platform.
This
innovative digital governance initiative, launched in 2015 by Prime Minister, exemplifies how technology,
combined with decisive leadership,
can transform infrastructure development, overcoming delays,
inefficiencies, and inter-agency bottlenecks.
PRAGATI’s success has not only propelled India’s infrastructure growth but also offers valuable lessons for other nations
, particularly in the Global South.
PRAGATI’s Role in India’s Infrastructure Transformation
Overcoming Traditional Bottlenecks
Infrastructure projects in India have historically faced numerous challenges
, including bureaucratic red tape, fragmented coordination between central and state governments, land acquisition issues, and environmental clearance delays.
PRAGATI directly addresses these bottlenecks by creating a unified platform
where all key stakeholders come together for monthly reviews led by the prime minister.
This regular oversight reduces the chances of issues being lost in administrative layers and ensures that problems are promptly identified
and resolved.
For example,
the completion of the Bogibeel Bridge over the Brahmaputra River illustrates PRAGATI’s effectiveness
in resolving long-standing issues.
Leveraging Technology Effectively
PRAGATI leverages advanced technological tools
to ensure comprehensive project monitoring and real-time data analysis.
Video conferencing allows direct communication among stakeholders spread across the country,
while drone feeds provide live visuals of project sites, enabling accurate assessments of on-ground progress.
Additionally,
the integration of data management systems allows officials to track project milestones,
delays, and resource allocation effectively.
These tools have proven critical in projects like the Chenab Bridge in Jammu and Kashmir.
As the world’s highest rail bridge, its construction presented significant engineering and logistical challenges.
PRAGATI’s ability to provide real-time oversight and facilitate inter-agency coordination
was instrumental in its successful completion.
Leadership-Driven Accountability
By directly involving the prime minister in monthly reviews,
the platform creates a culture of urgency and responsibility.
When top officials are aware that their decisions and progress will be scrutinised at the highest level,
they are more motivated to address issues proactively.
leadership model also underscores infrastructure development as a national priority,
inspiring cooperation across political and bureaucratic divides.
For instance,
PRAGATI’s inclusive approach has enabled the successful acceleration of projects in states governed by opposition parties
, demonstrating that the platform transcends political affiliations.
Beyond Accelerating Projects
It has fundamentally
reshaped how infrastructure is approached, shifting from a reactive to a proactive model.
Issues are anticipated and addressed before they escalate
, and solutions are formulated collaboratively, reducing overall costs and time.
transformation is especially crucial for large-scale, complex projects that require coordination across multiple levels of government
and diverse stakeholders.
Key Features, Innovations, and Socio-Economic Impact of PRAGATI
Key Features and Innovations
platform builds on lessons from SWAGAT,

, its influence extends to social development.
Projects ranging from rural electrification
to providing clean drinking water
have benefitted from its streamlined governance.
holistic approach underscores the interconnectedness of physical and social infrastructure
in fostering inclusive development.
According to the Reserve Bank of India,
each rupee spent on infrastructure yields a GDP gain of 2.5 to 3.5 rupees.
Such returns are pivotal as India aims to become the
world’s third-largest economy by 2027
The platform’s integration of technology and leadership serves as a blueprint for sustainable development
, especially for emerging economies.
Lessons for the Global South from PRAGATI’s Success
PRAGATI’s success provides essential insights for nations tackling similar challenges.
First,
technology alone cannot drive change
; sustained leadership is vital to ensure implementation.
Second,
digital platforms must bridge different levels of government,
facilitating cooperation while respecting local autonomy.
Third,
integrating diverse technological tools, such as video conferencing and drone monitoring, creates synergies
that enhance project oversight.
model is particularly relevant for initiatives like the African Union’s Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA),
which aims to close the continent’s infrastructure gap.

The Supreme Court's Case Lifecycle
Conclusion
Understanding Special Leave Petition (SLP) in India:
Meaning:
The SC is vested with extraordinary jurisdiction under
Article 136
of the Constitution, granting it the power to entertain SLPs.
Key features:
Scope:
Allows appeals from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence, or order made by any court or tribunal in India
, except military tribunals or courts-martial.
Can challenge interim or final orders, including interlocutory judgments.
Purpose:
Invoked when substantial questions of law or instances of gross injustice arise.
Discretionary power:
The SC has the authority to accept or decline SLPs. Filing an SLP is not a matter of right but is contingent upon the SC’s discretion.
Eligibility to file an SLP:
Any aggrieved party dissatisfied with:
A High Court judgment or decree.
Refusal of a High Court to grant a certificate of appeal to the SC.
Applicable to both civil and criminal matters.
Time limits for filing an SLP:
Against High Court (HC) judgments:
Within 90 days from the date of the judgment.
Against refusal of a certificate of fitness for appeal:
Within 60 days from the date of refusal by the HC.
Procedure for filing an SLP:
Filing the petition:
The SLP must outline all relevant facts and grounds for the SC to evaluate the appeal. It must include a declaration that no similar petition has been filed in any HC.
Role of Advocate-on-Record:
The petition must be duly signed by an Advocate-on-Record, authorised to represent clients in the SC.
Initial review by the SC:
The SC hears the petitioner to evaluate the merits of the case. If deemed fit, the opposing party is allowed to respond via a counter affidavit.

Historically,
the government has bowed to pressure to ban alcohol during the festival
While Tourism Minister supports easing restrictions on Indian-made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) to attract tourists, the Nagaland Baptist Church Council (NBCC) opposes the move.
NBCC asserts that visitors come to experience the state’s culture and heritage, not for alcohol.
Nagaland introduced complete prohibition in 1989 under the Nagaland Liquor Total Prohibition (NLTP) Act, supported by the Church and the Naga Mothers’ Association (NMA).
The prohibition traces its roots to the arrival of American Baptists in the 1870s, who introduced strict moral codes, labeling alcohol consumption as sinful and penalizing offenders.
By the 1890s, alcohol was banned, with violators expelled from the community.
Despite 87% of the population being Christian, predominantly Baptists, the traditional preparation and consumption of rice beer persist.
State mulling to repeal the prohibition law
In the August state assembly session, the Nagaland government discussed the effectiveness of the prohibition law, highlighting concerns over the “Health Hazards of Spurious Alcohol.”
Officials argued for regulating alcohol use instead of continuing prohibition, noting that the law’s objectives had not been achieved.
They pointed to ongoing liquor smuggling from Assam, the presence of bootleggers, spurious alcohol, and increased narcotic use.
The government is also motivated by potential excise revenue losses due to the policy.
While the government is considering a change, the Church’s strong opposition remains a significant barrier.

**********Collapse of France’s govt
Why in news?
French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned after far-right and leftist lawmakers united to pass a no-confidence vote, toppling his government just three months after it took office. This marks the first French government to fall via no-confidence in over 60 years, creating a political crisis and making Barnier the shortest-serving PM in modern French history.
His government will function in a caretaker role until a new one is appointed. President Emmanuel Macron is set to address the nation later.
What’s in today’s article?
Electoral System of France
Background of the current political crisis in France
Why did the French government fall?
What does this mean for France?
System of Governance
France operates under a
semi-presidential system
established by the Fifth Republic in 1958.
It combines
elements of parliamentary and presidential systems
, where both the President and Prime Minister hold executive powers.
This dual executive system ensures a balance of power, with the President focusing on foreign policy and strategic decisions, while the Prime Minister handles domestic affairs.
Structure of Parliament
:
The French Parliament is bicameral, consisting of:
National Assembly (Assemblée Nationale):
The lower house, with 577 deputies elected for five years through a two-round majority voting system.
Senate (Sénat):
The upper house, indirectly elected by an electoral college, primarily representing local authorities.
Role of the President
The President is the head of state and holds significant powers, including:
Appointing the Prime Minister.
Presiding over the Council of Ministers.
Commanding the armed forces.
Dissolving the National Assembly.
Calling referenda or emergency powers under Article 16 of the Constitution.
Role of the Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is the head of government, responsible for implementing laws, coordinating ministerial work, and managing domestic policies.
The PM is accountable to the National Assembly.
Election of the President
directly elected by citizens for a five-year term
two-round system
A candidate must secure an absolute majority in the first round or face a runoff between the top two candidates in the second round.
Appointment of PM
Selection by the President
The President has the sole authority to appoint the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister's appointment does not require a vote of approval from the National Assembly.
Typically, the appointee is someone capable of commanding a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, to ensure legislative stability.
Formation of Government
Once appointed, the Prime Minister proposes the composition of the government (Cabinet), which the President approves.
The Prime Minister and their government must present a
general policy statement
to the National Assembly and may seek a vote of confidence to establish legitimacy.
Tenure and Dismissal
The Prime Minister serves at the discretion of the President and can be dismissed at any time.
The National Assembly can force the resignation of the Prime Minister through a
vote of no confidence
Dissolution of Parliament
Political instability stemmed from President Emmanuel Macron's decision to dissolve parliament in June after centrist forces suffered a defeat in the European Parliament elections.
Fragmented Parliament
Early elections created three roughly equal parliamentary blocs—left, centre, and far-right—none with a majority.
The left-wing coalition, NFP, emerged as the largest force but was denied the right to form a government.
Macron appointed Barnier as Prime Minister, leading to a fragile alliance of centrists and centre-right MPs.
Barnier’s appointment led to a situation known as “
cohabitation”
in France — one in which the prime minister and the president belong to different parties.
Barnier’s Strategy:
Barnier attempted to gain far-right support by adopting rhetoric and policies addressing issues like crime, security, and immigration while introducing measures to ease the cost of living.
However, this strategy failed to secure long-term backing.
The French government fell after leftist lawmakers introduced a no-confidence motion in response to a controversial draft austerity budget.
The budget aimed to save €60 billion through spending cuts and tax hikes to reduce the deficit.
Prime Minister Michel Barnier invoked Article 49.3 of the Constitution to bypass parliamentary approval, triggering the motion.
Deep Political Uncertainty
The fall of the French government has plunged the nation into a period of instability, with fears of ending the year without a stable government or an approved 2025 budget.
This uncertainty has rattled investors, briefly pushing France’s borrowing costs above those of Greece.
Emergency Budget Provisions
Despite the crisis, France’s constitution allows a caretaker government to pass emergency laws to extend the previous year’s budget, ensuring public sector workers continue to be paid and avoiding a US-style shutdown.
Impact on the European Union
The political upheaval in France adds to the challenges facing the European Union, already dealing with the collapse of Germany’s coalition government and concerns over maintaining unity ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House.

**********Polavaram Project Controversy
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Inter-state water dispute; Resource distribution;
Why in the News?
The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) has restarted its protest against the Polavaram multipurpose project in Andhra Pradesh, claiming it will flood large areas in Malkangiri, Odisha, displacing many tribal communities.
What were the recommendations by the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal (GWDT) 1969?
The Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal (GWDT), was established to resolve water-sharing disputes concerning Godavari River water among the states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh (now Chhattisgarh). It made several key recommendations regarding the utilization of Godavari River water. Notable points include:
Water Allocation:
The Tribunal allowed Andhra Pradesh to divert 80 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) of Godavari water at 75% dependability for irrigation and other uses, which could also substitute releases from the Nagarjunasagar project for the Krishna delta.
Inter-State Agreements:
The Tribunal recognized various inter-state agreements that specified how water from the Godavari and its tributaries could be utilised, ensuring equitable distribution among the states involved.
Project Approvals:
The GWDT endorsed the construction of projects like
Polavaram,
provided they adhered to specified Full Reservoir Levels (FRL) and operational guidelines.
What are the social and environmental impacts of the Polavaram Project?
Social Impact:
The project is expected to displace over 150,000 people across approximately 276 villages, with many of these being tribal communities. For every five acres irrigated, one tribal family is projected to lose their land.
Infrastructure Strain:
The project has faced funding challenges for rehabilitation efforts, leading to halted work on necessary infrastructure like canals, which could exacerbate social tensions among displaced populations.
Environmental Impact:
The dam’s backwaters will submerge an estimated 3,731 hectares of forest land. The environmental impact assessments have raised concerns about ecosystem disruption, including increased vulnerability to erosion and regional landslides.
How is the project being managed politically and administratively?
National Project Status:
Declared a national project under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act of 2014, the Central Government is responsible for executing the project while ensuring compliance with environmental and rehabilitation norms.
Polavaram Project Authority:
A governing body has been established to oversee project execution, comprising representatives from both state and central governments. This authority is tasked with ensuring timely execution and adherence to regulatory requirements.
Political Dynamics:
The project has become a focal point for regional politics, particularly as parties like the BJD leverage opposition against it to bolster their regional identity amidst changing political landscapes in states like Odisha.
What are the legal and regulatory challenges faced by the Polavaram Project?
Ongoing Litigation:
Multiple states have challenged the project in court on grounds of inadequate environmental assessments and potential adverse impacts on their territories. Legal disputes have persisted since at least 2011, complicating project timelines.
Regulatory Compliance Issues:
Environmental clearances for the project have been contentious, particularly following changes in flood situation estimates that were not incorporated into updated designs. This has raised questions about compliance with earlier environmental impact assessments conducted in 2005.
Funding Challenges:
Financial constraints have hindered progress on rehabilitation efforts for displaced populations, leading to further legal scrutiny regarding compliance with social justice norms and commitments made during project approval processes.
Way forward:
Comprehensive Impact Assessment and Mitigation:
Conduct updated environmental and social impact assessments, including backwater studies, and implement robust mitigation measures for displaced populations, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks.
Strengthen Inter-State Collaboration:
Establish a transparent and inclusive mechanism involving all affected states to address concerns, promote equitable resource sharing, and expedite the resolution of legal and administrative challenges.
Mains PYQ:
Constitutional mechanisms to resolve the inter-state water disputes have failed to address and solve the problems. Is the failure due to structural or process inadequacy or both? Discuss.

**********Building on the revival of the manufacturing sector
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related manufacturing sector;
Why in the News?
Manufacturing output grew by 21.5% in 2022-23, but the GVA (Gross value addition) only grew by 7.3%. This is because input costs increased sharply by 24.4%, making production more expensive. As a result, even though industries produced more, their
profits and value-added
were
reduced.
Note:
GVA represents the
value added by industries,
while manufacturing output refers to total production. GVA reflects the economic contribution, factoring in costs like inputs.
What is the present scenario of India’s manufacturing sector?
Growth Momentum:
India’s manufacturing sector is experiencing significant growth, with a reported output increase of 21.5% in 2022-23, as indicated by the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI).
This growth is attributed largely to the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which has played a crucial role in boosting production across various sectors, including electronics, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles.
Sectoral Contributions:
Key sectors benefiting from the PLI scheme, such as basic metals and motor vehicles, collectively contributed 58% to total manufacturing output, showcasing robust performance driven by these incentives.
Positive Economic Indicators:
The gross value added (GVA) from manufacturing grew by 7.3%, highlighting an overall recovery in the sector post-COVID-19 disruptions.
What are the current challenges facing the manufacturing sector?
Input Cost Surge:
A significant challenge is the rising input prices, which increased by 24.4% in 2022-23. This surge has created a gap between manufacturing output growth and GVA growth, indicating that while production volumes are increasing, profitability is being squeezed due to higher costs.
Regional Imbalance:
Manufacturing activity is heavily concentrated in a few states—Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh—accounting for over 54% of total manufacturing GVA. This concentration limits equitable development across the country.
Skill Development Needs:
There is a pressing need for skill enhancement to meet the demands of evolving manufacturing technologies and processes.
How can digital transformation contribute to the future of manufacturing?
Adoption of Advanced Technologies:
Digital transformation can enhance manufacturing efficiency through automation, data analytics, and IoT (Internet of Things) integration. This can lead to improved productivity and reduced operational costs.
Supply Chain Optimization:
Digital tools can streamline supply chain management, making it more resilient to disruptions and better able to respond to global demand fluctuations.
Enhanced R&D Capabilities:
Investing in digital technologies can foster innovation in product development and advanced manufacturing techniques, positioning India as a leader in high-tech manufacturing sectors.
What strategies can be implemented to stimulate growth in manufacturing? (Way forward)
Expand PLI Scheme Scope:
To further stimulate growth, the PLI scheme should be extended to include labour-intensive sectors such as apparel and furniture, as well as emerging industries like aerospace and space technology. This could unlock new growth opportunities and reduce import dependency.
Streamline Import Regime:
Implementing a simplified three-tier tariff system for imports—0–2.5% for raw materials, 2.5%–5% for intermediates, and 5%–7.5% for finished goods—could help lower input costs and enhance competitiveness.
Focus on MSMEs:
Tailoring PLI incentives for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by lowering capital investment thresholds could empower these businesses to scale up and innovate.
Mains PYQ:
Can the strategy of regional-resource-based manufacturing help in promoting employment in India?
