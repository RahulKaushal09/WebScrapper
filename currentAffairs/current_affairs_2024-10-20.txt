African Baobab
New research by South African ecologists has refuted the claim that the African Baobab (Adansonia digitata) tree is dying due to climate change.
About African Baobab:
Baobabs are
long-lived deciduous
, small to large trees from 20 to 100 ft tall with broad trunks and compact tops.
These trees can live to become thousands of years old. The oldest baobab tree on record was the
Panke baobab in Zimbabwe
, which lived to be a venerable 2450 years old
Distribution:
These solitary trees are also incredibly resilient, thriving in dry, open areas such as the
savannas of southern Africa
and western Madagascar.
Ecological significance:
Baobab trees are fundamental to the entire dry African savanna ecosystem. They help keep
soil conditions humid, aid nutrient recycling
, and slow soil erosion with their massive root systems.
It
absorbs and stores water
from the rainy season in its massive trunk, producing a nutrient-dense fruit in the dry season, which can grow up to a foot long.
contains tartaric acid and Vitamin C
, serving as a vital nutrient and food source for many species.
These baobabs play a vital role in their ecosystem;
mitigate impacts of climate change,
providing food and shelter to animals and humans.
Its fruit is recognised as having high fibre content, acting as a natural prebiotic that promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut.

**********What is Vitiligo?
A new Kannada film is attempting to take the veil of stigma off from a vitiligo disease that is usually the subject of stereotypes and ignorance in India.
About Vitiligo:
It is a
chronic skin disorder
that occurs when melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin, are destroyed.
This condition arises due to the
malfunction or destruction of melanocytes
, the cells responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives skin its colour.
Those affected develop depigmented patches that may occur anywhere on the body, including
the skin, hair, and even the lining of the mouth.
While the precise cause of vitiligo remains unclear, research suggests it could result from a combination of
autoimmune responses, genetic predispositions, and environmental factors.
In autoimmune cases, the immune system mistakenly attacks its melanocytes, leading to a gradual loss of pigmentation.
The condition often begins with small white patches, which may slowly expand over time. Dermatologists point out that potential triggers could include oxidative stress, physical trauma, severe sunburn, or chemical exposure.
It can
develop at any age,
though it is most common before the age of 30.
The disease affects between 0.5 per cent and 2 per cent of the global population, with estimates suggesting that up to 100 million people worldwide live with the condition. It affects both men and women equally.
Treatment:
At present, vitiligo
does not have a permanent cure
However, several treatments aim to manage symptoms and restore skin pigmentation.
Options include topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy, which work to slow depigmentation and encourage the regeneration of melanocytes.

**********Marine Heat Wave
Researchers found that marine heat waves (MHWs) deep in oceans may be “significantly under-reported” and caused by ocean currents.
About Marine Heat Wave:
A marine heat wave is an
extreme weather event
It occurs
when the surface temperature
of a particular region of the
sea rises to 3 or 4 degree
Celsius above the average temperature for at least five days.
MHWs can last for weeks, months or even years, according to the US government’s agency National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
Impacts
MHWs are prolonged temperature events that can cause severe damage to marine habitats, such as impacts to
coral reefs and species displacement.
These events are becoming more
frequent due to global warming
, with notable occurrences off Australia's East Coast and Tasmania, as well as the northeast Pacific coast and North Atlantic.
Higher ocean temperatures, which are associated with MHWs, can make storms like
hurricanes and tropical cyclones stronger.
MHWs also
fuel the growth of invasive alien species
, which can be destructive to marine food webs.
When storms travel across hot oceans, they gather more water vapour and heat.
This results in more powerful winds, heavier rainfall and more flooding when storms reach the land — meaning heightened devastation for humans.

**********Did Google Violate Antitrust Laws in Epic Battle?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, Background of Legal Matter)
About Google & Apple Case (Ruling, Differences, Implications, Conclusion)
Introduction:
In a significant ruling on
October 7, 2024
, a U.S. District Court issued an injunction against
, accusing it of
violating antitrust laws
This ruling requires Google to make substantial changes to its
Play Store
policies, opening up opportunities for
third-party apps
and giving app developers the freedom to offer alternative payment methods within their apps.
The case, initiated by a company named
Epic Games
, highlights growing concerns about
monopolistic practices
by major tech companies, including
Background of the Legal Battle:
The conflict between
began in
August 2020
when Epic introduced a
direct payment option
for its popular game
Fortnite
, bypassing Google’s mandatory
in-app billing system
By doing so, Epic aimed to avoid paying Google’s
15-30% commission
on in-app purchases.
In response, both
removed
from their app stores, prompting
to file
antitrust lawsuits
against both companies.
Epic argued that Google’s policies were
anti-competitive
and that Google had made
exclusive deals
with companies like
Activision Blizzard
Nintendo
to ensure that their apps and games were distributed through the
These agreements allegedly harmed competition by forcing developers to use Google's payment system and limiting the availability of alternative payment options.
Google’s Defense and Appeal:
has appealed the ruling, expressing concerns that the court’s decision could compromise
consumer privacy
security
, and
within the app ecosystem.
The company claimed that the injunction might make it harder for developers to promote their apps and maintain a consistent user experience.
Despite these objections, the court's ruling is seen as a significant step in addressing
app store economy
It reflects broader concerns about how tech giants like Google control app distribution and impose restrictive terms on developers.
Key Differences Between the Google and Apple Cases & the Ruling:
While
filed similar lawsuits against
, the outcomes of the two cases have been different:
In the case against Apple, the court ruled that while
was not a monopoly in the app market, it still imposed
anti-competitive policies
The court ordered Apple to allow developers to offer
, but
Epic Games was required to pay damages for violating Apple’s developer agreement
In contrast, the jury trial against
provided
with a greater opportunity to present evidence of
Google’s exclusive deals
with developers.
This evidence led to a unanimous jury decision that
Google had violated antitrust laws, resulting in a more substantial ruling against Google compared to Apple
Impact on the App Economy:
This ruling could have profound effects on the global
app economy
, valued at over
$250 billion
. Some key implications include:
Developer-Friendly Terms
Both
may need to revise their app store policies, allowing developers to offer
and potentially reducing the high
commissions
they charge on in-app transactions.
Increased Competition
The decision may pave the way for
alternative app stores
, breaking the near-total control that
currently have over app distribution.
This could benefit
consumers
by lowering the prices of apps, subscriptions, and in-app purchases, as developers would no longer be forced to pay high fees to app store operators.
Challenges for Smaller Developers
On the flip side, smaller developers might struggle with
app discoverability
Currently, developers only need to promote their apps on two major platforms: the
Google Play Store
and the
Apple App Store
However, with the emergence of multiple app stores, it could become more difficult for smaller developers to attract attention and customers.
Conclusion:
Epic Games vs. Google
lawsuit marks a turning point in the ongoing debate over
digital monopolies
app store dominance
The injunction against
is expected to lead to more
open competition
fairer terms
for app developers, potentially transforming the way the
This ruling, along with similar cases, reflects a growing effort to
scrutinize big tech
and ensure a more competitive digital marketplace.
As the case progresses through appeals, the long-term impact on both
and the broader tech industry remains to be seen.
However, it is clear that this legal battle has sparked an important conversation about
fair competition
monopoly power
, and the future of app distribution.

**********Harnessing Mining Dust for Climate Solutions
Why in News?
In a surprising twist, a Darjeeling-based company,
Alt Carbon
, is turning mining dust into a climate-friendly solution.
With $500,000 in investments from carbon-credit companies, Alt Carbon is utilising a geo-chemical process known as enhanced rock weathering to tackle atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).
What’s in Today’s Article?
Understanding Enhanced Rock Weathering
The Innovative Approach of Alt Carbon
Appreciation and Apprehensions of Alt Carbon's Pioneering Method
Understanding Enhanced Rock Weathering:
The natural process:
Rocks naturally decompose over thousands of years, primarily through rain and heat.
This breakdown leads to the formation of bicarbonates as atmospheric CO2 reacts with minerals like calcium and magnesium.
These bicarbonates eventually make their way to the oceans via aquifers, where they have the capacity to store/ sequester carbon for thousands of years.
Carbon sequestration
is the process of capturing and storing atmospheric CO2. It is one method of reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere with the goal of reducing global climate change.
Accelerating carbon removal:
Given the urgent need to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels - supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - there’s a growing focus on accelerating natural carbon removal processes.
Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) offers a promising solution.
What is ERW?
Meaning:
It is a nature-based process that
accelerates the natural weathering of rocks to remove CO2
from the atmosphere and help address climate change:
ERW involves
spreading finely ground silicate rocks
(like basalt) on land.
This increases the surface area of the rock, which speeds up the chemical reactions between the rocks, water, and air.
Benefits
Carbon sequestration:
ERW can help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Improved soil:
ERW can improve soil pH, nutrient uptake, and fertility.
Reduced ocean acidification:
ERW can help mitigate ocean acidification.
Challenges:
The challenge lies in
making ERW a practical climate solution.
The processes of mining, grinding, and transporting rock
consume significant energy
, primarily from fossil fuels, which could negate the CO2 benefits.
Effective enhanced weathering
requires large areas of land
, necessitating participation from numerous farms or coastal regions to achieve meaningful carbon removal.
Enhanced weathering is simply
more expensive
than more direct ways of dealing with carbon emissions.
The Innovative Approach of Alt Carbon:
Using basaltic rock for ERW:
Basaltic rock, especially abundant in regions like Maharashtra and Gujarat due to the volcanic Deccan Traps, is
rich in minerals essential for carbon sequestration
By crushing this rock into a fine powder, Alt Carbon increases its effective surface area, enhancing the formation of bicarbonates significantly - by ten to a hundred times.
Application in Darjeeling:
Alt Carbon collects crushed basalt from Rajmahal mines and transports it to Darjeeling, where it is
applied to tea estates
This process not only
enriches the soil
but also
accelerates carbon sequestration
Currently, the company has utilised around 500 tonnes of basalt dust, aiming to sequester 50,000 tonnes of CO2 in the coming years, thus,
making mining dust climate-friendly.
Appreciation and Apprehensions of Alt Carbon's Pioneering Method:
Securing agreements:
Alt Carbon's innovative approach has
attracted attention from major companies.
They entered a partnership with Frontier - a consortium including McKinsey and Alphabet - to secure
carbon credits
for $500,000.
They also collaborated with NextGen to buy additional
at $200 per tonne.
While the principles of ERW are well understood,
discrepancies in measuring sequestered carbon
raise concerns and
emphasise the need for precise measurement protocols
Conclusion:
Alt Carbon’s pioneering work in using crushed basalt for ERW showcases
a novel method for carbon sequestration.
Going ahead, the company aims to make significant strides in
combating climate
change while simultaneously
improving agricultural practices

**********Parliamentary Committee to Review Armed Forces' Readiness for 'Non-Kinetic Warfare'
Why in news?
The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence has prioritized 17 subjects for deliberation, with a key focus on India’s preparedness to counter hybrid warfare.
Hybrid warfare describes a conflict in which non-kinetic (non-military) tactics are employed to complement military action.
What’s in today’s article?
Standing Committee on Defence (SCOD)
About
Non-kinetic warfare refers to
conflict methods that do not rely on traditional military force or physical destruction
Instead, it employs cyberattacks, electronic warfare, psychological operations, information manipulation, economic sanctions, and other strategies to disrupt an enemy’s infrastructure, economy, or morale.
It can
involve non-military actors
and often targets critical infrastructure like power grids, communication networks, and financial systems.
Examples of non-kinetic warfare
Russia-Ukraine Conflict
Alongside traditional military tactics, Russia has been accused of launching extensive cyberattacks against Ukraine's critical infrastructure.
Ukraine has faced disruptions to its power grid, communication systems, and government websites, as well as disinformation campaigns aimed at destabilizing the country.
Israel-Hamas Conflict
Both sides engaged in information warfare and cyberattacks.
Israel reportedly deployed cyber measures to block Hamas’s communications, while Hamas used propaganda and social media to influence public opinion and spread misinformation globally.
U.S. Election Interference
(2016)
The U.S. government accused Russia of meddling in its presidential election through disinformation campaigns, hacking of political parties, and social media manipulation to sway public opinion.
This is a classic case of information warfare aimed at destabilizing democratic processes.
Chinese Cyberattacks on the U.S.
China has frequently been accused of conducting cyber espionage against the United States, targeting government agencies, private companies, and defense contractors.
These cyberattacks aim to steal intellectual property, military technology, and sensitive information, undermining U.S. national security.
Pager Blasts in Lebanon
In a more localized example of non-kinetic warfare, pager blasts were reported in Lebanon.
These attacks were used to disrupt communication systems without the use of conventional military force, adding another layer to hybrid warfare tactics.
Difference from Kinetic Warfare
Kinetic warfare involves physical force, such as the use of weapons, troops, and military machinery to inflict damage and secure objectives through direct combat.
Non-kinetic warfare, on the other hand, achieves its goals through non-violent means, focusing on disabling or weakening an enemy without physical engagement.
While kinetic actions result in visible destruction, non-kinetic warfare can cause long-lasting disruption without leaving obvious physical traces.
Threats and Challenges
Cybersecurity Risks
: Cyberattacks can cripple national infrastructure, such as power grids, financial systems, and transportation networks.
Information Warfare
: Manipulating public opinion through misinformation or propaganda poses significant risks to societal stability.
Economic Warfare
: Sanctions or economic destabilization can severely impact a nation's economy without direct conflict.
Technology Dependence
: As more systems become digitally interconnected, the vulnerability to non-kinetic attacks increases.
Detection and Response
: Non-kinetic threats are harder to detect and defend against compared to physical warfare, requiring advanced surveillance, cybersecurity measures, and technological preparedness.
The Standing Committee on Defence constituted under Rule 331 C of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.
The Committee have the Ministry of Defence under its jurisdiction.
Members and tenure
The Committee consist of
31 Members
: 21 Members from Lok Sabha, nominated by the Speaker, Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha nominated by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha.
The Chairperson of the Committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst the Members of the Committee from Lok Sabha.
The term of office of the Members of the Committee does not exceed one year.
Functions of the Committee
To consider the Demands for Grants of the Ministry of Defence, make reports on the same and present them to the Parliament;
To examine such Bills pertaining to the Ministry of Defence as are referred to the Committee by the Speaker, Lok Sabha or the Chairman, Rajya Sabha as the case may be, and make reports thereon;
To consider Annual Report of the Ministry of Defence and make reports thereon; and
To consider National Basic Long-Term Policy Documents presented to the Houses, if referred to the Committee by the Speaker, Lok Sabha or the Chairman, Rajya Sabha as the case may be, and make reports thereon.

**********Stress factors for Indian Railways
Why in news?
In recent months, Indian Railways has experienced multiple train accidents. These include the derailment of eight coaches of the Agartala-Lokmanya Tilak Express in Assam on October 17, and a collision between a passenger train and a goods train near Chennai on October 11—both without casualties.
However, the Balasore accident on June 2, 2023, which claimed over 275 lives, highlighted serious safety concerns.
While pressure mounts on the Railways to enhance safety measures, it must also balance these demands with other operational and financial pressures that strain its resources.
What’s in today’s article?
Accidents in Indian Railways – Statistics
Kavach
Operating ratio of Indian Railways
Revenue stream of Indian Railways
Challenges
Railway accidents in India have significantly decreased from 1,390 annually in the 1960s to about 80 per year in the last decade.
However, 34 consequential accidents occurred in 2021-2022, 48 in 2022-2023, and 40 in 2023-2024.
These accidents cause injuries, fatalities, infrastructure damage, and traffic disruptions.
Public records indicate that 55.8% of train accidents are due to Railway staff failures, 28.4% result from non-staff errors, and 6.2% are due to equipment failure.
In high-profile cases like the Balasore and Kavaraipettai accidents, faulty signaling systems were cited as the cause.
About
It is India’s very own automatic protection system in development since 2012, under the name Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS).
Later, it got rechristened to Kavach or “armour”.
Basically, Kavach is a state-of-the-art electronic system which was designed to help the Indian Railways achieve Zero Accidents.
It has been indigenously developed by the Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) in collaboration with the Indian industry.
Deployment and financial implication
The ‘Kavach’ has been installed on just 2% of Indian Railways' route length by February 2024.
Despite calls for faster implementation after the Balasore accident, the system costs ₹50 lakh per kilometre and ₹70 lakh per locomotive.
Analysis shows that its full implementation would account for less than 2% of the Railways' annual capital expenditure.
IR is facing criticism of the slow implementation.
Effectiveness of Kavach in preventing accidents
Since 1990-1991, the Railways has classified nearly 70% of all major accidents as derailments, but only 2% of them were due to collisions.
Kavach is effective only in avoiding collision.
‘Kavach’ also may not have prevented the Kavaraipettai accident because the relevant error happened beyond the minimum margins ‘Kavach’ requires to assist.
Operating Ration of Indian Railways (IR)
The Railways' operating ratio (OR), which measures how much is spent to earn ₹100, is projected at ₹98.2 for 2024-2025.
It has shown a slight improvement from ₹98.7 in 2023-2024 but a decline from ₹97.8 in 2016.
A higher OR leaves less for capital expenditure
, making the Railways more reliant on budgetary support and Extra-Budgetary Resources (EBRs).
Since the government merged the railway budget with the general budget in 2016-2017, the Railways gained easier access to gross budgetary support.
However, EBR-related dues have surged, rising from 10% of revenue receipts in 2015-2016 to 17% this year.
Revenue generation by Indian Railways
Freight Services Performance
Freight services account for
65% of Indian Railways' internal revenue
While both passenger and freight revenues are rising,
freight rates increased three times faster than passenger rates between 2009 and 2019
Nearly 30% of the railway network is overutilized, slowing freight movement to around
26 km/hr in 2016
, which has hindered revenue growth.
Despite the government's push for Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) since 2005,
only the eastern DFC is fully operational
The western DFC is partly ready, while others, like the east-west and north-south sub-corridors, are still in planning.
Freight revenue heavily depends on coal, which accounted for half of the revenue and 45% of volume in the 2024-2025 estimates
However, the government’s shift toward renewable energy threatens future coal demand.
Additionally, the Railways faces challenges in maintaining infrastructure, with capital outlay for track renewal dropping to 7.2% in 2023-2024.
Appropriations to the Depreciation Reserve Fund also fell 96%, further impacting maintenance and replacement of depreciating assets.
Passenger Services Revenue
While freight services generate profits, passenger services incur significant losses
In 2019-2020, passenger revenue was over ₹50,000 crore, but losses totaled ₹63,364 crore.
Losses increased to ₹68,269 crore in 2021-2022, largely due to the pandemic.
In 2024-2025, study estimated passenger revenue at ₹80,000 crore, boosted by new trains, including the Vande Bharat, on high-traffic routes.
The Railways has replaced many cheaper sleeper and second-class coaches with more expensive AC coaches to raise passenger revenue.
Despite these efforts, the last fare rationalization occurred in 2020.
Balancing Affordability and Profitability
Indian Railways faces the challenge of balancing its
goal of providing affordable travel while striving for profitability
Its financial struggles are worsened by rising wage and pension bills, as well as fuel costs.
Stressful Working Conditions
Locomotive pilots experience high-stress conditions, including 12-hour shifts, especially in zones with heavy freight traffic.
Frequent changes in standard operating procedures add to the pressure, further impacting safety.
Network Congestion and Safety System Limitations
High network congestion has reduced the effectiveness of safety systems like ‘Kavach’ and a walkie-talkie-based system meant to warn trackside workers of oncoming trains.
These systems are less effective in congested areas where trains run close together, as signals are spaced only 1 km apart, limiting their functionality.
Revenue Shortfalls Affecting Safety
The Railways’ inability to generate enough revenue to fill gaps in budgetary support, coupled with increasing demands on revenue receipts and the need to ease congestion, has made it difficult to maintain and improve safety measures.
This constant struggle to catch up with growing needs affects overall safety efforts.
