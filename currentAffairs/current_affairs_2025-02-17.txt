MUNICH SECURITY CONFERENCE
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Context:
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a strong rebuke to U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance’s attack on Europe’s stance toward hate speech and the far right, saying it was not right for others to tell Germany and Europe what to do.
Background: –
Mr. Vance had lambasted European leaders on the first day of the Munich Security Conference, accusing them of censoring free speech and criticising German mainstream parties’ “firewall” against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
About Munich Security Conference (MSC)
The Munich Security Conference (MSC) is an annual forum that brings together global leaders, policymakers, and experts to discuss international security issues.
The MSC was founded by a German official and publisher Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist at the peak of the Cold War in 1963. The conference initially focused on military issues and was mainly attended by Western countries, who came together to display a united front against Soviet communism.
After the end of the Cold War, the conference expanded its agenda beyond defence and security to include issues like climate change and migration. It also began inviting leaders from eastern nations, including Russia, India and China.
Today, the MSC, held in February every year, “seeks to promote trust and contribute to the peaceful resolution of conflicts by facilitating ongoing, curated, yet informal dialogue within the international security community”.
Key Takeaways from the Munich Security Conference (MSC) 2025
Shift in the Transatlantic Security Framework
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has been the cornerstone of European security, ensuring collective defense against external threats. However, recent developments indicate a fundamental shift. While U.S. remains a NATO member, European nations can no longer assume automatic U.S. military support in times of crisis.
U.S.-Russia Talks on Ukraine: A Policy Shift
The U.S. administration has initiated diplomatic talks with Russia to negotiate an end to the Ukraine war, despite strong opposition from European leaders and Kyiv.
Notably, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has not been invited to these talks, raising concerns about Ukraine’s exclusion from crucial negotiations affecting its sovereignty and security. The move has further strained U.S.-Europe relations.
Increased Defense Expenditure for European NATO Members
The MSC discussions underscored the necessity for Europe to escalate its defense spending in response to Russia’s growing military assertiveness. The current NATO-mandated minimum of 2% of GDP on defense is now expected to rise to 3%.
While the U.S. has historically provided substantial military aid to Ukraine, European nations have now surpassed the U.S. in total financial and humanitarian assistance.
U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s Controversial Speech
U.S. V.P’s speech was widely perceived as critical of European policies. Instead of reaffirming U.S. support for Ukraine, his remarks focused on Europe’s handling of migration, free speech, and governance issues.
His address was met with criticism from European leaders. However, the speech was well-received by certain political factions, including President Trump. This development signals growing ideological divergences between U.S. and Europe.
Economic Tensions and U.S.-Europe Trade Disputes
Amid the discussions at MSC, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, effective from March. This decision exacerbates economic tensions between the U.S. and Europe, adding to existing disputes over trade policies and defense commitments.

DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS) ATTACK
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
In January, web-based portal Kaveri 2.0, which streamlines property registrations in Karnataka, faced sporadic, crippling server outages. On investigating the outage, the Revenue Department and E-Governance Department concluded that it was a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
DDoS attacks can lead to a service downtime, which is the primary goal of a DDoS attack — to render a service unavailable, leading to a disruption or potential loss of revenue.
Key takeaways
A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic.
Unlike a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which typically involves a single source, a DDoS attack leverages multiple compromised systems, often infected with malware, to generate the traffic. These compromised systems are collectively known as a botnet. Such attacks may be aimed at saturating the bandwidth of a site, exploiting weaknesses in the network protocol stack, or targeting specific weaknesses in applications or services.
While DDoS attacks do not directly steal data, they can be used as a distraction while other forms of cyberattacks, such as data breaches, are executed.
The Kaveri 2.0 portal, critical for property registrations, experienced performance issues recently. Fake accounts were created, and entries were made into the database using these accounts, overwhelming the system. The attack involved 62 email accounts originating from 14 IP addresses, highlighting the distributed nature of the assault.
Ways to mitigate such attacks
Organisations implement advanced traffic filtering mechanisms to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic. Monitoring tools can help identify unusual traffic patterns and take pre-emptive actions.
Enforcing rate limiting can control the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame, preventing the system from being overwhelmed.
Bot detection technologies, such as CAPTCHA challenges and behavioural analysis, can identify and block automated tools or bots.
Robust authentication mechanisms and regular security audits can strengthen the security of online services and prevent unauthorised access.

PRESIDENT’S RULE
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
Four days after Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh’s resignation, the Union government announced that President’s rule has been implemented in the violence-hit State.
The violence between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, ongoing since May 2023, has claimed above 250 lives and displaced over 60,000 people.
The conflict originated from the Meitei demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status, which the Kukis opposed, fearing loss of job opportunities and other affirmative actions meant for STs.
Emergency provisions, inspired by the German Constitution, protect India’s sovereignty, unity and security. They empower the Central government to address extraordinary crises by temporarily assuming control.
The Constitution provides for three types of emergencies — national (Article 352), State (Article 356) and financial (Article 360).
In Manipur, the President has proclaimed a “state emergency” — popularly known as “President’s Rule” or “Constitutional Emergency” — by exercising powers under Article 356. This fulfils the Union’s obligation under Article 355 to protect States against ‘external aggression’ and ‘internal disturbance’ and to ensure that State governments operate as per the Constitution.
When a State’s “constitutional machinery” fails due to non-performance or malperformance, Article 356(1) empowers the President to issue a proclamation — if she is satisfied that the State government cannot function constitutionally. This effectively transfers all executive functions of the State to the Centre and legislative functions to Parliament while leaving the High Court’s (HC) powers unaffected.
Additionally, Article 365 provides that if a State fails to comply with any Union directions under constitutional provisions, the President may declare a “Constitutional Emergency.”
As per Clause 3 of Article 356, the proclamation must be laid before each House of Parliament, and unless approved by a ‘simple majority’ in both Houses, it ceases after two months. Once approved, it remains effective for six months from the proclamation date, with further six-month extensions requiring additional Parliamentary approval.
Renewal beyond one year is allowed only if two conditions are met — an Emergency has been declared in the country or any part of the State, and if the Election Commission certifies that President’s rule is necessary due to difficulties in conducting State elections. In no case can the proclamation remain effective for more than three years.
How is a ‘constitutional emergency’ different from a ‘national emergency’?
Article 352 governs the proclamation of a “national emergency,” which has been invoked thrice — during the 1962 India-China war, the 1971-armed conflict with Pakistan, and in 1975 on grounds of “internal disturbance.”
Unlike a “State emergency,” proclaiming a “national emergency” requires that the President be satisfied that India’s security — or any part of its territory — is threatened by war, external aggression, or armed rebellion.
The 44th Constitutional amendment (1978) introduced safeguards against misuse. It replaced “internal disturbance” with “armed rebellion”, mandated a written recommendation from the Cabinet, and shortened the parliamentary approval window from two months to one month. It clarified that Articles 20 and 21 cannot be suspended, and that the President must revoke the proclamation if the Lok Sabha passes a resolution disapproving it. The amendment restored judicial review of the President’s satisfaction in proclaiming an emergency, a safeguard removed by the 38th Constitutional amendment (1975).
Unlike a “constitutional emergency” (which can last up to three years), a “national emergency” has no time limit.
Additionally, while the President’s rule (Article 356) requires a ‘simple majority’ for parliamentary approval, a national emergency needs a ‘special majority’.
In a national emergency, the State executive and legislature continue to function, whereas under President’s Rule, the State executive is dismissed, and the legislature is suspended or dissolved.
President’s rule does not affect citizens’ fundamental rights, unlike a national emergency, where under Article 358, freedoms under Article 19 become inoperative, and the President may suspend other fundamental rights, except Articles 20 and 21.

THE SCHEDULED TRIBES AND OTHER TRADITIONAL FOREST DWELLERS (RECOGNITION OF FOREST RIGHTS) ACT, 2006
Sixteen years since The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (also known as FRA) was introduced in January 2008, forest dwellers continue to face significant hurdles.
Only three states in India have recognised a notable number of Community Forest Resource (CFR) rights, with Maharashtra being the only state where these rights have been operationalised, an analysis has noted.
The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act (FRA), is a significant piece of legislation in India aimed at recognizing and vesting forest rights in forest-dwelling communities.
Recognition of Forest Rights:
The Act grants legal recognition to the rights of Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFDs) who have been living in forests for generations but lacked legal ownership.
It acknowledges both individual rights (e.g., land rights) and community rights (e.g., rights over common resources).
Eligibility Criteria:
Scheduled Tribes (STs): They must be residing in the forest land before 13th December 2005 and depend on forests for livelihood.
Other Traditional Forest Dwellers: Non-tribal communities who have been living in forests for at least three generations (75 years) prior to December 13, 2005, and depend on forests for their livelihood.
Land Ceiling: The Act sets a ceiling on the extent of land that can be recognized under individual rights, typically up to 4 hectares, subject to state-specific variations.
Types of Rights Recognized:
Individual Rights: Rights to land and resources that have been traditionally accessed by individuals or families.
Community Rights: Rights over common property resources, including grazing grounds, water bodies, and traditional seasonal resource access.
Right to Protect and Conserve: Rights to protect, regenerate, conserve, or manage any community forest resource traditionally protected and conserved by the community.
Right to Intellectual Property: Rights over traditional knowledge related to biodiversity and cultural diversity.
Right to Rehabilitation: If eviction is required for conservation, proper rehabilitation must be ensured.
Gram Sabha’s Role:
The Gram Sabha (village assembly) plays a crucial role in initiating the process of determining forest rights.
It is responsible for receiving claims, consolidating and verifying them, and then passing resolutions to be forwarded to higher authorities.
No forest rights can be acquired or transferred without the consent of the Gram Sabha.
Claims Process:
Forest-dwelling communities can file claims for recognition of their rights.
The claims are verified and approved at various levels, including the Gram Sabha, Sub-Divisional Level Committee (SDLC), and District Level Committee (DLC).
Protection from Eviction:
The Act provides protection to forest-dwelling communities from eviction or displacement without the recognition and verification of their rights.
It ensures that no member of a forest-dwelling community can be evicted until the process of recognition and verification of rights is complete.

INDIRECT PROMPT INJECTION ATTACKS
Indirect prompt injection, a technique that manipulates chatbots into executing malicious commands, has become a significant concern for developers and users alike.
Despite efforts by tech giants like Google and OpenAI to fortify their systems, hackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities, leading to potential data breaches and misinformation.
Indirect prompt injection attacks are a significant security concern in the realm of generative AI systems, particularly those utilizing large language models (LLMs).
Unlike direct prompt injections, where attackers input malicious commands directly into the AI system, indirect prompt injections involve embedding harmful instructions within external data sources that the AI system accesses. This can lead the AI to perform unintended actions, potentially compromising data integrity and user trust.
Mechanism of Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks:
Embedding Malicious Instructions: Attackers insert concealed commands into data sources such as emails, documents, or web content. For instance, a malicious prompt might be hidden within an email that, when processed by an AI assistant, instructs the system to leak sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.
Exploitation Through Data Access: When the AI system accesses and processes this tainted data, it inadvertently executes the embedded instructions. This occurs because the AI cannot distinguish between legitimate data and malicious commands within the content it processes.
Potential Risks:
Data Exfiltration: The AI might be manipulated to extract and transmit confidential information to unauthorized entities.
Propagation of Malicious Content: In scenarios where AI systems generate or summarize content, they might unknowingly disseminate harmful instructions embedded within the source material.
Unauthorized Actions: AI systems integrated with tools or plugins could be directed to perform actions beyond their intended scope, such as sending unauthorized emails or accessing restricted data.
Mitigation Strategies:
Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement rigorous checks to detect and neutralize hidden commands within external data before processing.
Contextual Differentiation: Enhance the AI’s ability to distinguish between executable instructions and regular data content, reducing the likelihood of unintended command execution.
Restricting External Data Access: Limit the AI system’s interaction with untrusted or unverified data sources to minimize exposure to potential threats.
Human Oversight: Incorporate human review mechanisms for AI outputs, especially when dealing with sensitive information or actions, to catch anomalies.

**********Kalyana Chalukyas
Three Kannada inscriptions from the Kalyana Chalukya era were noticed for the first time in Kankal village in the Pudur mandal of Vikarabad district.
About Kalyana Chalukyas:
The Chalukyas ruled over the
Deccan
plateau
between the
6th and 12th centuries.
During that period, they ruled as
three closely related
but
individual dynasties
- ehe
Chalukyas of Badami,
Chalukyas of Kalyani (Western Chalukyas
) and the
Chalukyas of Vengi (Eastern Chalukyas).
Primarily a Kannadiga dynasty, they were known after their
capital city, Kalyani.
It is present in the
modern-day Bidar district of Karnataka.
empire
was
established by Tailapa II
when the Western Chalukya
was a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta Empire
and Tailapa II governed Tardavadi in the Bijapur district of Karnataka.
In the 300 years long rule in the western Deccan and southern part of the Indian peninsula, Chalukya of Kalyani expanded and reached the
zenith of power during the rule of Vikramaditya VI (1076-1126 CE).
It is considered the most successful period of the later Chalukya rulers in Karnataka’s history, and many scholars refer to this period as the
‘Chalukya Vikrama era’.
Vikramaditya VI was not only controlling feudatories in the northern region, such as Kadamba Jayakesi II of Goa, Silhara Bhoja and the Yadava King, but also, he
won several battles against the Chola dynasty.
Decline:
After Vikramaditya VI’s death, the
consistent confrontation with the Chola
dynasty exploited both empires and gave opportunities to their subordinates to rebel.
After 1126, the Western Chalukya empire started declining, and by the time of Jagadhekamalla II, everything was falling apart.
Administration, Art, and Architecture:
The Western Chalukya administration was mainly
hereditary
, where the king passed his powers to the male heir and brother in the absence of a male heir.
The whole
kingdom was divided and managed by feudatories
such as the
Hoysala and the Kakatiya.
While the Chalukya Dynasty maintained a
great army of infantries, cavalries
, elephant units, etc, the Western Chalukyas followed the trend and achieved a great extent of power.
They were
primarily Hindus
but also acknowledged and
tolerant of Buddhism and Jainism.
They contributed greatly to the
development of Kannada and Telugu literature.

The Western Chalukya dynasty is considered to be a
crucial era for the evolution of Deccan architecture.
Their art is also called the ‘
Gadag style’
because numerous temples were built in the Tungabhadra-Krishna doab region in the present-day Gadag district.
Mallikarjuna temple of Bellary
Siddeshvara temple in Haveri, Kallesvara temple in Davangere district
, etc are a few of the finest examples of later Chalukya architecture.

**********Tech companies, regulators flag romance scams
Why in news?
In February, often called the "month of love," experts and authorities are warning about
rising romance scams
involving emotional manipulation, deceit, and financial fraud.
According to a Moody’s report,
India ranked third globally in new romance scam
profiles in 2024, accounting for 12% of the total, behind the US (38%) and Nigeria (14%).
Moody’s recorded 1,193 new scam-related entities, marking a 14% increase from 2023.
What’s in today’s article?
Romance Scams
Tech Companies' Response to Romance Scams
Other Major Fraud Trends in Focus
Romance frauds typically occur through dating apps and social media, where scammers create fake online profiles to lure victims.
According to the
Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)
, fraudsters gain trust and then demand money, gifts, bank details, or intimate content.
These scams often pose a risk to victims’ personal safety, as criminals may belong to organized networks.
Rise of Romance Scams During Covid-19
The Covid-19 pandemic saw a sharp increase in such scams, as fraudsters exploited people’s isolation and emotional vulnerability.
A technique called “love bombing”—where scammers excessively express affection to gain victims’ trust—was commonly used.
Modus Operandi of Scammers
As per the FBI, scammers use fake identities to manipulate victims emotionally and financially.
Meta highlights that scammers often pose as attractive and successful individuals, using cold messages and fake stories to gain trust before requesting money or promoting fraudulent investments.
Financial and Reputational Risks
Moody’s warns that money from romance scams, including sextortion, is often laundered through banks, exposing financial institutions to reputational damage and legal penalties.
Sextortion—which mainly targets teenage boys—involves extortion using fake profiles to solicit explicit content, later used to blackmail victims.
Preventive Measures
Authorities advise people to avoid sending money or sharing sensitive personal information with strangers online and to be cautious about the details they share on social media.
Meta’s Measures Against Scammers
Meta, which owns Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, is actively working to combat romance scams by:
Removing Malicious Accounts
: Automated systems detect and eliminate fake profiles.
Safety Notices on Messenger
: Alerts users when chatting with
suspicious accounts
, especially those based in other countries.
Teen Protection on Instagram
: Testing
safety nudges
for teenagers to caution them about suspicious interactions.
Call Blocking on WhatsApp
: Users can
silence calls from unknown numbers
to prevent scam-related contact.
Match Group’s AI-Based Scam Prevention
(which owns
Tinder, Hinge, and OkCupid
) is using
AI tools
to detect suspicious
words and phrases
to prevent fraud.
Key measures include:
In-App Warnings and Education
: Pop-up alerts and educational features inform users about scams.
Collaboration with Law Enforcement
: Working with cybercrime investigators to run awareness campaigns on identifying scam behaviors.
Google’s Measures Against Online Fraud

**********The Silent Crisis of Rat-Hole Mining
Context
Illegal mining has emerged as a
persistent and hazardous problem in Assam and Meghalaya
, leading to devastating consequences for both human lives and the environment.
recent tragedy in Umrangso, Assam
, where nine labourers were trapped in a flooded mine, is yet another example of the ongoing crisis.
Despite repeated accidents and legal interventions,
illegal mining continues unabated, largely due to weak enforcement
, political and economic interests, and inadequate policy reforms.
The Persistence of Illegal Mining
The Historical Roots
The proliferation of illegal coal mining in Assam and Meghalaya can be
traced back to the 1980
s when industrial demand from West Bengal and Bangladesh led to the expansion of small-scale mining operations.
The region's
difficult terrain made mechanised extraction challenging
, prompting the widespread adoption of rat-hole mining, a dangerous technique involving narrow tunnels that put miners at significant risk.
Two forms of rat-hole mining prevail:
side-cutting along hill slopes and box-cutting, where pits are dug up to 400 feet deep and coal is extracted horizontally.
Influence of Powerful Coal Mafias
Despite a ban imposed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2014, upheld by the Supreme Court in 2019,
illegal mining continues under the influence of powerful coal mafias
and bureaucrats.
Migrant labourers
, many trapped in cycles of debt and bonded labour, are
lured into these hazardous jobs
by exploitative labour agents known as ‘Sardars.’
Disturbingly, reports indicate that
children are trafficked into these mines
due to their small stature, which allows them to navigate the narrow tunnels.
Legal and Administrative Challenges
Illegal mining persists is the
failure of state authorities to enforce existing laws.
While the
Meghalaya government has sought to exempt itself
from national mining regulations
under Schedule 6
of the Constitution, this effort remains unsuccessful.
Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act)
obligates states like Meghalaya and Assam to prevent illegal mining, but enforcement remains lax.
Moreover, political and economic interests play a crucial role in sustaining illegal mining.
Coal mining generates substantial revenue
, and local politicians often have stakes in these operations, leading to selective enforcement or outright neglect of legal provisions.
Whistleblowers and activists
who attempt to expose these violations
face threats
, further weakening accountability mechanisms.
Consequences of Illegal Mining: Environmental and Human Costs
The consequences of illegal mining are
severe, affecting both human lives and the environment.
Accidents like the one in Umrangso are common,
with at least 30 miners losing their lives
in Meghalaya over the past five years due to similar incidents.
The hazardous working conditions of rat-hole mines
expose labourers to fatal risks,
with many deaths going unreported.
Environmentally, illegal mining has caused severe degradation
. The unregulated extraction of coal has led to deforestation, water contamination, and soil erosion.
abandoned mine openings
, estimated to be around 26,000,
pose ongoing risks, serving as potential death traps
for both miners and wildlife.
The Way Forward: The Need for a Multi-Faceted Approach
Stricter Legal Enforcement
MMDR Act must be amended to explicitly criminalise rat-hole mining,
with harsher penalties under Section 21.
Additionally, states should implement localized frameworks under Section 23C to ensure tailored enforcement mechanisms.
Alternative Livelihoods
The reliance on illegal mining stems from economic necessity.
Promoting alternative employment opportunities, such
as eco-tourism and sustainable forestry, can reduce dependence on coal mining
and provide safer, legal sources of income.
Technological Solutions
Advanced monitoring techniques,
such as satellite-based surveillance
, can help track illegal mining activities.
Ministry of Mines’ Mining Surveillance System
, which has been successful in Karnataka,
could be implemented in Assam and Meghalaya
to enhance enforcement.
Community Involvement
Strengthening local governance by enforcing the Forest Rights Act, 2006,
and ensuring community consent before granting mining permits can help hold mining operations accountable.
Empowering indigenous communities
in decision-making processes can lead to more sustainable resource management.
Conclusion
Gauhati High Court’s suo motu cognizance of the Assam mining tragedy offers a renewed opportunity
for meaningful reform.
However,
judicial interventions alone will not be enough unless proactive measures are taken to enforce existing laws
, promote alternative livelihoods, and leverage technology to curb illegal mining.
continued failure of Assam and Meghalaya to prevent such activities
not only constitutes administrative negligence but also
violates the fundamental right to life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution.

Editorial Analysis
**********The Panchayati Raj Movement is in Distress
Context
73rd Amendment to the Indian Constitution
, enacted in 1992, marked a transformative moment in India’s governance,
introducing a decentralised system
through panchayati raj institutions (PRIs).
This amendment
sought to bring democracy to the grassroots
by establishing local self-government, ensuring representation, and empowering marginalised communities.
However, despite its initial success,
the panchayati raj system is currently facing a crisis
due to systemic and policy-level challenges.
An Overview of Panchayati Raj System
The Panchayati Raj System was introduced through the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992,
to establish decentralised governance
at the grassroots level.
system is based on the principle of democratic decentralisation
, giving power to local self-governments in rural areas.
Its roots trace back to ancient India, but it was
formally recommended by the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee (1957),
which proposed a three-tier structure, Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, and Zila Parishad.
The primary purpose of the system is to
promote participatory democracy, empower rural communities,
and ensure effective local administration.
Panchayats have been given
constitutional status under Article 243
, with elections held every five years to ensure accountability.
They are
responsible for local governance, including rural development, sanitation, water supply, education
, and poverty alleviation programs.
States have been granted flexibility in structuring their PRIs, leading to variations across India.
Over the years,
the system has strengthened grassroots democracy but still faces challenges
like lack of financial autonomy, political interference, and capacity building issues.
The Achievements of Panchayati Raj Institutions
The panchayati raj system has made
significant strides in democratising local governance.
Elections to PRIs have become highly competitive, and political participation at the grassroots level has increased.
One of the most notable achievements has been the empowerment of women in leadership roles, with
nearly 14 lakh elected women representatives
currently serving in panchayats.
Furthermore, PRIs have
played a crucial role in implementing various social sector programs
, particularly in rural development initiatives.
Constitution mandated State Finance Commissions to allocate financial resources to local governments
, ensuring that panchayats had the necessary funds to carry out their responsibilities.
These achievements
underscore the importance of panchayati raj institutions
in developing inclusive and participatory governance.
Despite these accomplishments,
the panchayati raj system is facing a decline
due to several structural and policy-related challenges.
The Decline of Panchayati Raj: Key Challenges
Stagnation in Administrative Decentralisation
While the initial phase of the panchayati raj movement saw significant progress in administrative devolution,
momentum has since stalled.
Effective local governance requires state governments to delegate administrative control and staff to PRIs, yet this has not been fully realised.
A 2022 report by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj
revealed that
less than 20% of Indian states have transferred all 29 subjects
listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution
to local bodies.
Without adequate administrative authority, panchayats struggle to function effectively.
Erosion of Fiscal Autonomy
Financial autonomy is crucial for effective local governance, but
panchayats have increasingly become dependent on centrally sponsored schemes.
direct financial transfers
to PRIs have increased over time, untied grants, which allow local governments to make independent decisions,
have been significantly reduced.
proportion of untied grants dropped from 85%
under the Thirteenth Finance Commission (2010–15) to 60% under the Fifteenth Finance Commission (2021–26).
reduction limits the flexibility of panchayats
in addressing local issues, thereby weakening their decision-making power.
The Changing Nature of Welfare Delivery
Over the past decade,
India has witnessed a shift in welfare delivery mechanisms.
With the advent of digital financial systems like the
Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM)
platform, direct cash transfers have become
a preferred method for implementing welfare schemes.
While this approach enhances efficiency,
it sidelines PRIs, reducing their role in beneficiary selection and grievance redressal.
For instance, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (
PM-KISAN
) scheme provides direct cash transfers to farmers, bypassing local governance structures.
shift diminishes the accountability and engagement
that PRIs traditionally ensured in rural welfare programs.
The Impact of Urbanisation
India’s rapid urbanisation has also contributed to the declining relevance of PRIs.
In 1990, nearly 75% of India’s population lived in rural areas
; today, this figure has decreased to around
60% and continues to decline.
As a result,
policy priorities have increasingly shifted toward urban governance
and municipal reforms, relegating rural development to the background.
demographic change threatens to marginalise PRIs
, as attention and resources are increasingly directed toward cities and towns.
Ways to Revitalising Panchayati Raj
Strengthening Administrative and Fiscal Decentralisation
State governments
must commit to fully devolving administrative powers and resources
to PRIs.
includes granting panchayats greater control over local staff
and increasing the proportion of untied financial grants.
By doing so,
PRIs can regain their autonomy
and play a more proactive role in local decision-making.
Leveraging Technology for Citizen Engagement
integration of digital tools in governance
presents an opportunity to strengthen citizen participation in local decision-making.
By adopting digital platforms for planning, monitoring, and accountability,
PRIs can enhance transparency and efficiency
in service delivery.
networked panchayati raj system can also bridge the rural-urban divide
by facilitating better coordination between urban and rural development initiatives.
Reimagining the Role of Panchayats in Rural Development
PRIs can play a crucial role in addressing emerging challenges
such as water conservation, renewable energy generation, and disaster risk management.
leveraging scientific practices, traditional knowledge
, and public financing, panchayats
can contribute to sustainable development
Additionally,
they can support internal migration
by providing social security measures for migrant workers and their families.
Reviving Public Participation in Local Governance
Efforts must be made to rekindle public interest
and participation in the panchayati raj system.
Encouraging community involvement in decision-making,
conducting awareness campaigns, and ensuring that local governance remains transparent and accountable can help restore trust in PRIs.
Conclusion
The panchayati raj system was
envisioned as a means to bring democracy closer to the people and empower local communities.
systemic constraints
, financial dependency, and shifting governance priorities
have undermined its effectiveness.
To ensure that PRIs remain relevant and impactful,
India must adopt a renewed approach that prioritises administrative and fiscal decentralisation,
integrates technological advancements, and redefines the role of panchayats in rural development.
As 94 crore Indians still reside in villages,
revitalizing the panchayati raj system is not just a necessity but a fundamental step toward inclusive governance
and sustainable development.

**********Transforming India's Fruits & Vegetables Sector - Lessons from Dairy Success
Context:
India's fruits and vegetables (F&V) sector is
expanding faster than cereals
, contributing
nearly 30%
to crop agriculture. However, the sector needs to be redefined and transformed on the lines of the milk sector.
Issues Faced by F&V Sector in India:
Despite its nutritional and economic significance, F&V receives
less policy support
compared to cereals.
Lack of organized value chains, storage, and processing infrastructure
leads to seasonal gluts, price crashes, and post-harvest losses.
Post-harvest losses
amount to Rs 1.53 trillion annually, with 8.1% of fruits and 7.3% of vegetables lost.
Also, farmers receive only about 30% of the consumer price.
Replicating the Milk Revolution in F&V:
Success of the milk sector:
Led by
Verghese Kurien
, India transformed from a milk-deficient country to the
world’s largest producer
with 239 million tonnes in 2023-24.
Impact of dairy cooperatives:
AMUL ensures that farmers receive 75-80% of the consumer price.
F&V vs dairy sector:
Unlike dairy, F&V involves multiple commodities, seasonality, and regional concentration, making
price stabilization complex
Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) as a Solution:
Role of FPOs:
Integrating farmers into structured value chains can mitigate price volatility and post-harvest losses.
Case Study - Sahyadri Farmer Producer Company Ltd (SFPCL):
Founded in 2004 in Nashik, Maharashtra, with 10 farmers.
Expanded to 26,500 farmers across 252 villages and 31,000 acres.
Revenue surged from Rs 13 crore (2011-12) to Rs 1,549 crore (2023-24).
64.6% revenue from domestic markets, 35.4% from exports (41 countries).
Performance of SFPCL:
Export performance:
Dominated by grapes (63.9% of exports), followed by mango slices (18.2%) and banana (12.8%).
Processing infrastructure:
35% of domestic revenue from tomatoes processed into ketchup, puree, and sauces.
Employment generation:
Over 6,000 jobs, 32% being women employees.
Scaling Up the F&V Sector:
Government initiatives:
FPO development:
India has registered 8,875 out of a targeted 10,000 FPOs (as of August 2024) under the central sector scheme - Formation and Promotion of 10,000 FPOs.
Operation Greens (2018):
Launched to stabilize the supply of F&V in India, but with a modest Rs 500 crore allocation under the Ministry of Food Processing, it lacked both -
A visionary leader (like Kurien in Operation Flood) and
Clear accountability.
Key interventions needed:
Strengthening FPOs:
Providing working capital, infrastructure, and digital integration.
Market linkages:
Platforms like Open Network for Digital Commerce (
ONDC
) and blockchain for transparency.
Reviving and expanding:
Operation Greens and the
National Horticulture Mission.
Commodity-specific value chains:
Prioritizing processing of at least 10-20% of F&V produce to prevent distress sales.
Need for a National Fruit & Vegetable Board:
A centralized body
, similar to the National Dairy Development Board (
NDDB
), is essential to streamline market linkages, promote value chains, and integrate retailers like
SAFAL
is the largest organised retail network of F&V in the NCR, which is owned by Mother Dairy (a subsidiary of the NDDB).
Ensuring farmers receive 55-60% of the consumer price should be the goal.
Key question:
Can Vilas Shinde of Sahyadri Farms replicate Verghese Kurien’s dairy revolution for F&V?
Conclusion:
Sahyadri Farms could be the
divadandi
(lighthouse), as AMUL was in the milk sector.
Policy backing, infrastructure, and a visionary leader
are needed to drive growth.
Transforming F&V can
boost farmer incomes
, reduce post-harvest losses, and stabilize prices,
making India a global leader in horticulture

**********Weak Demand for sovereign green bonds
Why in news?
India has issued
to fund its low-carbon transition, but investor demand remains weak.
Despite their role in raising capital for clean energy, these bonds have struggled to secure a significant greenium (lower borrowing costs typically associated with such bonds) leading to funding cuts for key schemes like grid-scale solar.
With limited investor interest, India is relying on
general revenue
to fill the gaps. Enhancing liquidity, improving reporting transparency, and considering sustainability bonds could help boost demand and expand green finance.
What’s in today’s article?
Green Bonds
Muted Investor Demand for India's SGrBs
Impact of Weak SGrB Demand
Way Forward for India’s Sovereign Green Bonds
Sovereign Green Bonds (SGrBs) are issued by sovereign entities like the Government of India, which established a framework for their issuance in 2022.
These bonds fund
"green projects"
that promote energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, enhance climate resilience, and support natural ecosystems.
Issuance and Funds Raised
Since 2022-23, India has issued SGrBs eight times, raising nearly
Rs 53,000 crore
Around 50% of the proceeds are allocated annually to manufacturing energy-efficient
three-phase electric locomotives
under the Ministry of Railways.
2024-25 Revised Allocations to schemes eligible under SGrBs
Electric Locomotive Manufacturing – Rs 12,600 crore
Metro Projects – Rs 8,000 crore
Renewable Energy Projects (including National Green Hydrogen Mission) – Rs 4,607 crore
Afforestation (National Mission for a Green India) – Rs 124 crore
India's SGrB issues have faced weak investor interest, limiting the government's ability to secure a significant greenium (lower borrowing costs).
Despite easing rules for foreign investors, auctions have seen low participation, often requiring primary dealers to absorb unsold bonds.
Limited Greenium and Funding Challenges
Globally, greeniums reach
7-8 basis points
, but in India, they remain at just
2-3 basis points
This makes SGrBs a less attractive funding source, restricting their expansion.
Liquidity Constraints
Small issue sizes and investors holding bonds until maturity have stifled secondary market trading, reducing their appeal to new buyers.
Lack of Impact-Driven Investment Ecosystem
India lacks a
strong network of social impact funds and responsible investing mandates
, which in other markets drive demand for green bonds.
This further weakens investor enthusiasm for SGrBs.
The government’s struggle to raise sufficient funds from SGrBs affects financing for eligible schemes, increasing reliance on general revenue to cover shortfalls.
Revised Funding Estimates
Initial Requirement (2024-25): Rs 32,061 crore
Revised Estimate (after higher yield demands): Rs 25,298 crore
Grid-Scale Solar Allocation Cut: Reduced from Rs 10,000 crore to Rs 1,300 crore
Bridging the Shortfall
Expected SGrB Proceeds: Rs 21,697 crore
Amount Covered by General Revenue: Rs 3,600 crore
These funding challenges highlight the urgent need to boost investor demand for SGrBs to ensure the sustainability of green initiatives.
Exploring Sustainability Bonds
A World Bank report highlights that emerging markets issue more sustainability bonds—which finance both green and social projects—compared to advanced economies that focus solely on green bonds.
Introducing sustainability bonds could boost investor interest and increase proceeds.
Improving Post-Issuance Reporting
Delayed allocation and impact reports reduce investor confidence.
Investors rely on these reports to assess fund utilization and refine their data models.
However, India's 2023-24 allocation report is yet to be published, affecting transparency and trust.
Leveraging Multilateral Partnerships
India’s sovereign rating is not very high, which limits investor confidence.
Partnering with multilateral development banks to support its green bond strategy could enhance credibility and attract more investment.

**********[17th February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: The Panchayati Raj Movement is in Distress
Polity
PYQ Relevance:
) Assess the importance of the Panchayat system in India as a part of local government. Apart from government grants, what sources the Panchayats can look out for financing developmental projects?
(UPSC CSE 2018)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
the Panchayat System (2015),
and
Local Governance (2021).
The 73rd Amendment of 1992 was a milestone in India’s democracy, establishing the Panchayati Raj system to decentralize governance. It created a three-tier structure at the village, block, and district levels, ensuring regular local elections and reserving 50% of seats for women, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes. This brought democracy to the grassroots, promoting local representation and inclusive leadership. However, progress in strengthening local governance has slowed. Rapid technological and societal changes now risk making Panchayats less relevant. To keep them effective, their role must be reimagined to address modern challenges while preserving their core democratic purpose.
Today’s editorial talks about issues related to local government. This content would help in GS Paper 2 in mains answer writing.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
The special discussion in Parliament on the
75th anniversary of the Indian Constitution
had several salient aspects of the Constitution and policy directions adopted by previous governments but very little on a
vital aspect of local governance
was highlighted.
Why is the Panchayati Raj movement facing distress?
Incomplete Devolution of Powers:
Many States have not transferred all 29 subjects under the Eleventh Schedule, limiting Panchayats’ decision-making authority.
Example:
A 2022 Ministry of Panchayati Raj report found that less than 20% of States had fully devolved powers, restricting local governance.
Declining Fiscal Autonomy:
Though direct transfers have increased, untied grants (which Panchayats can use freely) have reduced from 85% (13th Finance Commission) to 60% (15th Finance Commission).
Many Gram Panchayats rely on centrally sponsored schemes, leaving little room for independent development planning.
Marginalization Due to Digital Welfare Schemes:
Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes like
PM-KISAN
bypass Panchayats, reducing their role in beneficiary selection and grievance redress.
Farmers receive ₹6,000 annually under PM-KISAN directly in their accounts, eliminating Panchayats’ role in rural welfare.
Political and Bureaucratic Interference:
State governments and political parties use Panchayats as tools for electoral gains rather than empowering them as self-governing institutions.
In states like
West Bengal and Kerala
, Panchayat elections are highly politicized, often leading to violence and reducing focus on governance.
Impact of Urbanization:
With India’s rural population declining (from ~75% in 1990 to ~60% today), policy focus has shifted towards urban development and municipal governance.
Rural development funds have increasingly been diverted towards urban infrastructure projects, weakening Panchayat-led rural initiatives.
What impact does the distress in Panchayati Raj have on rural development?
Inefficiency in Rural Welfare Implementation:
Panchayats have been sidelined in the distribution of welfare benefits, leading to inefficiencies and reduced grievance redressal.
Schemes like
PM Awas Yojana
bypass Panchayats, causing delays in identifying genuine beneficiaries and addressing local concerns.
Neglect of Rural Infrastructure and Public Services:
Panchayats’ inability to raise resources has led to poor maintenance of rural roads, sanitation, and drinking water supply.
Many village schools and health centres remain understaffed due to a lack of funds and decision-making power at the Panchayat level.
Increased Rural-Urban Migration:
The failure to create employment and sustainable livelihoods in villages forces rural youth to migrate to cities for work.
States like
Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
witness high rural-to-urban migration as Panchayats are unable to promote local skill development and job creation.
Weakened Local Decision-Making and Planning:
Panchayats struggle to implement need-based development projects due to limited autonomy and lack of funds.
In many states, Gram Panchayats cannot initiate independent infrastructure projects like rural roads or drinking water facilities without state approval.
Reduced Grassroots Participation in Governance:
Declining public engagement weakens democratic processes, reducing local accountability and effective implementation of schemes.
Many village-level meetings (Gram Sabhas) see low attendance, leading to top-down decision-making that may not reflect local priorities.
What steps can be taken to revive and strengthen the Panchayati Raj system?
Greater Devolution of Powers and Functions:
State governments should fully implement the
by transferring all 29 subjects to Panchayats.
Kerala’s
People’s Plan Campaign
empowered Panchayats with financial and planning autonomy, leading to better local governance.
Enhancing Financial Autonomy:
from Finance Commissions to Panchayats and allow them to generate local revenue through taxes and fees.
Maharashtra has successfully implemented
property tax collection
at the Gram Panchayat level to fund local development.
Strengthening Administrative Capacity:
Appoint dedicated
local-level bureaucrats
and improve digital governance tools for efficient service delivery.
Karnataka’s
Gram Swaraj Project
uses IT-based platforms to improve transparency and monitoring of Panchayat activities.
Encouraging Citizen Participation and Accountability:
Regular and
active Gram Sabha meetings
should be mandated for community involvement in decision-making.
In Rajasthan,
social audits
of MGNREGA work through Gram Sabhas have improved transparency and reduced corruption.
Expanding Panchayats’ Role in Emerging Areas:
Panchayats should be given new responsibilities in areas like
water conservation, renewable energy, and disaster management. Example:
Gujarat’s
Mission Mangalam
engaged Panchayats in women-led SHGs to promote local entrepreneurship and sustainable rural development.
Way forward:
Comprehensive Devolution and Strengthening Autonomy
– Ensure full transfer of subjects under the Eleventh Schedule, increase untied grants, and empower Panchayats with independent revenue-generating mechanisms to enhance self-governance.
Capacity Building and Community Engagement
– Improve Panchayat administration through digital tools, dedicated local bureaucrats, and mandated Gram Sabha participation to enhance transparency, accountability, and grassroots governance.
**********When can President’s Rule be imposed?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
President Rule;
Why in the News?
After Manipur CM N. Biren Singh resigned, President’s Rule was imposed on February 13 due to ethnic violence and the BJP’s failure to find a consensus CM candidate.
What is the President’s Rule?
President’s Rule, also known as Governor’s Rule, is the suspension of a state government and imposition of direct rule by the central government. It is invoked when the constitutional machinery in a State has failed, making it impossible for the State government to function according to constitutional provisions.
It is a mechanism to uphold the constitutional order, ensure continuity of governance, and protect the interests of citizens when a State government is unable to function according to the constitutional framework. The President’s Rule is also known as ‘Constitutional Emergency’ or ‘State Emergency’.
Constitutional Provisions
Article 356:
According to Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, the President can declare President’s Rule in a state if they are satisfied that the government of that State cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution. The President can act based on a report from the State’s Governor or even without such a report.
Article 365:
According to Article 365 of the Indian Constitution, the President may invoke President’s Rule if a State fails to comply with or give effect to directions from the Union government.
What are some previous instances of the imposition of President’s Rule?
First Instance (1951 – Punjab)
: The first-ever imposition of
was in
Punjab (PEPSU state)
in 1951 due to the collapse of the Gopi Chand Bhargava-led government.
1967 Political Crisis (Multiple States)
: After the
Fourth General Elections
, many states had unstable coalition governments. President’s Rule was imposed in states like
West Bengal, Kerala, and Uttar Pradesh
due to political instability.
1984 – Punjab (After Indira Gandhi’s Assassination)
: Following the assassination of
, there were widespread
riots and breakdown of law and order
in Punjab. The state was placed under
President’s Rule from 1983 to 1985
to handle the crisis.
1992 – Dismissal of BJP Governments (Post-Babri Masjid Demolition)
demolition of Babri Masjid
in December 1992, President’s Rule was imposed in
Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh
, where BJP-led governments were in power.
2016 – Uttarakhand & Arunachal Pradesh (Judicial Review Cases)
: President’s Rule was controversially imposed in
Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh
due to political instability, but the Supreme Court later
revoked it
, citing unconstitutional use of Article 356.
Why has it become less frequent?
Judicial Review & Bommai Judgment (1994)
– The
S.R. Bommai vs Union of India
case allowed
judicial review of President’s Rule
, enabling courts to
strike down unconstitutional proclamations
, deterring its misuse.
Example: Arunachal Pradesh (2016)
– President’s Rule was imposed, citing a breakdown of constitutional machinery. The
Supreme Court overturned the decision
, ruling that the Governor’s actions were unconstitutional and reinstating the Congress-led government.
Stricter Conditions for Extension
– After
one year of President’s Rule
, extensions require
either a national emergency or the Election Commission’s certification
that elections cannot be held, making prolonged Central rule difficult.
For example, The
Supreme Court’s judgment in the S.R. Bommai vs Union of India (1994)
case established stricter conditions for extending
President’s Rule beyond one year
Political & Legal Accountability
– Increased
coalition politics and judicial interventions
have made it harder for the Union government to arbitrarily impose President’s Rule, ensuring greater
stability and democratic governance
in States.
Example: Uttarakhand (2016)
– The Congress-led government faced internal rebellion, leading to the imposition of the
High Court and Supreme Court struck it down
, restoring the elected government.
What does it mean to keep a legislature in suspended animation?
Temporary Suspension Without Dissolution
– Keeping the legislature in suspended animation means that the state assembly is
temporarily inactive but not dissolved
during President’s Rule. This allows the possibility of reinstating the assembly if political stability is restored.
Manipur (2025)
, the state assembly was kept in suspended animation after the imposition of President’s Rule, instead of being dissolved.
Governor Takes Over Legislative Functions
– The powers of the legislature are transferred to the
during this period, effectively sidelining the elected representatives.
, the assembly was suspended, and the Governor was entrusted with the state’s administrative powers after the imposition of President’s Rule.
Potential for Revival
– The assembly can be
revived if conditions improve
and a popular government can be formed, allowing the political process to resume once the President’s Rule is revoked.
Jammu and Kashmir (2018-2019)
, the state assembly remained in suspended animation after the imposition of President’s Rule, waiting for a stable political situation before elections could take place.
Way forward:
Strengthening Federal Governance
– To prevent the misuse of President’s Rule, it is essential to promote a more robust system of checks and balances, ensuring that any imposition of President’s Rule is transparent and justified, with clear guidelines for intervention.
Reform of Political Stability Mechanisms
– Encouraging political parties to form more stable coalitions and ensuring timely elections through institutional mechanisms will reduce the need for prolonged central intervention, preserving the autonomy of states while maintaining national integrity.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Researchers have discovered a
significant pause in
coral reef
growth
Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba
during the
late Holocene period
.
Key Highlights of the Study:
The study identified a
4,400 – 1,000-year hiatus in coral growth
, similar to events observed in
Mexico, Brazil, and Australia
Scientists attribute this
temporary halt
to a
sea-level drop caused by tectonic activity and cooling events
, which
exposed coral reefs
and disrupted their development.
Despite this, the reef
recovered by recolonizing from deeper coral communities
, showcasing
its natural resilience
About Gulf of Eilat
Also known as the
Gulf of Aqaba
, it is a
narrow extension of the Red Sea
, located between the
Sinai Peninsula (Egypt) and the Arabian Peninsula

**********What is the Cancer Vaccine Russia is offering?
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
mRNA (Messenger RNA)
Why in the News?
In December 2024, Russia announced the development of a
new mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccine
, with plans to make it available
for free to patients by early 2025
.
What is mRNA (Messenger RNA)?
mRNA is a type of RNA that
transports genetic information from DNA to ribosomes
, guiding the production of proteins.
It
tells the cell which proteins to make
by providing the exact sequence of amino acids.
Unlike DNA, mRNA
does not stay in the cell permanently
; it gets
degraded after protein synthesis
mRNA-based vaccines (like
COVID-19 vaccines
) teach cells to
produce harmless viral proteins
, triggering an immune response.
What is an mRNA Cancer Vaccine?
Unlike traditional vaccines,
mRNA vaccines provide genetic instructions
to train the immune system to detect and attack cancer cells.
This technology gained prominence with the
COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna)
and is now being adapted for
cancer treatment
These vaccines are
therapeutic
, designed for
patients who already have cancer
, not for prevention.
How do mRNA Cancer Vaccines Work?
Cancer cells evade the immune system by suppressing immune responses
Immunotherapy works by
enhancing the body’s natural ability to detect and destroy these cancerous cells
Unlike chemotherapy, which kills both healthy and cancerous cells, immunotherapy selectively targets only cancer cells
, reducing
harmful side effects
mRNA cancer vaccines are
customized for each patient
, targeting
specific tumor antigens
, making them
highly personalized and potentially more effective
While traditional
infectious disease vaccines prevent illness
, mRNA cancer vaccines are
, meaning they are
administered to patients who already have cancer
to help their immune system fight the disease.
