PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS (POPs)
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
Scientists conducted a 10-year study on orcas in the North Atlantic Ocean. Despite these orcas living far from human settlements, researchers found high levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in their blubber (the fat layer under their skin).
One of the POPs found were polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Used as coolants and lubricants in electrical components, they were banned in the US and Canada 50 years ago. The blubber samples also contained several other categories of POPs, whose “production, use, and/or release” were to be reduced or eliminated under Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, signed in 2001.
Key takeaways
Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are a group of toxic chemicals that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes.
Characteristics:
Persistence: POPs remain in the environment for extended periods without breaking down.
Bioaccumulation: These pollutants accumulate in the fatty tissues of living organisms.
Lipophilicity: POPs are highly soluble in fats and oils, leading to their accumulation in the food chain.
Toxicity: They are toxic to both humans and wildlife, causing adverse health effects.
Long-range Transport: Can be carried by wind and water to regions far from their source.
Sources:
Pesticides: Many POPs are pesticides or insecticides, such as DDT and aldrin.
Industrial Chemicals: Some POPs are industrial chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
Unintentional By-products: POPs can also be unintentional by-products of waste burning and industrial processes, such as dioxins and furans.
International Regulation:
Stockholm Convention: The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is a global treaty aimed at eliminating or restricting the production and use of POPs. It was adopted in 2001 and became effective in 2004.
India is a signatory and has ratified the convention.
Control Measures: The convention includes measures to prohibit or restrict the production, use, and release of POPs, as well as to ensure their safe disposal.
Examples of POPs:
The Dirty Dozen: The initial list of POPs identified by the Stockholm Convention includes aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, toxaphene, PCBs, DDT, dioxins, and furans.
New Additions: Over time, additional POPs have been added to the list, such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).

SANTA ANA WINDS
Fire crews continue to battle a wildfire in the wealthy coastal town of Malibu, California. Although the cause of the fire is yet to be determined, experts suggest that the fire has been destructive because of two reasons, the “Santa Ana” winds and climate change.
The wildfire has charred more than 4,000 acres and affected about 22,000 people.
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-200460" decoding="async" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/18-decc-298x300.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/18-decc-298x300.png 298w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/18-decc-150x150.png 150w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/18-decc.png 600w" width="298"/>
Santa Ana winds blow when high pressure builds over the Great Basin — the area between the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada (a mountain range in the Western United States) — and the pressure is low over California’s coast.
The difference in pressure triggers the movement of powerful winds from the Basin’s inland deserts, east and north of Southern California, over the mountains toward the Pacific Ocean.
As the wind comes down the mountains, it compresses and heats up. The wind’s
humidity also drops, sometimes to less than 20% or even less than 10%. The extremely low moisture turns vegetation dry, making it ready to burn. This process helped fuel the flames in Malibu.
Santa Ana winds usually occur from October to January.

INLAND WATERWAYS IN INDIA
Mains – GS 3
The government unveiled a major policy for cargo promotion, ‘Jalvahak’, to boost long-haul cargo movement via inland waterways across National Waterways (NW) on rivers Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Barak.
India has about 14500 kilometres of navigable waterways. Despite this, Inland waterways remain underutilized at a share of 2% in India’s modal mix, compared to 35% in Bangladesh.
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-200463" decoding="async" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/18-deccc-1-284x300.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/18-deccc-1-284x300.png 284w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/18-deccc-1.png 335w" width="284"/>
Inland Waterways:
They are navigable water bodies located within the boundaries of a country, typically away from coastal areas.
The National Waterways Act of 2016, has identified 111 navigable water courses and declared them “national inland waterways”.
Significance/advantages of Inland Waterways in India:
It reduces transport costs as it is reported to be 60% cheaper than road transport and 20-30% cheaper than rail.
According to the findings of the Integrated National Waterways Transportation Grid Study, one litre of fuel will move 24 tons through 1km on the road, 85km on the rail, and 105 km on inland water transport. So inland waterways are a fuel and energy-efficient medium of transportation as compared to the other modes of transport like rail and road.
It is an environment-friendly mode of transport as it emits 10 times less carbon dioxide per ton-kilometer compared to road transport, contributing to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
It does not require extensive land acquisition like that of road and rail projects.
It helps in employment generation as the development of inland waterways creates jobs in various sectors such as river conservancy, vessel operation, terminal management, and tourism.
It helps in creating seamless interconnectivity connecting hinterlands along navigable river coasts and coastal routes.
It is likely to play a crucial role in connecting the northeastern states to the mainland.
It enhances tourism development through initiatives like river cruises which help to promote cultural and heritage tourism along riverbanks.
Issues/Challenges related to Inland Waterways in India:
Indian rivers do not have adequate depth and northern rivers suffer from high siltation which extensive dredging a necessity.
The operational efficiency is affected due to the shortage of modern terminals and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities for vessels.
There have been concerns regarding environmental pollution caused due to dredging activities necessary for maintaining navigability.
The safe navigation at night is hampered due to the lack of Night Navigation Facilities such as Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS).
The passage of bigger vessels may get obstructed due to low vertical clearances from bridges.
It is often burdened by regulatory complexities and overlapping jurisdictions among various government agencies.
Both public and private funding in the sector is low but dredging as well as infrastructure for IWT requires huge investments.

**********In Today’s India, Can the Constitution Protect Individual Dignity?
Context
The parliamentary debate on the Constitution often descends into a partisan contest
between political parties, with each accusing the other of undermining constitutional values.
While such debates ostensibly reflect democratic accountability,
they often fail to inspire confidence in the preservation of these values.
Amid these debates,
it is important to explore the core principles of modern Indian constitution, its challenges and paradoxes, and the future actions
to navigate these challenges and paradoxes.
Core Principles of Modern Constitutionalism
Protection of Individual Rights
The cornerstone of constitutionalism is the
safeguarding of individual freedoms and dignity.
Constitution enshrines fundamental rights that ensure every citizen's freedom of speech, expression, religion,
and association, among others.
These
rights serve as a bulwark against oppression and discrimination,
empowering individuals to lead lives of autonomy and self-respect.
framers of modern constitutions understood that preserving these freedoms was essential
to human dignity and societal progress.
Equality Before the Law
Political and legal equality are central
tenets
of constitutionalism.
principle of equality ensures that all citizens, regardless of caste, creed, gender, or economic status, are entitled to equal protection
under the law.
This
equality is fundamental to developing an inclusive society
where every individual can participate in public life without fear of prejudice or exclusion.
Checks and Balances
Constitutionalism emphasises the separation of powers
among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.
division ensures that no single entity wields unchecked authority,
creating a system of mutual oversight.
Institutional checks and balances are designed to prevent the concentration of power,
promoting accountability and transparency in governance.
Limitation of Government Power
Another core principle is the
formal limitation of government authority through clearly defined laws and procedures.
Constitutional frameworks describe the scope of government functions,
ensuring that power is exercised within the bounds of legality and reason.
limitations are vital to preventing authoritarianism
and preserving the democratic ethos.
Promotion of Political Agency
Modern constitutionalism
envisions a society where citizens actively participate in shaping their collective destiny.
By guaranteeing universal suffrage and free elections, the Constitution empowers individuals to act as political agents
with the ability to influence governance.
Political agency is further reinforced through mechanisms for public accountability,
such as free speech and a free press, enabling citizens to challenge decisions that affect their lives.
Commitment to Democracy
At its heart,
constitutionalism is a commitment to democratic governance
, where collective decisions are made through deliberation and consent.
The Constitution establishes the rules and processes through which representatives are chosen,
laws are enacted, and disputes are resolved.
commitment ensures that governance remains responsive to the will of the people
while respecting the rule of law.
Inclusion and Justice
While modern constitutions abstract away from specific social forms
, they often incorporate provisions for justice and inclusion.
For instance,
the Indian Constitution acknowledges the historical injustices faced by marginalised communities
and provides mechanisms for affirmative action.
This balance between universal principles and targeted interventions underscores the Constitution’s commitment
to fairness and equity.
Creating Collective Decision-Making
emphasises the importance of political justification in public decision-making.
It
requires that decisions affecting common life be subjected to public reasoning
and scrutiny, ensuring legitimacy and fairness.
principle reinforces the idea of governance as a collective endeavour
rather than a unilateral imposition.
Challenges to Constitutional Ideals
Tension Between Individual Rights and Group Rights
A central challenge in constitutional democracies is
reconciling individual freedoms with the recognition and accommodation of group identities.
Indian Constitution exemplifies this tension by granting fundamental rights to individuals while also acknowledging the historical injustices
faced by specific communities, particularly marginalised caste groups
Measures like caste-based reservations aim to promote social justice but have also sparked debates about fairness
, meritocracy, and the perpetuation of identity-based politics.
These policies, while necessary for inclusion, sometimes conflict with the constitutional ideal of equality,
raising concerns about creating new forms of exclusion.
Entrenchment of Identity-Based Politics
aspires to liberate individuals from fixed ascriptive identities, enabling them to act as autonomous political agents
However,
in practice, political systems often exploit identity-based divisions
for electoral gains.
Indian Constitution envisions a society free from permanent majorities or minorities.
Yet,
identity politics has entrenched divisions along religious, caste, and regional lines,
with majority groups asserting dominance and minority groups demanding constitutional recognition as distinct social forces.
Subversion of Checks and Balances
principle of institutional checks and balances is crucial
to preventing the concentration of power. However, in practice, these safeguards are often undermined.
Both at the central and state levels, governments have frequently attempted to consolidate power
, sidelining the legislature and judiciary.
erosion of institutional autonomy weakens the accountability mechanisms
envisioned by the Constitution.
the judiciary is a vital guardian of constitutional values, instances of judicial overreach, where courts venture into policy-making, blur the separation of powers.
This trend, while well-intentioned, risks undermining democratic processes.
The Puzzle of Constitutional Permanence
critical paradox of constitutionalism lies in its relationship with time.
Basic Structure Doctrine,
which asserts the inviolability of certain constitutional principles,
effectively arrests the Constitution in a quasi-eternal framework.
While this doctrine safeguards core values,
it also raises questions about whether the Constitution becomes a matter of mere invocation rather than genuine adherence.
Basic Structure, like a secular Sanatan Dharma, acts as an immutable truth,
yet its practical significance depends on the sincerity with which political actors uphold it.
Historically,
constitutions represented real social power
, serving as mechanisms to channel and balance competing forces.
In contrast, modern constitutions, including India’s, operate as legal constructs detached from fixed social forms.
abstraction is both a strength and a challenge: it allows for adaptability but also risks alienation
from the societal realities it seeks to govern.
Way Forward: Navigating the Future of Constitutionalism
The survival of constitutional democracy
depends on addressing these paradoxes.
Constitution must continue to function as a framework for individual freedom and collective governance,
resisting the pull of ascriptive identities and permanent majorities.
This requires vigilance against the forces that subvert constitutional ideals
, whether through executive overreach, identity-based discrimination, or economic inequalities.
Conclusion
The Indian Constitution is a remarkable testament to the vision of its framers,
who sought to create a framework that transcends partisan interests and ascriptive identities.
However, its enduring relevance depends on the collective commitment to uphold its principles
in the face of evolving societal challenges.
By addressing the paradoxes of modern constitutionalism,
between abstract ideals and practical realities, between permanence and adaptability,
India can ensure that its Constitution remains a living document, safeguarding freedom, equality, and dignity for all.

Editorial Analysis
**********Arctic Tundra as a Carbon Source
The Arctic Tundra has transitioned from a carbon sink to a carbon emitter as confirmed by a new analysis in the ‘Arctic Report Card’ by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
About Arctic Tundra:
is a vast,
treeless biome
characterized by its cold, dry, and rocky terrain.
The term “tundra” originates from the
Finnish word tunturi
, meaning a
‘treeless plain.’
Characteristics of the Arctic Tundra:
Permafrost
: It refers to permanently frozen soil, starting within a meter of the surface. During
summer
, only the upper layer thaws, while deeper layers remain frozen.
The frozen layer restricts plant root growth and prevents
tree growth
, resulting in a treeless landscape.
Soil composition
: The tundra's soil is
and nutrient-poor due to low decomposition rates.
Organic material accumulates in the form of
peat (decayed sphagnum moss)
humus (organic matter)
, making it a significant
Geographic location
: The Arctic tundra is the
northernmost biome
, covering areas north of the Arctic Circle up to the
polar ice cap
, parts of Canada, Iceland, and Greenland.
It spans approximately
5 million km²
Climate
: Temperatures range from
5°C in summer to -60°C in winter
, with mean temperatures below
0°C for 6–10 months
Annual precipitation
is low, ranging between
150–250 mm
, but evaporation is minimal.
Features
24-hour sunlight in summer
24-hour darkness in winter
Natural vegetation
: Vegetation is predominantly
herbaceous
due to the cold climate and short growing season.Includes grasses, mosses (e.g., reindeer moss), lichens, and liverworts.
Woody plants like
dwarf willows
remain short and spread to withstand high winds.
Animal life
: Large mammals such as
polar bears, caribou, musk ox, and Arctic foxes
inhabit the tundra.
Smaller animals like
lemmings and Arctic hares
adapt with fur that changes color seasonally.
Migratory birds, such as
loons and snow geese
, breed in the tundra during summer.
Arctic Tundra as a Carbon Sink:
Despite the absence of trees, the Arctic Tundra is a
significant carbon sink
This is due to the
accumulation of organic matter
in:
Peat
(Decayed
sphagnum moss) and Humus
(Decomposed organic material).
The cold conditions slow decomposition, trapping carbon in the
permafrost
for millennia.
Reasons for Emissions

**********Short neck clam
Recently, three million seeds of short neck clam (Paphia malabarica), produced at the Vizhinjam Regional Centre of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) were released into Ashtamudi Lake.
About Short neck clam:
The economically valuable
bivalve mollusc, known as the short-neck clam
, is the major fishery resource of the brackishwater Ashtamudi Lake in Kerala.
It is a fast-growing species with a peak
spawning season of December to February
and has a maximum lifespan of around 3 years.
It attains sexual maturity in its first year at a shell length of 30 mm.
It is India’s first
Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified fisheries.
The shells provide an extra income
as a mineral source
used in
cement production
and to make carbide for use in
welding
The clam shell also holds
commercial importance
being the raw material for the manufacture of
calcium carbide and sand lime bricks
They are also used for
lime burning for construction, in paddy field and fish farms
for neutralizing acid soil and as slaked lime.
The clams are bought by a local factory, heat-treated, frozen and sold on to retailers and restaurants, with around 80% being
exported to Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand.
In recent years, the fishery of this
clam has witnessed a drastic decline
, threatening the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen who rely on this resource.
Reasons for its decline
are e
nvironmental pollution, invasion of non-native species like the
Charru mussel
, and the impacts of climate change, including altered salinity and water temperature,etc.

**********The Introduction of 'One Nation, One Election' Bills and Parliamentary Procedures
Why in news?
The government introduced two Bills on “One Nation, One Election” in Lok Sabha amid strong objections from the Opposition INDIA bloc.
Voting during the introduction saw 269 members in favor and 198 opposing the Bills.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal assured the House that the Bills would be referred to a joint parliamentary committee for detailed examination.
What’s in today’s article?
History of elections in India
The introduction of bills and Opposition's Concerns
Clarification on Voting Rules
Procedure under Article 368
The concept of "
" envisions a system in which all state and Lok Sabha elections must be held simultaneously.
This will entail restructuring the Indian election cycle so that elections to the states and the centre coincide.
This would imply that
voters will vote for members of the LS and state assemblies on the same day and at the same time
(or in a phased manner as the case may be).
History of Elections in India
Era of simultaneous elections
The first general elections of free India held simultaneously to the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies of the States in 1951.
next three cycles of elections
also witnessed concurrent Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly elections barring a few stray cases like:
Kerala where a mid-term election was held in 1960 on the pre-mature dissolution of the Assembly, and
in Nagaland and Pondicherry where the Assembly was created only after the 1962 general elections.
The last occasion when we had
near-simultaneous elections was in 1967
Beginning of the end of simultaneous elections
The fourth Lok Sabha constituted in 1967 was dissolved prematurely in 1971. This was the beginning of the end of simultaneous elections.
Extension of the term of Lok Sabha during the National Emergency declared in 1975 and the dissolution of Assemblies of some States after the 1977 Lok Sabha election further disturbed the cycle of concurrent elections.
Current status
After the two pre-mature dissolutions of the Lok Sabha in 1998 and 1999,
only four State Assemblies have been going to polls along with the Lok Sabha elections in the last two decades
We now have
at least two rounds of Assembly general elections every year
Several Opposition MPs had given notices opposing the introduction of the Bills.
Clauses 72(1) and 72(2) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business
in the Lok Sabha allow any member to give prior notices opposing the introduction of a Bill.
Main opposition leaders have criticized the Bills, calling them a violation of the federal structure.
They questioned
why state governments should fall if the central government falls
They also claimed that the ruling government lacked the two-thirds majority required to pass a constitutional amendment.
Hence, the Opposition MPs declared the introduction a procedural victory for them.
Introduction Stage
A special majority is not required to introduce a Constitution Amendment Bill or refer it to a Select/Joint Committee.
A simple majority suffices at this stage, as per parliamentary rules.
Subsequent Stages
A special majority is mandatory only during later stages of the Bill, such as:
Consideration of the Bill
Final Passage of the Bill
What Does Article 368 Say?
Article 368 of the Constitution specifies:
An amendment Bill requires two-thirds majority of members present and voting and a majority of the total membership of the House to pass.
After passing both Houses, it must receive Presidential assent to become law.
Procedure for Constitution Amendment Bills
Rule 157
of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha: Process for Constitution Amendment Bills
For motions
like considering the Bill, taking the Select or Joint Committee’s report into consideration, or passing the Bill (with or without amendments), the motion is deemed carried if:
A majority of the total membership of the House supports it, and
At least two-thirds of the members present and voting are in favor.
Rule 158: Voting by Division
Division voting is required when a motion needs both:
A majority of the total membership of the House, and
A two-thirds majority of the members present and voting.

**********Simultaneous Elections Bills Tabled in Lok Sabha, Referred to Parliamentary Committee
Why in news?
The government introduced two Bills in the Lok Sabha to enable simultaneous elections: The Constitution (
129th Amendment
) Bill and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill.
Constitution Amendment Bill aims to synchronize the terms of the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies. On the other hand, the Consequential Amendment Bill aims to amend relevant laws for Union Territories and Delhi to facilitate simultaneous polls.
These bills were passed for introduction with 269 votes in favor and 198 against. The bill will now be sent to the Joint Parliamentary Committee.
A high-level committee chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind had earlier recommended simultaneous elections.
What’s in today’s article?
Key Takeaways from the Bills
Proposed Amendments in the One Nation, One Election Bills
Proposed Amendments to Lok Sabha’s Term and Dissolution
Proposed Amendments for State Assemblies
The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024
Scope of Simultaneous Polls
Applies only to Parliament and state Assemblies, excluding municipal corporations.
Timeline for Implementation
Realistically,
simultaneous polls may begin with the 2034 election cycle
, assuming the 18th and 19th Lok Sabhas complete full five-year terms.
The President will issue a notification on the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after the general election to implement the amendments.
Mid-term Election Provisions
The Bills include provisions for situations where mid-term elections might be required at the state or central level.
Exclusion of Municipal Elections
Municipal elections are excluded to avoid the need for ratification by at least half of the state legislatures, a more complex process.
Alignment with High-Level Committee Recommendations
The amendments are based on recommendations by the High-Level Committee on One Nation, One Election.
The committee was chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind and submitted its report in March 2024.
Key Features of the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill, 2024
Amendments and New Article
Amendment of Three Articles
: The Bill proposes changes to three existing articles of the Constitution.
It amends
Articles 83
(duration of Houses of Parliament),
172
(duration of state legislatures), and
327
(power of Parliament to make provisions with respect to elections to Legislatures).
Insertion of Article 82A
: A new provision (Article 82A, clauses 1-6) is introduced to enable simultaneous elections. This article is placed after Article 82, which pertains to delimitation.
Provisions of Article 82A
Timeline for Implementation - 82A (1)
The President can notify the appointed date for the changes after the first sitting of the Lok Sabha following a general election.
Curtailed Tenures for State Assemblies - 82A (2)
Assemblies elected after the appointed date but before the Lok Sabha’s term ends will have their terms curtailed to align with the Lok Sabha’s full five-year term.
Election Commission’s Role in Conducting Simultaneous Elections - 82A (3)
The Election Commission of India (ECI) is tasked with conducting general elections for the Lok Sabha and all Legislative Assemblies simultaneously.
Definition of Simultaneous Elections - 82A (4)
Simultaneous elections are defined as “general elections held for constituting the House of the People and all the Legislative Assemblies together.”
Exception Clause for Assembly Elections - 82A (5)
The ECI may recommend postponing a particular Assembly election if it determines simultaneous elections are not feasible.
The President can then issue an order for those elections to be conducted separately.
Alignment of Deferred Elections - 82A (6)
If an Assembly election is deferred, the term of that Assembly will still end with the full term of the Lok Sabha elected in the general election.
Changes to Article 83: Lok Sabha’s Term Adjustment
Fixed Term with Flexibility
: Article 83 prescribes a fixed five-year term for Lok Sabha unless dissolved earlier.
New Clauses for Unexpired Terms
: If Lok Sabha is dissolved before completing its full term, the next Lok Sabha will only serve the unexpired period of the original term.
Example: If Lok Sabha is dissolved after 3 years and 2 months, the subsequent Lok Sabha will serve the remaining 22 months.
Clarification on New House
The new Lok Sabha formed after a mid-term election will not be a continuation of the dissolved House.
Pending Bills in the dissolved House will expire, as they do after a full term.
Amendments to Article 327: Enabling Simultaneous Elections
Article 327 gives Parliament the authority to legislate on matters related to elections, including electoral rolls and delimitation of constituencies.
The amendment proposes adding “conduct of simultaneous elections” to this list.
This ensures Parliament can make provisions to align elections for both Houses of Parliament and State Legislatures.
Proposed Amendments for State Assemblies - Changes to Article 172 (Duration of State Legislatures)
Similar to Lok Sabha, state Assemblies’ terms will also align with the “unexpired term” provision.
If a state Assembly is dissolved before its full term, elections will be conducted for the remaining term of the dissolved Assembly.
Purpose of the Bill
- Align Union Territories with the framework for simultaneous elections.
This is because Union Territories are governed under a separate constitutional scheme that is different from states.
Government of Union Territories Act, 1963
: Adjustments to enable synchronized elections in Union Territories.
Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991
: Similar changes for Delhi.
Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019
: Amendments to include Jammu and Kashmir within the simultaneous election framework.

**********Minority Rights in India
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
About Minorities (Constitutional Provisions, Definition of Minority, Judicial Safeguards, Rationale, Significance, etc.)
Introduction:
Minority rights are a cornerstone of democratic governance, ensuring the preservation of cultural, linguistic, and religious diversity.
Recognizing this, the Indian Constitution and international frameworks like the United Nations' 1992 Declaration on Minority Rights aim to protect minority communities.
Franklin Roosevelt aptly noted, "
No democracy can long survive which does not accept as fundamental to its very existence the recognition of the rights of minorities
.”
Historical Context:
The concept of minority rights traces its origins to 19th-century European constitutional frameworks:
Austria (1867)
: Recognized ethnic minorities' rights to preserve their languages and national identities.
Hungary (1868)
: Legislated similar protections.
Post-World War I Treaties
: Incorporated minority protection clauses in agreements with nations like
Poland
Czechoslovakia
India incorporated these principles during its Constitution drafting process, emphasizing the preservation of diversity.
Provisions in the Indian Constitution:
Article 29
: Grants all citizens the right to conserve their distinct culture, language, or script.
: Recognizes and protects diverse cultural identities, ensuring equality and dignity.
Article 30
: Empowers religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.
Judicial Interpretation
The Supreme Court views Article 30 as integral to equality and non-discrimination.
Recent judgments (e.g., Aligarh Muslim University, 2024) uphold the minority character of institutions of national importance.
Article 350 A
: Mandates primary education in one's mother tongue.
Article 350 B
: Provides for appointing a Special Officer for linguistic minorities.
The Constitution also supports personal laws for various communities, exemplified by the customary laws of the Nagas.
Defining ‘Minority’:
The term "minority" lacks a universal definition in the Constitution. However:
: The Supreme Court, in cases like TMA Pai Foundation (2002), defines minorities at the state level. For example, Hindus are considered minorities in Punjab and north-eastern states.
Indicia for Minority Institutions
Originator’s intent to serve minority communities.
Operational factors like funding, infrastructure, and administration.
Judicial Safeguards:
While minority institutions enjoy autonomy, they are not exempt from oversight:
Maladministration Prohibition
: Governments can enforce regulations to maintain institutional standards.
Fair Aid
: Article 30(2) prohibits discrimination against minority institutions when granting aid.
Rationale Behind Minority Rights:
The preservation of diversity underpins these rights. Cultural identity thrives not in isolation but within an enabling environment. Thus:
Individual vs. Group Rights
: Individual equality (Articles 14-18, 19, 25) is insufficient without group recognition.
Judicial Observations
: Courts consistently emphasize the necessity of special protections for minorities to achieve substantive equality.
Significance in Contemporary India:
Constitutional Legacy
: Articles 25-30 symbolize India's commitment to pluralism.
Global Relevance
: Aligns with international principles, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Conclusion:
India's constitutional framework ensures a delicate balance between individual equality and group recognition.
By safeguarding minority rights, the Constitution strengthens the nation's democratic ethos, fostering an inclusive society that respects its rich diversity.
However, evolving socio-political dynamics call for continued vigilance and adaptation to uphold these principles effectively.

**********Reforming National Entrance Exams
Why in News?
A high-level committee, chaired by former ISRO chief
K Radhakrishnan
, has recommended significant reforms to ensure transparency and efficiency in conducting national entrance tests like NEET, CUET, and UGC-NET.
Drawing parallels with the general election framework,
these reforms aim to safeguard the integrity of the examination process and prevent malpractices
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the National Testing Agency (NTA)?
Issues Faced by the NTA
Key Recommendations of the High-Level Committee for Secure Examinations
Conclusion
About NTA:
It was set up in
2017
as a
specialist, self-sustaining and autonomous organisation
under the aegis of the
Union Ministry of Education
It is registered under
the Societies Registration Act 1860
, and falls under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
Its director general and governing body are
appointed by the Union government
Background:
In 2010
, a committee comprising directors of IITs recommended establishing an autonomous and transparent body (NTA) through legislation, modelled after the
Educational Testing Service (ETS) of the US
Prior to the NTA’s formation
, various government bodies like the UGC, the CBSE, and central universities such as Delhi University and JNU conducted their own entrance examinations.
Objectives:
It aims to
Conduct efficient, transparent and international standards tests
in order to assess the competency of candidates for admission, and recruitment purposes.
Undertake research on educational, professional and testing systems
to identify gaps in the knowledge systems and take steps for bridging them.
Identify experts and institutions in setting examination questions.
Produce and disseminate information and research on education and professional development standards.
Examinations conducted by the NTA:
JEE (Main), NEET-UG, Common Management Admission Test (CMAT), Graduate Pharmacy Aptitude Test (GPAT), University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET), etc.
The National Education Policy 2020
recommends a broader role for the NTA to conduct an entrance or aptitude test for all universities across the country.
Issues Faced by the NTA:
Issue of accountability
Computer-based tests
ensure that high volume can be processed in a short period of time.
As the NIC [National Informatics Centre] does not have the capacity or IT infrastructure needed,
third-party technical partners are being engaged.
This
takes accountability out of the government’s hands
and leaves loopholes in the system which can be exploited by unscrupulous players.
Shortage of manpower:
The agency was set up with only about 25 permanent staff positions and its functions have been outsourced to technical partners from the very beginning.
Absence of robust security mechanisms:
These are needed to handle a large-scale pen-and-paper examination, including the
Setting of the question paper and its encryption,
Selection of external printing presses and exam centres,
Transportation to printing presses,
Storage and distribution to examinees at examination centres and
Then the collection and transportation of answer sheets to evaluation centres.
Each of these is a stage where malpractice can occur without robust security mechanisms.
Cases of irregularities:
The integrity of the NEET-UG
was compromised
when the exam question paper was allegedly leaked.
Similarly, the UGC-NET exam was cancelled
a day after being conducted, following reports that its integrity had been breached.
Key Recommendations of the High-Level Committee for Secure Examinations:
Election-style examination framework:
State collaboration for test administration:
A collaborative approach between the Centre and state governments to conduct these exams, similar to how elections are managed.
The state administrative machinery, including district collectors, would play a crucial role in ensuring smooth execution.
Presiding officers and protocols:
Each testing centre will have an NTA-appointed "presiding officer" responsible for overseeing operations, akin to polling booth management during elections.
Sealing and securing centres:
Testing centres are to be sealed before exams and unsealed only in the presence of district administration and NTA officials.
This procedure mirrors the election process, where EVM strong-rooms are locked and guarded.
State and district-level committees:
State-level committees:
Headed by a Chief Secretary-nominated nodal officer, these committees will include representatives from state police, NTA, the Intelligence Bureau (IB), and the NIC.
District-level committees:
Led by district magistrates, to ensure the identification of secure testing centres and develop strategies for question paper transportation with police or paramilitary support.
Background checks for centres:
Testing centres will be vetted based on past records, ownership backgrounds, and intelligence inputs to avoid potential security breaches.
Reducing dependence on 3rd-party agencies:
Phasing out reliance on private test delivery agencies (TCS iON) and collaborating with Kendriya and Navodaya Vidyalayas to develop digital infrastructure for computer-based testing.
Digi-exam system:
Inspired by the
DigiYatra model
, the proposed "digi-exam" system will ensure candidate verification using biometric data and a one-time entry of primary identification information during the application process.
CCTV monitoring and sanitised centres:
Continuous CCTV monitoring of candidates during the exam.
Sanitisation of computer-based testing centres by third parties, with additional checks by NIC and NTA representatives.
District-level CCTV monitoring centres to oversee exam operations.
Redefining NTA’s role:
The NTA should focus solely on entrance exams for higher education, leaving recruitment exams for other bodies.
Flexibility in exam modes
: Regarding NEET, the decision on the mode of the exam - computer-based or pen-and-paper - will rest with the Health Ministry, with the NTA acting as a service provider.
Conclusion:
The proposed reforms mark a significant shift towards ensuring fairness and efficiency in national entrance tests.
By adopting an election-style framework and leveraging technology,
the government aims to restore trust in the examination system and safeguard its integrity.

**********India and Sri Lanka need to go beyond the stated positions
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India Sri Lanka Relations;
Why in the News?
Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s visit to India, his first international trip as per tradition, underscores the continuity in India-Sri Lanka bilateral relations.
What are the current China-related challenges in India-Sri Lanka relations?
Geopolitical Tensions:
Sri Lanka’s historical ties with China, particularly during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, have raised concerns in India regarding potential Chinese influence in the region.
China’s investment in Sri Lanka, particularly in the
Hambantota Port
, is closely tied to its broader
String of Pearls
strategy.
Economic Dependency:
Sri Lanka’s reliance on Chinese investments has created a “debt trap” scenario, limiting its ability to align with Indian interests fully. The need for economic assistance from both nations complicates Sri Lanka’s foreign policy decisions, as it seeks support without alienating either side.
Balancing Act:
Sri Lanka is attempting to navigate its relationships with India and China, which often puts it in a difficult position.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has expressed intentions to strengthen ties with India while maintaining relations with China, indicating a desire for a balanced approach. However, this balancing act is complicated by India’s concerns over Chinese influence and activities in the Indian Ocean.
How can India and Sri Lanka enhance their economic and strategic partnerships?
Trade Agreements:
There is a push for an upgraded India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to facilitate bilateral trade and investment. This could include provisions for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) protection and expanded coverage of goods and services.
Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme:
Implementing a regional PLI scheme could encourage Indian businesses to invest in Sri Lanka, particularly in sectors like renewable energy and electronics. This initiative would help build regional supply chains and reduce dependency on imports.
B2B Engagement:
Strengthening business-to-business ties, especially between smaller enterprises, could enhance economic collaboration. This involves increasing participation in trade fairs and fostering connections between businesses in southern Indian states and Sri Lanka.
What role does regional stability play? (Way forward)
Security Cooperation:
Regional stability is crucial for both nations as they address external threats, particularly from China. Dissanayake’s assurance that Sri Lankan territory will not be used against Indian interests is vital for maintaining security cooperation and trust between the two countries.
Economic Recovery:
As Sri Lanka recovers from its recent economic crisis, stable relations with India are essential for securing ongoing support from international financial institutions like the IMF. Enhanced cooperation can serve as a model for regional partnerships that promote stability and economic growth across South Asia.
Geopolitical Balance:
A collaborative approach can help mitigate risks associated with external influences and ensure that both nations can pursue their national interests without compromising sovereignty.
Mains PYQ:
What do you understand by ‘The String of Pearls’? How does it impact India? Briefly outline the steps taken by India to counter this.

**********China is the world’s largest debt collector
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Regional geo-politics in Asia and western countries; China's 'Debt Trap Policy;
Why in the News?
By the end of 2023, China emerged as the leading debt collector, holding over 25% of the world’s bilateral external debt.
Two decades ago, Japan, followed by
Germany, France, the United States
, and the
United Kingdom,
dominated global lending, with China rarely extending loans.
What is China’s ‘Debt Trap Policy’?
China’s “Debt Trap Policy”
(also known as the ‘slicing strategy’)
refers to a strategy where it provides
excessive loans
to developing countries, often for large infrastructure projects, which these nations struggle to repay. This policy is primarily associated with
China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
When countries default on their loans, they may be forced to cede control of critical assets to China, effectively creating a debt-for-equity swap.
Notable examples
include
Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port,
which was leased to China for 99 years after the country failed to meet repayment obligations.
Which countries have been affected by China’s debt trap policy?
Sri Lanka:
Struggled with $8 billion in debt, leading to the leasing of the Hambantota port.
Pakistan:
Owes approximately $22 billion, close to 60% of its bilateral debt.
Laos:
Faces significant economic challenges with $6 billion owed to China, over 75% of its bilateral debt.
Angola:
Owes $17 billion, about 58% of its external debt.
These countries often find themselves in financial distress due to high interest rates and the burden of debt repayments consuming essential public resources.
How are developing countries managing their debt to China?
Developing countries are employing various strategies to manage their debts to China:
Debt Restructuring:
Nations like Zambia are negotiating terms to restructure their debts in light of economic difficulties.
Attracting Investment:
Countries are seeking new foreign investments or loans from other nations or institutions to alleviate their financial burdens.
Engaging in Bilateral Talks:
Some nations are attempting to engage China in discussions aimed at debt forgiveness or more favourable repayment terms. However, China’s reluctance to forgive debt complicates these negotiations.
What are the implications of this debt burden on regional and global geopolitics?
The implications of China’s debt policies extend beyond economics into geopolitics:
Increased Influence:
By becoming the largest creditor, China gains substantial leverage over debtor nations, potentially influencing their foreign policy and strategic decisions. This is particularly evident in South Asia and Africa, where countries may align more closely with Chinese interests due to their indebtedness.
Economic Dependency:
Nations heavily reliant on Chinese loans risk becoming economically dependent on China, which can limit their sovereignty and decision-making capabilities. This dependency can also lead to geopolitical tensions with other powers, such as India or the United States.
Potential Instability:
The growing debt burden could lead to financial crises in several nations, resulting in political instability. The inability of countries like Sri Lanka and Pakistan to manage their debts raises concerns about broader regional stability and economic health.
What are the challenges to India due to this policy?
Rising Chinese Influence and Strategic Risks:
China’s lending practices are expanding its influence in South Asia, particularly in nations like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, undermining India’s role as a regional leader.
This includes control over strategic assets such as Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port and infrastructure under the
China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in the POK region,
which poses direct security threats to India.
Geopolitical and Economic Competition:
China’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, coupled with favorable loan terms, challenges India’s investments and diplomatic efforts.
Regional Instability and Spillover Effects:
Debt-driven economic instability in countries like Sri Lanka results in political unrest and humanitarian crises, which can spill over into India, necessitating responses to refugee inflows and potential destabilization in the region.
Way forward:
Strengthening Regional Partnerships:
India should enhance economic and strategic cooperation with neighbouring countries through competitive financing, capacity-building initiatives, and infrastructure projects under transparent terms to counter China’s influence and foster regional stability.
Promoting Multilateral Solutions:
India can collaborate with global institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and Quad partners to offer alternative financial support.
Mains PYQ:
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is viewed as a cardinal subset of China’s larger ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative. Give a brief description of CPEC and enumerate the reasons why India has distanced itself from the same.

Why in the News?
Sovereign gold bonds provide a safer and more cost-effective alternative to holding physical gold, as they reduce risks and storage expenses. However, the central government is considering discontinuing the SGB scheme.
What is the Sovereign Gold Bond scheme?
About
GOI launched it on October 30, 2015.
Structural Mandate
Nodal Agency:
Ministry of Finance;
Issued by
RBI
on behalf of the GOI.
Aims and Objectives
To reduce dependence on gold imports and shift savings from physical gold to paper form.
Targeted Beneficiaries
Residents of India, including individuals, HUFs, trusts, universities, and charitable institutions.
Funding Mechanism
The Sovereign Gold Bonds are issued by the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
Government of India
. This ensures a sovereign guarantee for both the principal and interest payments.
The bonds are made available for subscription in tranches. The RBI notifies the terms and conditions for each tranche, including the subscription dates and issue price, which is based on the average closing price of gold of
999 purity
published by the
India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA).
SGBs are sold through various channels, including
scheduled commercial banks (excluding small finance banks)
, designated post offices,
Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited (SHCIL
), and recognized stock exchanges like
NSE and BSE
Features
Sovereign gold Bonds are issued in 1-gram denominations with an 8-year tenure and early exit from the 5th year.
The minimum investment is 1 gram, a maximum 4 kg for individuals, and 20 kg for trusts.
Benefits include security, interest, and loan collateral.
What are the concerns regarding sovereign gold bonds?
High Cost of Financing:
The government perceives the cost of financing its fiscal deficit through SGBs as disproportionately high compared to the benefits provided to investors. This perception has led to a significant reduction in the issuance of SGBs, dropping from ten tranches annually to just two.
Limited Issuance in Current Financial Year:
In the financial year 2024-25,
no new sovereign gold bonds
have been issued so far, and net borrowing through these bonds has been significantly reduced from previous estimates.
Market Competition from Physical Gold:
The recent reduction in customs duty on gold from
15% to 6%
has led to a surge in demand for
physical gold.
Investors may prefer holding physical gold over waiting for returns from debt securities like SGBs, which require maturity periods before realizing gains.
What are the challenges due to the import of Gold?
Impact on Trade Deficit
: Gold imports are a major contributor to India’s trade deficit, with a record $14.8 billion spent in November 2024, which weakened the rupee. Between 2016 and 2020, gold imports made up 86% of the country’s gold supply, leading to significant foreign exchange outflows and economic instability.
Encouragement of Smuggling
: High import duties on gold have driven a rise in smuggling, with 65% to 75% of smuggled gold entering India through air routes. This illegal trade undermines government revenue and complicates market regulation.
Way forward:
Increase Liquidity and Accessibility
: Similar to gold-backed ETFs in the U.S. and Gold Bullion Securities in Australia, India can enhance the liquidity of SGBs by allowing them to be traded on stock exchanges, providing easy access and better market engagement for investors.
Encourage Regular Investments
: Drawing inspiration from Germany’s gold savings plans, India can introduce flexible investment options such as monthly or quarterly contributions, enabling dollar-cost averaging and attracting retail investors over time.
Mains PYQ:
Craze for gold in Indian has led to surge in import of gold in recent years and put pressure on balance of payments and external value of rupee. In view of this, examine the merits of Gold Monetization scheme.

**********Arctic Tundra is emitting more Carbon than it absorbs: NOAA
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
The
, a frozen treeless biome, has traditionally
served as a carbon sink
, storing vast amounts of carbon for thousands of years.
However, recent changes in this ecosystem are turning it into a source of
greenhouse gases (GHGs)
, primarily
carbon dioxide (CO2)
methane (CH4)
according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
What is Arctic Tundra?
cold, treeless biome
located in the
northernmost regions
of Earth, primarily within the
Arctic Circle
Climate
Experiences
long, harsh winters
short, cool summers
Temperatures range from
-28°C
in winter to
3°C
in summer.
Ground is
permanently frozen
, restricting
plant root growth
and shaping the ecosystem.
24-hour daylight
in summer and
long polar nights
in winter.
Biodiversity and Vegetation:
Limited to
low-growing vegetation
like
mosses
lichens
grasses
, and
small shrubs
, adapted to short growing seasons.
Hosts animals like
Arctic foxes
polar bears
caribou
migratory birds
, though overall biodiversity is low.
Adaptations
Animals
: Thick fur and fat layers in species like
to survive extreme cold.
Plants
: Shallow roots for quick nutrient absorption during short summers.
How does the Arctic Tundra store Carbon?
Arctic tundra
stores carbon primarily through a process where
plants
from the atmosphere via
photosynthesis
This carbon gets trapped in the
soil
organic matter
(plants and animals) that accumulate over time.
The cold Arctic climate slows the
decomposition
of plant and animal remains, meaning that organic materials, including carbon, remain locked in the
permafrost
This permafrost acts as a
natural storage
system, preventing CO2 from being released back into the atmosphere.
Scientists estimate that the Arctic tundra holds about
1.6 trillion metric tonnes of carbon
, which is roughly
double
the amount of carbon in the Earth’s atmosphere.
Why is the Arctic Tundra emitting more carbon than absorbing it?
Rising temperatures
in the Arctic are causing the
thaw
at an accelerated rate.
When permafrost thaws,
microbes
in the soil become active, breaking down the
trapped in the frozen ground, which results in the release of
, two potent greenhouse gases.
The Arctic has been warming at a rate
four times faster
than the global average.
2024
was the
second-warmest year
on record for the region, contributing significantly to the thawing of the permafrost.
Wildfires
in the Arctic have become more frequent and intense, further
accelerating the thawing of permafrost
. Wildfire smoke also contributes to the release of greenhouse gases.
Between
2001 and 2020
, the combination of rising temperatures and increased wildfires led to the Arctic tundra releasing
than it absorbed, marking a significant shift in its role from a
carbon emitter
