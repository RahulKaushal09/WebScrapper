MUDRA 2.0 Loans Should Target Greater Equity, Deepen Financial Literacy
Context
The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) was launched in 2015
by the Narendra Modi government with the primary aim of fostering entrepreneurship in India.
By offering collateral-free micro-loans of up to ₹10 lakh,
the scheme sought to empower small and micro-enterprises,
significantly contributing to the grassroots economy.
As the government anticipates the next phase, MUDRA 2.0, it is essential to evaluate the successes and challenges of MUDRA 1.0
to ensure that future initiatives are more impactful and inclusive.
Successes of MUDRA 1.0
has been instrumental in disbursing over Rs 27.75 lakh crore to 47 crore small and new entrepreneurs,
significantly impacting India's grassroots economy.
By offering financial support to individuals previously excluded from formal credit systems,
the scheme has played a crucial role in promoting economic inclusivity.
Approximately 69% of MUDRA loan accounts are held by women,
and 51% belong to entrepreneurs from SC/ST and OBC communities.
This
focus on marginalised groups has helped promote gender equality and social equity,
enabling broader participation in the country's economic growth.
Moreover,
MUDRA 1.0 has been pivotal in job creation, especially in rural and semi-urban areas.
By encouraging self-employment and supporting the development of small businesses,
the scheme has contributed to reducing unemployment and enhancing economic opportunities
for underserved communities.
Challenges Faced by Mudra 1.0
Unequal Distribution of Credit
Despite the scheme's goal of promoting inclusivity,
the disbursement of loans was heavily skewed in favour of more developed districts.
For instance,
in the fiscal year 2021-22, the top 10 districts received loans amounting to over Rs 26,000 crore
, a figure that matched the total sanctioned for the bottom 318 districts combined.
disparity indicates that rural and remote regions, which were supposed to be the primary beneficiaries of the scheme, lagged significantly behind
in accessing MUDRA loans.
Inadequate Monitoring and Implementation
not only undermined the effectiveness of the scheme but also eroded the trust of beneficiaries
and financial institutions in the system.
monitoring gaps were particularly evident in the higher proportion of non-performing assets (NPAs)
under the scheme.
Although the overall NPA ratio under MUDRA loans decreased from 3.61% in FY21 to 2.1% in FY24, the Kishore and Shishu categories—loans ranging between Rs 50,001 and Rs 5 lakh and loans up to Rs 50,000, respectively—accounted for more than 75% of bad loans from FY20 to FY22.
persistent high NPA levels in these categories highlighted the need for better oversight and more stringent credit appraisal processes
to ensure that loans were being disbursed to viable enterprises with the capacity to repay.
Limited Financial Literacy Among Beneficiaries
According to available data,
only 27% of India's population is financially literate,
which means a significant portion of MUDRA beneficiaries did not have the skills to budget, save, or plan for loan repayments.
lack of financial literacy led to widespread issues of financial mismanagement and defaults,
particularly among early-stage entrepreneurs.
High NPAs in Key Categories
issue of high NPAs in the Kishore and Shishu loan categories posed a significant challenge
to the sustainability of MUDRA 1.0.
From FY20 to FY22,
the NPA percentage in the Kishore category consistently remained above 4%
which is significantly higher than the average NPA rate across all loan categories.
elevated NPA rate in the Kishore and Shishu categories can be largely attributed to the lack of business acumen
and experience
among the borrowers.
Many of these entrepreneurs were in the nascent stages of their businesses and lacked the necessary skills to effectively manage and grow their enterprises.
Furthermore,
the high NPA levels reflect broader systemic issues,
such as inadequate support and mentorship for entrepreneurs and
a lack of targeted interventions to help struggling businesses.
The Insufficient Credit Guarantee Mechanism
Another challenge was the
absence of a robust credit guarantee mechanism to protect financial institutions from potential losses.
lack of a safety net made banks hesitant to lend to small and micro-entrepreneurs,
particularly those perceived as high-risk borrowers.
Without adequate guarantees, banks were more cautious in their lending practices,
which constrained the flow of credit to the very groups that MUDRA was designed to support.
insufficient credit guarantee mechanism not only limited the reach of the scheme but also contributed to the unequal distribution of credit.
Financial institutions tended to favour borrowers in more developed regions, where the perceived risk was lower
, further exacerbating the disparities in loan distribution between urban and rural areas.
Proposed Changes for MUDRA 2.0 to Address the Challenges Faced by MUDRA 1.0
Focused Outreach and Empowerment Zones
One of the critical changes for MUDRA 2.0 is the
establishment of Focused Outreach and Empowerment Zones,
particularly in rural and semi-urban areas
where the need for financial support is most pronounced.
These zones
would provide access to financial services, including micro-loans, savings accounts, and insurance products.
By bringing these services closer to the target population,
the scheme can better reach those who have been traditionally excluded
from the formal financial system.
Nationwide Financial Literacy Programs
Given the low levels of financial literacy observed among MUDRA 1.0 beneficiaries,
a nationwide financial literacy initiative should be a cornerstone of MUDRA 2.0.
financial literacy curriculum would be tailored to the specific needs of micro and small entrepreneurs.
Topics would include understanding interest rates, managing cash flow, preparing for taxes
, and the importance of savings and investment.
Special emphasis would be placed on digital financial literacy
, given the growing importance of digital payments and online banking.
Enhanced Credit Guarantee Scheme (ECGS)
To address the hesitancy of banks in lending to small and micro-enterprises
, MUDRA 2.0 should include an ECGS.
scheme would reduce the risk for financial institutions
, encouraging them to extend more credit to the target beneficiaries.
ECGS would provide a credit guarantee to banks and other financial institutions,
covering a significant portion of the loan amount in case of default.
risk-sharing mechanism would make financial institutions more willing to lend to high-risk borrowers,
such as first-time entrepreneurs and those in underserved regions.
Robust Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (RMEF)
RMEF is essential
for ensuring the transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of MUDRA 2.0.
framework would leverage technology to monitor the entire lifecycle of loans
, from disbursement to repayment, in real-time.
RMEF would incorporate digital tools to track loan disbursements,
utilisation, and repayments.
real-time tracking would help in identifying potential issues early,
such as delays in repayment or misuse of funds, allowing for timely interventions.
Conclusion
MUDRA 1.0 has made significant strides in promoting entrepreneurship
and economic inclusivity in India.
However, its challenges, particularly in reaching marginalised groups
and ensuring effective loan management,
underscore the need for a more comprehensive approach in MUDRA 2.0.
By expanding its scope,
improving financial literacy, introducing enhanced credit guarantees, and implementing a robust monitoring framework,
MUDRA 2.0 can build on the successes of its predecessor while addressing its shortcomings.

**********What is Sonoluminescence?
About Sonoluminescence
It is a fascinating phenomenon where
small gas bubbles in a liquid emit a brief flash of light
when exposed to intense sound waves.
This phenomenon was first observed in
1934
by two German engineers studying sonar, a method of using sound waves for navigation similar to how bats operate.
How does sonoluminescence work?
Sound wave interaction:
The process begins when a tiny bubble trapped in a liquid is subjected to
powerful sound waves.
These waves cause the bubble to rapidly expand and contract due to alternating high and low-pressure phases.
Extreme conditions:
During the contraction phase, the bubble compresses so rapidly that its internal temperature skyrockets to several thousand kelvins.
This extreme heat ionizes the gases inside the bubble, resulting in the
emission of light energy
for a fraction of a second—about a trillionth of a second.
Natural occurrence:
Pistol Shrimp:
Sonoluminescence is not confined to laboratory settings. In nature, the
pistol shrimp
(family Alpheidae) exhibits a similar effect.
This shrimp has a
specialized claw
that snaps shut with remarkable speed, creating a high-velocity jet of water.
This jet forms a low-pressure bubble that, upon collapsing, produces a loud sound, intense heat, and a brief flash of light.
Applications:
Scientific curiosity:
Sonoluminescence continues to captivate scientists due to its mysterious nature and potential applications.
While the phenomenon is primarily of academic interest, it has sparked discussions about its potential use in fields like
thermonuclear fusion

**********India adds 3 new Ramsar sites
Why in news?
Three new wetlands have got the Ramsar site tag taking the total tally of Ramsar wetlands to 85 in India. The three new Ramsar sites are
Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary
Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary
in Tamil Nadu and
Tawa Reservoir
in Madhya Pradesh.
What’s in today’s article?
Wetlands and their significance
What are Wetlands?
About
Wetlands are areas where water covers the soil or is present at or near the surface, creating unique ecosystems.
The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands defines wetlands as areas that can be natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, where water may be static or flowing, and can be fresh, brackish, or salty.
This includes marshes, fens, peatlands, and even shallow marine waters up to six meters deep at low tide.
The definition emphasizes the diversity of wetland types, covering various water conditions and both inland and coastal ecosystems.
Significance
Wetlands help regulate climate conditions through carbon sequestration, that is, carbon storage from the atmosphere.
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world, comparable to rainforests and coral reefs.
They play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity, regulating water cycles, and acting as natural water purifiers.
In India, wetlands like the Sundarbans in West Bengal and Chilika Lake in Odisha provide critical habitats for wildlife, support livelihoods through fishing and agriculture, and help in flood control, making them vital for environmental and economic stability.
Wetlands in India
In India, wetlands are spread over 15260572 square kilometres (sq km) which is ~4.63 per cent of the total geographical area of the country.
Of this area, inland-natural wetlands account for 45 % and coastal-natural wetlands 25%.
State-wise distribution of wetlands showed that Lakshadweep has 96.12% of geographic area under wetlands followed by Andaman and Nicobar Islands (18.52%), Daman and Diu (18.46%) and Gujarat (17.56%), have the highest extent of wetlands.
Steps taken by India to protect wetlands
The Indian government has launched a series of policies and initiatives to protect wetlands, like the
National Wetland Conservation Programme of 1986 and the 2015 National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Wetlands
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has also identified over 2,200 wetlands for conservation schemes.
What are Ramsar sites?
The Ramsar Convention, formally known as the Convention on Wetlands, is an international treaty established in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar.
Its primary goal is to conserve and sustainably use wetlands, which are vital ecosystems that provide numerous ecological, economic, and cultural benefits.
Convention encourages the designation of "Ramsar sites,"
which are wetlands of international importance due to their unique ecological characteristics.
Member countries are obligated to maintain the ecological character of these sites and promote their sustainable use.
Members
Organisations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the World-Wide Fund for Nature, and other environmental agencies are associated with the treaty.
It also has 172 signatory countries.
Criteria
The selection of Ramsar sites is based on various criteria defined under the convention.
For example, “A wetland should be considered internationally important if it supports plant and/or animal species at a critical stage in their life cycles, or provides refuge during adverse conditions.”
It also looks at the sites’ capacity to support fishes and waterbirds.
Ramsar and India
India joined it in 1982, initially designating the Chilika Lake in Orissa and Keoladeo National Park in Rajasthan.
Today, the country has among the
highest number of Ramsar sites in Asia
Located on the banks of the Noyyal River, it was initially a water reservoir for irrigation but has evolved into a crucial ecosystem.
It supports diverse bird species, including the Eurasian coot, spot-billed duck, and various herons, and attracts migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway.
The wetland is now a biodiversity hotspot and supports local livelihoods through fishing.
Kazhuveli Sanctuary
Situated on the Coromandel Coast, it is one of the largest brackish water wetlands in south India.
The ecosystem i’s mix of salt marshes, mudflats and shallow waters make it a home to many globally endangered species, like the black-headed ibis and greater flamingo.
It is also a stopover for migratory birds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway.
In storing water, Kazhuveli also helps with flood control and groundwater recharge, helping maintain the region’s water table.
It is integral in regional water management.
Created by damming the Tawa River, the reservoir became a massive wintering ground for migratory birds.
Tawa provides irrigation water to farmlands, drinking water to local communities, and sustains the nearby fisheries.

**********Child Adoption in India
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background
Adoption in India (Legal definitions, provisions, CARA, who can adopt, who can be adopted)
Conclusion
Background:
Of the 18,179 adoptions recorded since 2019, only 1,404 involved children with special needs even as the absolute numbers of adoptions saw an increase over the next five years, according to official data.
Though the number of children with special needs for adoption has risen, the adoption rate is still significantly low, activists pointed out.
What is Adoption in legal terms?
Adoption is the formal process through which
a child is permanently separated from his biological parents to become the lawful child of his adoptive parents
The adopted child enjoys all rights, privileges and responsibilities attached to a biological child.
Legal Provisions w.r.t Adoption in India:
In India, two legislations deal with the adoption of a child:
Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
(HAMA)
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
This includes Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 and Adoption Regulations, 2017.
The fundamental principles that govern adoption state that –
Interests of the child are most important and
Preference is to be given to place the child in adoption with Indian citizens with “due regard to the principle of placement of the child in his socio-cultural environment, as far as possible”.
CARA functions as the nodal agency for adoption in India.
A database of children and registration of prospective parents is done on a centralised Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System (
CARINGS
), which is maintained by CARA.
About Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA):
CARA is a statutory body established under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
CARA functions as the nodal body for adoption of Indian children and is mandated to monitor and regulate in-country and inter-country adoptions.
It primarily deals with adoption of orphan, abandoned and surrendered children through its associated/recognised adoption agencies.
CARA is designated as the Central Authority to deal with inter-country adoptions in accordance with the provisions of the
Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption, 1993
Who can be Adopted?
An orphan, abandoned, or surrendered child who has been declared legally free for adoption by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) can be adopted.
This only happens under the provisions of the JJ Act 2015.
A child of a relative — paternal uncle or aunt, a maternal uncle or aunt or paternal and maternal grandparents — can be adopted.
According to CARA, children of the spouse from earlier marriage surrendered by the biological parent(s) can also be adopted by the step-parent.
Who can Adopt?
The Ministry of Woman and Child Development states that
irrespective of marital status and whether or not they have a biological son or daughter, a person can adopt if
The prospective adoptive parent (PAP) is physically, mentally stable, financially capable and should not have any life-threatening medical condition,
In the case of a married couple, two years of stable marital relationship and consent of both spouses are required for adoption.
While a single woman can adopt a child of any gender, a single male is not eligible to adopt a girl child.
The minimum age difference between the child and either of the prospective adoptive parents should not be less than 25 years.
Couples with three or more children are not considered except in the case of adoption of children with special needs or hard-to-place children.
Reasons Behind Low Level Adoption in India:
India has a significant number of orphaned and abandoned children living in Child Care Institutions (CCIs), yet the adoption rates remain low.
Despite over 28,000 prospective parents registered with the CARA, only about 2,200 children are legally available for adoption. This discrepancy is due to several factors.
Lengthy and Exhausting Process:
Many prospective parents face years of waiting with no assurance of when they will be able to adopt.
The process is emotionally draining, with little communication from CARA, leading to frustration and disappointment.
Systemic Delays:
The journey from finding an orphaned child to placing them in an adoptive home involves multiple steps, including legal formalities that can take years to complete.
Even after being identified, many children in CCIs do not make it to the adoption pool due to incomplete paperwork or other procedural delays.
Social and Cultural Barriers:
Historically, Indian society has been resistant to adoption due to social issues like caste, class, and genetics.
However, the growing number of prospective adoptive parents indicates a shift in societal attitudes, with more people now embracing adoption as a way to build a family.
Special Needs and Older Children:
A significant challenge is the adoption of older children, siblings, and those with disabilities.
These categories often remain unadopted in India, although foreign adoptive parents are more open to adopting children with special needs.
Conclusion:
While there is an increasing awareness and acceptance of adoption in India, the process remains fraught with delays and systemic issues that need urgent reforms.
Ensuring timely legal procedures, better communication, and a more inclusive approach to adoption can help address these challenges and provide homes for many more children.

**********Fallouts of Lithium Mining
Why in News?
According to a new study, Chile’s Atacama salt flat (flat expanses of ground covered with salt and other minerals) is sinking at a rate of 1 to 2 cm per year due to lithium brine extraction.
The process of extracting lithium from brine involves pumping salt-rich water to the top and through a sequence of evaporation ponds in order to recover lithium.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is Lithium Mining?
Lithium Reserves and Mining in India
Environmental Challenges Posed by Lithium Mining
Fallouts of Lithium Mining in Chile
Lithium mining refers to the extraction of lithium primarily from brine water and hard-rock (spodumene) deposits.
Brine extraction
, which accounts for 66% of the total lithium production, involves pumping underground brine to the surface and allowing the water to evaporate, leaving behind lithium carbonate.
Hard-rock mining
involves extracting lithium-bearing minerals from rock through traditional mining techniques.
Lithium production
has dramatically increased over the past decade.
The global output surpassed 100,000 tonnes (tonne = metric ton) for the first time in 2021, a fourfold increase from 2010.
In 2022, global lithium mines produced an estimated 130,000 metric tons.
Lithium Reserves and Mining in India:
The Geological Survey of India (GSI) had for the
first time in India's history
established Lithium inferred resources of 5.9 million tonnes in
Jammu and Kashmir’s Reasi district.
Months after India's first lithium reserves,
the GSI has found another reserve of the crucial mineral
in Degana in Rajasthan's Nagaur district.
These reserves are believed to be much bigger in quantity (than found in J&K) and
can meet 80% of the total country's demand.
The Ministry of Mines successfully
auctioned off India’s first lithium block
in Chhattisgarh’s
Korba
district (Katghora region) recently.
Environmental Challenges Posed by Lithium Mining:
Deplete water resources:
Extracting one ton of lithium requires approximately 500,000 litres of water, which can deplete water resources in arid regions and impact local communities and ecosystems.
Contaminate soil and water sources:
The chemicals used in lithium extraction, such as sulfuric acid, can contaminate soil and water sources, posing risks to human health and wildlife.
Carbon emissions:
Lithium mining, particularly from hard rock sources, is energy-intensive, requiring substantial electricity for crushing, grinding, and chemical separation processes.
This energy often comes from
non-renewable sources,
exacerbating carbon emissions and the carbon footprint of lithium production.
Fallouts of Lithium Mining in Chile:
The research has shown that lithium mining (over the years) has had severe environmental fallouts, especially in countries such as Chile.
The satellite data collected between 2020 and 2023 shows
deformations in the Earth’s crust of Atacama salt flat
- one of the largest sources of lithium in the world.
The worst affected areas are those where mining companies are doing most of their pumping of lithium-rich brine.
That is happening because the
pumping takes place at a faster rate than the recharge
of aquifers, leading to
subsidence
or the downward vertical movement of the Earth’s surface.

**********Drug money endangering country’s security, economy
Why in news?
Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation virtually inaugurated the Zonal Unit Office of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Reaffirming Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to a drug-free India by 2047, the Home Minister emphasized that drugs not only devastate the nation's youth but also undermine national security and the economy. The
revenue generated from illegal drug trade fuels terrorism and left-wing extremism, posing a serious threat to the country
What’s in today’s article?
Drug Menace in India – Reasons behind increase in drug use
About
NCB is the apex drug law enforcement and intelligence agency of India, established in 1986 under the
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS Act), 1985
The NCB is responsible for combating drug trafficking and the abuse of illegal substances.
Nodal ministry:
NCB operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.
Performance of NCB
Between 2014 and 2024, 4,150 drug cases were registered, a 230% rise from the 1,250 cases between 2004 and 2014.
Arrests surged from 1,360 to 6,300, and drug seizures grew by 257%.
The value of drugs seized between 2004 to 2014 was ₹5,900 crore while the value of drugs seized between 2014 to 2024 was ₹22,000 crore.
In terms of volume, 5,43,000 kg of drugs were seized between 2014 and 2024.
Drug menace in India - Reasons for Widespread Drug Abuse in India
To escape from hard realities of life
The disintegration of the old joint family system, decline of old religious and moral values etc. lead to a rise in the number of drug addicts who take drugs to escape hard realities of life.
Loosening of the traditional methods of social control
The loosening of the traditional methods of social control left an individual vulnerable to the stresses and strains of modern life.
Peers pressure
Many youths start using drug under the pressure from their friends, seniors at educational institutions, or by members of their informal groupings.
Easy Availability
India is situated in the sense that on its west is the ‘Golden Crescent’ and on east is the ‘Golden Triangle’.
Golden Crescent - Iran-Afghanistan-Pakistan
Golden Triangle - Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar
The usage of drugs in India is increasing, particularly in the border areas due to their porous nature.
Economic prosperity
The agricultural reforms and other industrial activity have led to increase in income in regions like Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra etc.
Increase in disposable money and easy availability of drugs has led to increase in its use.
Fight against drug menace – India’s regulatory framework
Article 47 of the Indian Constitution
The National Policy on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances is based on the Directive Principles, contained in Article 47 of the Indian Constitution.
The Article directs the State to endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption, except for medicinal purposes, of intoxicating drugs injurious to health.
Signatory to international conventions
India is a signatory to:
the single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, the Conventions on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 and the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988.
Existing Laws
The broad legislative policy is contained in the three Central Acts:
Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940,
NDPS Act, 1985, and
The Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988.
Institutions involved
was created in 1986 as a nodal agency to fight against this menace.
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) are involved with alcohol and drug demand reduction policies and drug de-addiction programme.
In order to prevent misuse of dual-use drugs
permanent inter-ministerial committee
has been formed with the ministry of health and family welfare and the ministry of chemicals.
Technological intervention
The NCORD (Narco Coordination Centre) portal has been launched as an effective mechanism for information exchange between various institutions/agencies.
A toll-free helpline called
MANAS (Madak Padarth Nishedh Asuchna Kendra)
with the number 1933 has been launched.
Other measures
The government aims to achieve
through a 3 points strategy - strengthening of institutional structure, coordination among all narco agencies and extensive public awareness campaign.
As part of this strategy a number of steps have been taken which includes:
Establishment of a dedicated Anti-Narcotics Task Force (ANTF) in each state/UTs.
High priority to Drug Disposal drive.
Launch of NIDAAN Portal
for Narco offenders.
Creation of canine squads for drug detection.
Strengthening the forensic capabilities.
Establishment of Special NDPS Courts and Fast Track Courts.

**********Frequent mass wasting in Tibet a cause for worry in India 
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Location of Sedongpu Gully
Mains level:
Cause of Mass Wasting Events;
Why in the News?
A recent study on frequent mass wasting in Sedongpu Gully and rapid warming raises concerns for India’s Northeast region.
About Sedongpu Gully:
The Sedongpu gully (29°47′7.20′′N, 94°55′24′′E) is in the large bend region of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, located in the
southeastern Tibetan Plateau.
Debris flows have occurred in two adjacent gullies, namely Sedongpu Gully (SDP) and Zelongnong Gully (ZLN), since the 1950s.
Frequency of Mass Wasting Events
Since 2017, over
700 million cubic meters of debris
have been mobilized in the Sedongpu Gully catchment, with more than
68% of the total 19 identified mass-wasting events
occurring in this period.
The events include ice-rock avalanches (IRAs), ice-moraine avalanches (IMAs), and glacier debris flows (GDFs).
Geological Causes:
The increased frequency of mass wasting is attributed to a combination of
long-term warming and seismic activity.
The area rarely experienced temperatures above 0º C before 2012, but climate change has led to significant warming,
destabilizing permafrost and increasing landslide activity.
6.4-magnitude Nyingchi earthquake
in November 2017 also contributed to the
destabilization of slopes.
China’s Plans and Implications for River Management
Hydropower Projects:
China is planning to construct a massive
60-gigawatt hydropower project on the Tsangpo River
, which could
exacerbate sedimentation issues
downstream.
This project is expected to have
three times the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam,
raising concerns about r
iver management and flood risks
in India and Bangladesh.
River Choking and Flash Floods:
The study warns that the i
ncreased sedimentation from mass wasting events
choke river channels
, particularly affecting the
Brahmaputra River system.
Historical Flood Events:
Past incidents, like the
2000 floods in Arunachal Pradesh caused by landslides blocking the Tsangpo River
, show how dangerous landslides can be for areas downstream.
The chance of similar disasters is higher now because of the
ongoing geological instability
in the Sedongpu Gully.
Way forward:
Bilateral and Multilateral Dialogues:
India should intensify diplomatic efforts with China, advocating for shared water management strategies and transparency in hydropower projects on the Tsangpo River.
Real-Time Monitoring:
Establish advanced real-time monitoring systems for the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries, using satellite imagery, remote sensing, and ground-based observations to track landslides, sedimentation, and water flow.
Mains question for practice:
Q
Discuss the potential risks posed by the increasing frequency of mass wasting events in the Sedongpu Gully and the implications for India’s Northeast region.

Less than 1% of educational institutions
in India are disabled-friendly, highlighting a
significant gap in accessibility and support for PwDs
in both education and employment sectors.
Inadequate Infrastructure:
Data shows that fewer than
40% of school buildings
have ramps, and
only about 17% have accessible restrooms.
Despite legislative provisions for reservations in government jobs under the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016,
there is a lack of effective implementation, resulting in low participation of PwDs in the workforce.
Challenges Faced by Persons with Disabilities (PwD)
Social Stigma and Marginalization:
PwDs face
deep-rooted social stigma,
which leads to
discrimination and exclusion
from various sectors, including education and employment.

**********What is Sonoluminescence? 
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Recent studies have provided deeper insights into the
mechanics of Sonoluminescence,
particularly the conditions under which light is emitted from collapsing bubbles in liquids.
Sonoluminescence is a phenomenon in which
small gas bubbles
in a liquid emit short bursts of light
when exposed to intense sound waves.
The light is produced
when the
bubble undergoes rapid compression and expansion.
This is due to the
alternating high- and low-pressure phases
of the sound waves
, causing the gas inside to heat up and emit light.
This phenomenon was
discovered in 1934
by two
German engineers
while they were
studying sonar technology,
which uses sound waves to detect objects underwater.
They noticed that when a tiny bubble in a liquid was hit by strong sound waves, it emitted a brief flash of light.
Mystery behind Sonoluminescence
Although the general mechanism is understood, the
exact details of how the light is produced remain a mystery.
Scientists are
still exploring the precise processes
that cause the gases inside the bubble to ionize and emit light at such high temperatures.
Examples of Sonoluminescence
Controlled Experiments
: In laboratory settings, scientists create sonoluminescence by trapping a bubble in a liquid and subjecting it to high-frequency sound waves.
Pistol Shrimp
: When the shrimp (marine creature with a specialized claw) snaps its claw shut, it shoots out a jet of water that moves so fast it creates a low-pressure bubble. The bubble then collapses, producing a loud sound, intense heat, and sometimes a brief flash of light.
