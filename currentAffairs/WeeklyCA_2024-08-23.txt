What is Global South?
American academic
Carl Oglesby
coined the term
“Global South”
in 1969 to denote a set of countries beset by the
“dominance”
Global North
through political and economic exploitation.
The phrase “Global South” refers broadly to the regions of
Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania
separated by the
Brandt line
It denotes regions
outside Europe and North America
, mostly low-income and often politically or culturally marginalised.
China and India
are the leading proponents of the Global South.
is a visual representation of the
world's economic divide
between the rich north and the poor south, based on
GDP per capita
It was proposed by
Willy Brandt
in the 1970s and encircles the globe at a latitude of roughly
30° North

What are Challenges for India as the “Voice of Global South”?
Geopolitical Competition:
India is increasingly seen as a
competitor
to China in leading the Global South.
China is increasingly making inroads in the Global South through the
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
for developing infrastructure.
Food Security Dilemma:
One of the major challenges India faces as a leader of the Global South is addressing
food security
decision to restrict rice exports in July 2023
has been criticised as inconsistent with its leadership role, especially given its commitment to addressing
global food challenges
Critics argue that such moves could undermine India's claim to lead the Global South.
Pharmaceutical Challenge:
India's reputation as the
"pharmacy of the world"
has also come under
scrutiny due to recent controversies over contaminated medicines
linked to Indian manufacturers.
World Health Organization (WHO)
has issued several warnings about
substandard drugs
, highlighting the need for India to maintain high standards in its
pharmaceutical exports
Internal Development Issues:
Critics argue India should prioritise its domestic development issues like
unequal wealth distribution
, unemployment, and inadequate infrastructure
, before leading others.
India's vast rural population lacks access to
quality healthcare and education
, raising questions about its capacity to address similar issues in other developing nations.
Way Forward
Strengthen Strategic Partnerships
: India should continue to build and strengthen alliances with countries in the Global South, focusing on
collaborative projects
in technology, education, and healthcare.
It can help counter China's influence, particularly in regions where the
is dominant.
Balanced Development Model
: India should advocate for a development model that prioritizes
sustainability and inclusivity
, distinguishing itself from
China's debt trap
approach
India can position itself as a more ethical and people-centered leader.
Reassess Export Policies
: To maintain credibility in the Global South, India should strike a
balance
between domestic
global responsibilities
Investing in
agricultural innovation
and technology can help increase domestic food production, ensuring that India can meet both its domestic needs and international commitments.
Prioritize Domestic Challenges
: Addressing domestic issues such as
poverty, unemployment, and inadequate infrastructure
is essential for India to lead by example.
A strong,
well-developed India will have greater credibility
and moral authority to guide other developing nations.
Drishti Mains Question:
Q. India faces significant challenges in its leadership role within the Global South. How can these challenges be addressed to position India as a responsible and effective leader?
