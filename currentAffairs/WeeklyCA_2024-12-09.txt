Why in News?
The recently released
NITI Aayog’
Trade Watch report
highlights India’s trade prospects, challenges, and growth potential, especially in light of the
US-China trade conflict
and the
'China Plus One' strategy
.
It stated that India has had
"limited success so far"
in capitalizing on the 'China Plus One' strategy adopted by multinational companies to diversify and de-risk their supply chains.
Why Has India Seen "Limited Success" in China+1 Strategy?
Competitive Disadvantages and Regulatory Challenges:
Countries like
Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia
have leveraged
cheaper labor, simplified tax laws, and lower tariffs
to attract multinational corporations looking to diversify away from China.
India's
complex regulations, bureaucratic hurdles, inconsistent policies
higher labor costs
deter investment, with slow administration and unpredictable reforms reducing business competitiveness.
Additionally,
corruption
has eroded investor confidence, increased transaction costs, and undermined India's appeal as an investment destination, despite ongoing anti-corruption efforts.
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs):
South-Asian countries like
have been
more proactive in signing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs),
which has
helped them expand their export shares
India's slower pace in negotiating and finalizing FTAs has put it at a disadvantage.
Geopolitical Tensions and Limited Market Share:
India’s limited share in global trade
(less than 1% in 70% of global trade) highlights
untapped potential.
While geopolitical tensions, like the
US-China trade conflict,
offer opportunities for India to emerge as a
neutral alternative
, they also
create uncertainty, complicating trade strategies
hindering market expansion.
Supply Chain Disruptions:
US export controls and tariffs on China have
fragmented supply chains
, offering India an opportunity. However,
poor infrastructure, inefficient ports,
high logistics costs
have limited India's ability to attract foreign investment.
Carbon Tax Risks and Land Acquisition Issues:
The EU's
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
risks raising costs for India's iron and steel exports, reducing competitiveness.
Additionally, India's c
omplex tax regime and slow land acquisition processes
increase business costs, delaying industrial projects and hindering growth.
What are the Key Growth Drivers for India under the China+1 Strategy?
Large Domestic Market and Demographic Advantage:
1.3 billion population,
with a
youthful demographic
rising incomes,
creates a growing consumer base and a strong workforce.
With India's
real GDP
is projected to grow between
6.5-7%
in 2024-25 and
around half of the population under 30
, India is poised for
sustained economic growth,
positioning it as a key driver of global trade and an attractive investment destination.
Cost Competitiveness and Infrastructure Advantage:
India's production sector benefits from
lower labour and capital costs
compared to competitors like Vietnam, with
manufacturing wages 47% lower than China's
The government's infrastructure initiatives, such as the
National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)
, aim to
reduce manufacturing costs and improve logistics by 20%
, enhancing India's global competitiveness.
Business Environment and Policy Initiatives:
Recent reforms, including the
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme,
tax changes
, and relaxed
FDI norms
, have improved India’s business climate.
Make in India
initiative and simplified business processes further attract foreign investments through incentives for global companies.
Strategic Economic Partnerships:
India’s focus on strategic partnerships, such as the
India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
, enhances its global trade position. These agreements are projected to
boost bilateral trade
200% in five years,
opening new markets while
reducing dependence on any single economy
Dynamic Diplomacy and Global Influence:
India’s active role in forums like
QUAD,
I2U2,
G20
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
strengthens its diplomatic and economic ties. By leading global discussions, India influences
trade trends, attracts investments, and facilitates technology transfer
financial cooperation.
Way Forward
Structural Reforms
Streamline regulations, improve ease of doing business
enhance logistics efficiency
reduce the high costs of
road transport, which currently handles 60% of freight.
Adopt strategies used by countries like
Vietnam and Malaysia,
such as offering
redistributed land for industrial development.
Specialized Industrial Clusters:
Develop dedicated manufacturing hubs with world-class infrastructure,
plug-and-play facilities,
and shared services to enhance sectoral competitiveness.
Skill Development
: Strengthen
vocational training, promote STEM education
upskill the workforce
to meet the demands of high-tech manufacturing.
Sectoral Manufacturing Boost:
Provide
long-term tax incentives and support growth
in emerging sectors like
mobile phones and defense,
while leveraging strengths in t
extiles, leather, auto components, and pharmaceuticals.
Conclusion
India's journey to capture the 'China Plus One' opportunity has been marked by challenges, including competitive disadvantages, regulatory hurdles, and sector-specific issues.
