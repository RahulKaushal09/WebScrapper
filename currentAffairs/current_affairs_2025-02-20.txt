RESILIENT TELECOM INFRASTRUCTURE
Mains – GS2 & GS 3
The Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), a multilateral organisation launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019, put out a report earlier this month studying Indian telecom networks’ preparedness in the event of disasters.
Telecom networks are crucial to handling disasters, because they allow the State and National Disaster Management Authorities to communicate quickly with local municipalities and the State and Union governments
Telecom networks are particularly vulnerable, as they comprise cabling that may not be fully underground, towers that may not be able to withstand high wind speeds, and because they rely on a steady flow of electricity, which is frequently disrupted by disasters.
Coastal regions face elevated risks, as that is where undersea cables connect India with the global internet. If the landing stations of these cables are impacted, there can be massive network disruptions.
What can be done?
Since much of the disruption is attributable to power failures, much can be accomplished during a disaster by maintaining or restoring power supply to telecom towers and the network operating centres to which they’re connected.
Telecom operators have typically never deployed towers assuming 24/7 power supply — and have battery as well as fuel backup.
The CDRI report recommends a few measures to develop a resilient telecom network. These include greater data collection and more coordination among officials, a more robust power infrastructure, and requiring cell towers to withstand higher wind speeds, especially in districts where hurricanes make landfall.
The CDRI also advocates for a dig-once policy, which recommends building as much underground civil infrastructure, like water and gas supply lines, drainage and fibre optic cables simultaneously, reducing the risk of cables being damaged when other infrastructure is built.
The short- to medium-term roadmap suggests the need to update disaster damage and loss data format, mainstream disaster risk modelling into telecommunications infrastructure planning, strengthen telecommunications asset design based on local and regional hazard vulnerability profiles, the report says.
There are also commercial interventions that the report touches on. A key one is parametric insurance, a system where telecom operators are not left to bear the commercial burden of a disaster all by themselves, and are thus financially incentivised to bring networks back online rapidly (and presumably to nudge them to disaster-proof their infrastructure well enough to keep premiums down).

GLOBAL WARMING EXACERBATING WATER GAPS
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Water gaps amounting to nearly 458 billion cubic meters per year already exist. These are projected to increase by 6 per cent under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming and by 15 per cent under 3 degrees Celsius warming according to a new analysis published in Nature Communications.
The study emphasised on developing a more resilient and sustainable water management system to combat scarcity. This could include investing in resilient infrastructure, enhancing storage capabilities, desalination of seawater, reuse of treated wastewater and physical and virtual water transfers to distribute water from areas of abundance to areas of need.
Water gaps are defined as the difference between renewable water availability and water consumption while maintaining adequate flows in aquatic environments.
Researchers used climate outputs from climate models to quantify water gaps under baseline, 1.5°C, and 3°C warming scenarios.
Regions currently experiencing water gaps are expected to face more severe conditions under 1.5°C warming, with even worse outcomes at 3°C warming. This trend is particularly evident in the eastern US, Chile, the Mediterranean region, south and east India, and the North China Plain.
Additionally, some regions that were relatively unaffected in the baseline climate, such as Italy, Madagascar, and some US states on the East Coast (North Carolina and Virginia) and in the Great Lakes region (Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois), are projected to see worsening conditions.
Saudi Arabia is projected to experience decreased water scarcity under the 1.5°C warming scenario, but substantial increases in water gaps under the 3°C warming scenario.
Largest water gaps in India
The largest water gaps under the baseline climate are found in India, the United States, Pakistan, Iran and China.
India is projected to experience the most important increase in water gaps under warming scenarios. In a 1.5°C warmer climate, India will have an additional 11.1 km3/yr water gap.
Ganges-Brahmaputra basin imperilled
The analysis also looked at water gap trends in major hydrological basins. Under baseline climate conditions, the largest water gaps are found in the Ganges-Brahmaputra, Sabarmati, Tigris-Euphrates, Indus and Nile River basins.
Under 1.5°C warming conditions, water gaps are expected to increase the most in the Ganges-Brahmaputra, Godavari and Mississippi-Missouri river basins, while water gaps are expected to decrease in the Sabarmati, Columbia and northwestern United States and Nile basins.
In a 3°C warmer climate, the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin still presents the largest water gap increase compared to baseline conditions, followed by the Indus, Mississippi-Missouri, China Coast, Godavari and Tigris-Euphrates basins.

**********What is Nuclear Fusion?
A world record for nuclear fusion has been smashed after the WEST Tokamak reactor, in southern France, was able to maintain plasma for more than 22 minutes.
About Nuclear Fusion:
Nuclear fusion is the process by which
two light atomic nuclei combine to form a single heavier one
while
releasing massive amounts of energy.
The process releases energy because the total mass of the resulting single nucleus is less than the mass of the two original nuclei. The leftover mass becomes energy.
Fusion reactions
take place in a state of matter called plasma
— a hot, charged gas made of positive ions and free-moving electrons with unique properties distinct from solids, liquids or gases.
sun
, along with all
other stars, is powered by this reaction.
What are Tokamaks?
The devices designated for the task of doing this here on Earth—n
uclear fusion reactors — are called tokamaks.
Tokamaks are often also
called 'artificial suns'
due to the fact that these doughnut-shaped machines replicate processes that occur in the sun.
There are
currently over 200 tokamaks in operation across the globe
with the scientific milestones achieved in these devices developing a roadmap for the operation of the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER,
world's largest fusion experiment.
A commercial tokamak will
aim to use the thermal energy of plasma heated by fusion to heat water,
create steam, and, in turn, spin a turbine that generates electricity.
Fusion can involve many different elements in the periodic table. However,
researchers
working on fusion energy applications
are especially interested in deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion.
DT fusion produces a neutron and a helium nucleus. In the process, it also releases much more energy than most fusion.
Advantages of Nuclear Fusion:
produces more energy than fission
Fusion could generate four times more energy per kilogram of fuel than fission (used in nuclear power plants) and nearly four million times more energy than burning oil or coal.
It also
doesn’t produce radioactive byproducts
that need to be stored or harmful carbon emissions; it simply produces inert helium and a neutron.
Unlimited Fuel Supply:
to make fusion happen
is simply heavy hydrogen atoms,
which can be found in something that Earth has in abundance: seawater. No mining of uranium is required.
It is much safer than nuclear fission, since fusion
can’t create runaway reactions.

**********India to Enhance Economic Data Tracking with Monthly Labour Surveys, Revised IIP Schedule, and Private Capex Report
Why in news?
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is set to enhance the frequency and timeliness of key macroeconomic data releases, introducing a
private sector capex survey
monthly labour force reports
, and a
revised schedule for the factory output data
from 2025-25 (FY26).
What’s in today’s article?
Revised Factory Output Data Release Schedule
Private Capex Survey to be Released in April
Monthly Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) to Begin in May
To enhance timeliness, the
Index of Industrial Production (IIP)
data will now be released on the 28th of every month instead of the 12th, reducing the reporting lag from 42 days to around a month.
The all-India IIP measures short-term changes in industrial production relative to a base period.
It serves as a key indicator of industrial activity, released monthly, and is crucial for calculating the manufacturing sector's Gross Value Added (GVA) in GDP on a quarterly basis.
This adjustment will ensure factory output data aligns more closely with other economic indicators like retail inflation, aiding better policymaking by the government and RBI.
The survey will track capex expenditure over the past three years and projected investments for 2024-25 and 2025-26.
It will also provide a sector-wise and asset-wise breakdown, offering insights into industries likely to attract major investments.
Importance of private capex
Private capex can lead to economic growth by increasing demand and income over time.
It can also increase employment and growth by funding projects like roads, railways, and housing.
Private capex can also lead to higher corporate profits.
Assessing Private Sector Investment Intentions
MoSPI will release a new survey on April 30, 2025 to measure capital investment intentions in the private corporate sector, covering both financial and non-financial enterprises.
To meet the growing demand for timely labour market insights, MoSPI will start releasing monthly
PLFS reports
for rural and urban areas from May.
Data for the previous month will be published on the 15th of each month, while quarterly PLFS reports will be released a month after the quarter ends.
Back Series and Data Comparability
A back series for at least the past 12 months will be introduced, adjusted for higher standard error due to smaller sample sizes in the monthly survey.
Significance of PLFS and Current Releases
The PLFS, launched in 2017 by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), provides key labour indicators such as Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), Worker Population Ratio (WPR), Unemployment Rate (UR).
Currently, rural PLFS data is released annually, while urban PLFS data is published quarterly, along with an annual combined report.
Other employment surveys, like survey by the
Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)
, are released on a weekly and monthly basis.

PACL (Pearl Agro Corporation Limited) Scam:
Collected Rs 49,100 crore from investors under the guise of land investments.
Regulation
In India, Ponzi schemes are illegal under the
Prize Chit and Money Circulation (Banning) Act, 1978
, which prohibits promoting or participating in money circulation schemes.
Additionally, the
Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act, 2019
explicitly bans Ponzi schemes, further strengthening legal action against such frauds.
SEBI & RBI
regulate financial institutions to curb such frauds.
The MPID Act was enacted to protect investors from fraudulent financial establishments that collect deposits with false promises of high returns and then default on payments.
Reason for Enactment
During the 1990s, several financial firms in Maharashtra defrauded middle-class and poor investors, leading to widespread financial losses and public outrage.
Need for Legislative Action
With deposit scams running into crores, protests and law-and-order issues emerged, particularly in Mumbai, India’s financial hub.
To curb such fraudulent activities, the Maharashtra government introduced the MPID Act, which received Presidential assent in January, 2000.
Accountability and Punishment
Any financial establishment that fraudulently defaults on deposit repayments, including promised interest or benefits, is liable under the Act.
Promoters, directors, partners, managers, and employees responsible for such defaults can be held accountable.
If found guilty, they may face imprisonment of up to
six years
and a
fine of up to Rs 1 lakh
Attachment of Assets
The government can
attach money or property
suspected to be acquired through fraudulent financial activities.
The court has the power to make the
attachment order absolute
and direct the
The proceeds from the sale are then
equitably distributed among depositors
Significance of the Act
Unlike general fraud provisions in criminal law, the MPID Act provides a
faster mechanism
for attachment and distribution of assets, ensuring quicker relief for depositors.
Bombay High Court's Initial Verdict (2005)
It ruled the MPID Act
unconstitutional
, stating that it conflicted with central laws such as the Companies Act, 1956, and the RBI Act, 1934.
Supreme Court’s Decision (2011 & 2022)
The Supreme Court
upheld the constitutional validity

**********Significance of Building Resilient Telecom Infrastructure
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context)
Resilient Telecom Infra (Need, Challenges, Solutions, Future Roadmap, etc.)
Introduction:
India’s telecom infrastructure plays a
critical role in disaster response
, ensuring uninterrupted communication for emergency services and the public.
However, natural calamities such as
cyclones, earthquakes, and floods
pose a severe threat to these networks.
The
Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)
, a global initiative launched by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019, recently released a report analysing India’s telecom preparedness for disasters.
The findings emphasize the
vulnerabilities in telecom networks
and outline key measures to enhance
resilience, power stability, and rapid recovery
during emergencies.
Importance of Resilient Telecom Infrastructure:
Telecom networks are essential for
disaster management
as they enable quick communication between:
National Disaster Management Authorities (NDMA)
and local administrations.
Emergency services and citizens in affected areas.
State and central governments to coordinate relief efforts.
However, telecom networks are
highly vulnerable
due to their dependency on
above-ground cables, tower strength, and electricity supply
. A natural disaster can severely
disrupt services
, affecting rescue operations and public communication.
Key Challenges in Disaster-Prone Areas:
High Risk in Coastal and Seismic Zones
Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable as
undersea cables
connect India to global internet networks.
Earthquakes and cyclones can
damage telecom towers
, leading to massive service outages.
Power Failures: The Biggest Issue
Telecom towers rely heavily on
uninterrupted power supply
, but disasters often cause prolonged blackouts.
Lack of electricity
delays network restoration
, making it difficult for operators to bring services back online.
Structural Weakness of Telecom Towers
Many towers are
not built to withstand high wind speeds
, especially in coastal states.
Poorly planned
overhead cables snap easily
during storms, leading to service breakdowns.
Solutions for Building a Disaster-Resilient Telecom Network:
Strengthening Power Infrastructure
Ensuring
to critical telecom sites.
Reserving fuel stocks
for emergency use at telecom towers.
Installing
solar or hybrid power solutions
to reduce dependency on the grid.
Building Stronger Telecom Towers
Mandating
higher wind resistance standards
for towers in cyclone-prone areas.
Elevating diesel generators at tower sites to prevent flood-related failures.
Underground Fiber Optic Cables and Dig-Once Policy
Overhead telecom cables often snap in extreme weather. The report recommends shifting to
underground fiber optic cables
wherever possible.
Implementing a
"dig-once" policy
, where underground cables are laid
alongside other infrastructure
like water and gas pipelines, reducing repeated disruptions.
Better Disaster Monitoring and Response
Real-time tracking of
telecom asset damage
using
software and AI-driven data collection
Emergency fuel distribution to keep towers operational.
Collaboration between the
Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and telecom operators
to ensure
rapid damage assessment and restoration
Financial Resilience through Parametric Insurance
The report highlights
parametric insurance
as a key financial tool.
This ensures that telecom operators
receive compensation quickly
after a disaster, enabling
faster network restoration
Future Roadmap for Telecom Resilience in India:
Short-Term Initiatives (1-2 years)
backup power systems
real-time damage monitoring
through software tools.
Upgrading telecom infrastructure in
high-risk coastal and seismic areas
Medium-Term Initiatives (3-5 years)
Nationwide shift towards
underground fiber optic networks
Mandatory
disaster-proofing of new telecom towers
Creating
a coordinated response mechanism
for telecom outages.
Long-Term Vision (Beyond 5 years)
Achieving a
100% disaster-resilient telecom infrastructure
across India.
Developing
policy frameworks for telecom disaster preparedness
at national and state levels.
Increasing investment in
climate-resilient infrastructure
through public-private partnerships.
Conclusion:
India’s telecom infrastructure is
essential for disaster response
, but it remains
highly vulnerable to natural calamities
The CDRI report highlights the
urgent need for structural upgrades, power stability, underground fiber networks, and improved disaster coordination
By implementing these measures, India can ensure
minimal communication disruptions
during emergencies, enabling faster rescue operations and better crisis management.

**********The Emerging Rift in the West - Trump’s Policy Shift and Its Global Implications
Context:
The return of Donald Trump to the White House has marked
a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy
, particularly in its approach to
European security, global trade, and domestic political values.
Trump’s move to initiate
peace talks with Russia over Ukraine
and Vice President JD Vance’s
criticism of European democracies
at the Munich Security Conference has shocked America’s European allies.
The traditional unity of the “
Collective West
” now appears fragile, raising concerns about geopolitical realignments.
U.S.-Europe Divide Under Trump:
America’s changing stance on European security:
Trump’s direct negotiations with Russia
, bypassing Kyiv and Brussels, indicate a shift in U.S. commitment to Ukraine.
The expected Trump-Putin summit suggests an effort to
restore Russia’s influence in European security,
and bring Moscow back to “Western” institutions like the Group of Seven (
G7
).
Europe’s concerns over Trump’s reduced security commitments, which could
weaken
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (
NATO
Tensions over global trade and economic policies:
Trump seeks to
replace the existing trade order with bilateral trade deals
, arguing that the current system harms American workers.
The U.S. move to challenge international trade frameworks
may strain relations with European economies.
Domestic political differences:
Trump’s administration
opposes liberal values
such as open borders, climate change policies, and gender identity rights.
JD Vance’s speech in Munich criticized European efforts to sideline right-wing political parties.
Elon Musk’s support for European right-wing parties highlights
transnational conservative collaboration.
The West’s Historical Evolution and Current Crisis:
The formation of the modern West:
The West, traditionally bound by liberal values like
capitalism, democracy, and individual rights
, has seen
internal conflicts
throughout history.
The unity
of the West since World War II was primarily due to the
fear of communism
and the Soviet Union’s expansionist policies.
The U.S.-led global order
was built through institutions like NATO, the United Nations, the IMF, and the World Bank.
The rise of the ‘Conservative International’ (Con-intern):
The ideological rift within the West is not just about the U.S.-Europe policy differences but also
a broader conservative pushback against liberal dominance
The emergence of a Con-intern
parallels earlier movements
like the Communist International (Comintern) and liberal internationalism.
The Con-intern may reshape global policies
on security, trade, and social issues.
Geopolitical Implications and India’s Stance:
Russia and China’s strategic advantage:
Moscow and Beijing
benefit from a divided West
and continue to exploit gaps in U.S. alliances.
Both nations seek to
negotiate separate deals with Washington
despite their anti-West rhetoric.
India’s pragmatic approach:
Unlike in the past, India is
no longer influenced by anti-Western propaganda
from Russia and China.
Delhi recognizes emerging contradictions within the West and aims to
engage strategically to protect its national interests.
India’s balancing act
between Western powers and emerging geopolitical shifts aligns with its broader foreign policy objectives.
Conclusion:
If President John F Kennedy said America must pay any price or bear any burden to lead the world, Trump and his followers are saying that the
cost and consequences of American leadership are no longer acceptable.
The perceived collapse of the “Collective West” is
reshaping global power dynamics
. Trump’s realignment of U.S. policies has widened the rift with Europe, emboldening Russia and China.
While uncertainties remain about the future of the U.S.-Europe relations,
India sees an opportunity to navigate this evolving landscape strategically.
Whether this divergence results in a complete realignment or merely a recalibration of existing ties remains to be seen.

Editorial Analysis
**********President’s Rule and the Road Ahead
Context
The
imposition of President’s Rule
in Manipur on February 13
marks a significant political development in India,
particularly considering the protracted violence that has gripped the state for over 21 months.
The decision, taken after the
resignation of Chief Minister N. Biren Singh
, underscores the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) strategic retreat rather than an outright resolution to the ongoing turmoil.
This
move highlights not only the limitations of the double-engine sarkar but also raises broader concerns
about governance, state legitimacy, and institutional trust in Manipur.
The Consequence of the Prolonged Crisis:
Erosion of Trust and Legitimacy in the State
One of the most critical
consequences of the
prolonged crisis has been the erosion of citizens' trust
in the state and its institutions.
Reports suggest that the
Manipur government under Biren Singh played a partisan role
, aligning with Meitei ultranationalist sentiments.
favouritism has fractured the shared territorial space
and contributed to deeper communal divisions.
recent forensic report
linking Singh to inflammatory rhetoric
further tarnishes the credibility of the state machinery.
Given this backdrop,
President’s Rule is a necessary intervention,
but it is not a sufficient measure to restore normalcy.
Challenges to State Power and Restoring Governance in Manipur
Erosion of State Authority and Legitimacy
One of the most fundamental challenges facing governance in Manipur is the
erosion of the state’s authority.
concept of ‘infrastructural power,’
as described by political sociologist Michael Mann, refers to a state's capacity to implement policies and maintain effective control over its territory.
In Manipur
, this power has been significantly weakened due to the state’s perceived bias
in handling the ongoing ethnic violence.
For governance to be effectively restored,
the state must work toward re-establishing its infrastructural power
by demonstrating neutrality and enforcing the law without bias.
Politicisation of Law Enforcement and Administrative Machinery
A significant challenge in restoring order is the
politicisation of the law enforcement agencies and the administrative machinery.
Manipur police and security forces have been accused of taking sides in the conflict
, either through inaction or direct complicity with certain groups.
Law enforcement agencies are seen as extensions of political or ethnic factions
rather than as neutral enforcers of justice.
Different communities perceive that the
state favours one group over another, which further fuels resentment and violence.
To overcome this challenge, the central government must ensure that security forces operate
without political interference
and adhere strictly to constitutional principles.
The deployment of neutral agencies such as the
Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF)
under direct federal supervision could help rebuild public confidence in law enforcement.
Failure to Maintain Neutrality and the Rise of Majoritarian Narratives
One of the most dangerous developments in Manipur’s crisis has been the rise of
majoritarian nationalist narratives
, which have exacerbated tensions between communities.
The state government under N. Biren Singh has been accused of adopting a populist,
Meitei-majoritarian
approach, which has alienated other ethnic groups, particularly the
Kuki-Zomi-Hmar tribes
This aligns with the broader critique of majoritarian politics, where dominant groups attempt to
rewrite history and redefine national identity
at the expense of marginalized communities.
The challenge for the BJP-led central government is to
reverse this trend
and ensure that governance in Manipur is
inclusive, representative, and impartial
The Debate on Manipur’s Administrative Structure
One of the proposed solutions to address Manipur’s political turmoil is to
declare it a ‘hill state,’ which could potentially neutralise demands
for a separate administration by the Kuki-Zomi-Hmar groups.
However,
such a move must be carefully evaluated for its constitutional implications, particularly concerning Article 371C
, which provides special provisions for Manipur’s hill areas.
Any attempt to dilute these protective
measures could exacerbate tensions and further alienate tribal communities.
Additionally,
the push to centralise power under President’s Rule raises concerns about its potential misuse
to advance a majoritarian agenda.
While national unity is often invoked as a justification for such centralisation,
a failure to recognise and respect the distinct identities of Manipur’s hill and valley communities could be counterproductive.
The risk is that it may instead strengthen the call for a separate administration among Kuki-Zomi-Hmar groups rather than quell the unrest.
The Way Ahead: Ensuring Equitable Representation and Power Distribution
long-term solution
to Manipur’s crisis lies in
decentralisation rather than centralisation.
President’s Rule period should be used to conduct a thorough institutional audit
to address existing gaps in political representation, resource distribution, and governance.
Marginalised communities must be given a voice in decision-making processes
, and meaningful autonomy must be devolved to tribal regions to ensure a fair balance of power.
History has shown that
when institutions fail to represent and protect diverse communities equitably, democracy deficits emerge,
leading to recurring cycles of violence and instability.
Thus,
the state must recalibrate its governance structures to strengthen constitutional protections
for all groups, rather than dissolving them in the name of national unity.
Conclusion
in Manipur represents
both a challenge and an opportunity.
While it provides a temporary mechanism to stabilise the region,
it also exposes the limitations of the BJP’s governance model and the fragility of state institutions
in the face of ethnic and political conflict.
To achieve lasting peace,
the government must go beyond mere law-and-order approaches and work toward fostering genuine trust and legitimacy through equitable governance
, fair representation, and adherence to constitutional principles.

Editorial Analysis
**********Manipur’s Worsening Humanitarian Crisis
Context
The
India-Myanmar borderlands have long been a region of geopolitical significance
, yet they remain critically under-researched, particularly concerning the ongoing humanitarian crises.
Manipur conflict, characterised by armed violence
, displacement, and resource scarcity, has
created severe humanitarian challenges.
However,
restricted access, security concerns, and a lack of comprehensive data collection have obscured the true extent
of these crises.
Therefore,
it is important to critically examine the implications of these information gaps, the humanitarian challenges faced by displaced populations,
and the urgent measures required to alleviate their suffering.
The Crisis of Data Deficiency and Displacement in the Manipur Conflict
Fragmented and Incomplete Data Collection
The official estimates suggest that
approximately 58,000 individuals have been displaced
and are residing in relief camps across Manipur's Valley and Hill districts.
these numbers fail to account for several categories of displaced persons
. Many individuals remain unregistered because they are living with relatives, staying in temporary shelters, or have relocated across multiple locations.
Furthermore
, those who have fled the state due to conflict-related circumstances, seeking safety,
employment, or education, are largely unrecorded.
This
incomplete data collection creates a ‘zone of the unknown,’
where the full extent of displacement remains underestimated.
During the peak of the conflict,
an estimated 12,000 people fled to Mizoram, while around 7,000 sought refuge in Nagaland
, Assam, and Meghalaya.
Yet, due to fragmented and inconsistent data collection methods,
these figures may not accurately reflect the true magnitude of displacement.
Many displaced individuals may not be officially documented by government agencies or humanitarian organisations, making it difficult
to assess their immediate needs or provide adequate support.
Physical Segregation and Breakdown of Information Channels
A significant factor contributing to the data deficiency is
the physical separation of the Meitei and Kuki-Zomi communities,
which has led to the collapse of shared information channels.
In times of conflict,
when communities are divided along ethnic lines, obtaining accurate and unbiased data becomes a challenge.
conflict has led to the forced segregation of populations
, with Meitei and Kuki-Zomi individuals relocating to areas dominated by their respective ethnic groups.
separation has resulted in a communication gap
, as each group primarily relies on its own community networks for information.
Consequently,
official reports may reflect only a partial reality,
as they fail to incorporate the lived experiences of all affected groups.
Another overlooked category of displaced persons includes thousands of Manipuri youth
who have left the state in search of
better education and job opportunities.
Given the economic instability and ongoing violence,
many young people have migrated to urban centres in other parts of India
, seeking a more stable future.
Similarly, individuals with chronic
health conditions have been forced to leave Manipur in search of medical care.
However, b
ecause these individuals are not residing in relief camps, their displacement is often not counted
in official records.
Challenges in Tracking Humanitarian Needs
The lack of comprehensive data has serious implications
for humanitarian aid distribution and policy-making.
Relief efforts are often based on official figures
, meaning that unregistered displaced persons may be excluded from essential services such as food distribution, healthcare, and shelter assistance.
absence of systematic documentation also results in the underreporting of key humanitarian concerns
, including mortality rates, malnutrition, and disease outbreaks in relief camps.
Moreover,
misinformation and disinformation further complicate an empirical understanding of the conflict.
Without verified data,
rumours and politically motivated narratives shape public perceptions
, influencing both government responses and humanitarian interventions.
The lack of transparency also means that resources may be allocated inefficiently
, with certain regions receiving disproportionate attention while others remain neglected.
Some Other Aspects of Manipur Crisis
Health and Humanitarian Concerns
One of the most alarming consequences of the conflict is the
deterioration of healthcare accessibility.
In Kuki-Zomi-dominated hill districts,
major tertiary healthcare centres in Imphal are no longer accessible
, forcing residents to seek medical treatment via circuitous routes through Mizoram and Nagaland.
This has led to prolonged travel times for patients,
resulting in preventable deaths and worsening health conditions.
Documented cases highlight the severity of this crisis. For instance, a 63-year-old displaced individual in Kangpokpi district died due to a lack of dialysis facilities
, while a mother in Churachandpur lost her life from postpartum haemorrhage in a relief camp
Mental Health Issues
psychological toll is equally severe
, with studies showing that 65.8% of displaced individuals in Imphal East suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and many others experience moderate to severe anxiety.
worsening mental health conditions have led to a rise in suicides
among displaced individuals.
The Humanitarian Crisis in Relief Camps
Despite the establishment of relief camps more than two years ago,
basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter remain largely inadequate.
With over 22,000 children still living in camps,
the lack of educational access has exacerbated long-term developmental challenges.
Additionally, deteriorating living conditions,
including daily water shortages, poor sanitation, and food insecurity, have further intensified the humanitarian crisis.
Economic instability has compounded these challenges.
Conflict-induced inflation has increased the cost of essential goods
, making it difficult for displaced populations to secure necessary supplies.
As donor fatigue sets in and resources dwindle,
the sustainability of relief efforts remains a critical concern.
Recommendations for Humanitarian Intervention
Increased External Humanitarian Support:
Private and corporate social responsibility (CSR) entities should step in to provide aid, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive adequate resources.
Improving Water Accessibility:
With a significant portion of household incomes being spent on obtaining water from private sources, government and aid agencies must prioritize clean water distribution.
Establishing Humanitarian Corridors:
Emergency medical evacuation corridors should be set up to facilitate the safe transfer of critically ill patients from conflict-affected areas to hospitals.
Restoring Supply Chains:
Essential commodities, including food and medical supplies, must be transported between valley and hill districts through neutral communities to ease inflationary pressures and ensure equitable resource distribution.
Conclusion
Manipur conflict has resulted in an acute humanitarian crisis
, exacerbated by data deficiencies, displacement, and healthcare inaccessibility.
While violence may have subsided in some areas,
forced displacement continues to threaten the livelihoods and well-being of thousands.
Without immediate intervention
, the situation will further deteriorate,
disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, particularly children and the elderly.
Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from government agencies, humanitarian organizations,
and civil society to restore stability and provide relief to those most in need.

**********[20th February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Manipur’s worsening humanitarian crisis
Polity
PYQ Relevance:
) How far are India’s internal security challenges linked with border management particularly in view of the long porous borders with most countries of South Asia and Myanmar?
(2013)
Q)
If a particular area is brought under the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of India, which one of the following statements best reflects the consequence of it?
(CSP 2022)
(a) This would prevent the transfer of land of tribal people to non-tribal people.
(b) This would create a local self-governing body in that area.
(c) This would convert that area into a Union Territory.
(d) The State having such areas would be declared a Special Category State.
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
internal security challenges linked with border management (2013),
Fifth Schedule (2022).
The India-Myanmar borderlands lack reliable data despite ongoing conflicts and crises. In Manipur, restricted access and security issues make it hard to document humanitarian needs. Misinformation worsens the situation. Around 58,000 people live in relief camps, while 12,000 fled to Mizoram and 7,000 to Nagaland, Assam, and Meghalaya. Data collection remains fragmented.
Today’s editorial discusses issues related to Manipur, which are relevant for GS Paper 3 (Mains) under the Security section.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
The Manipur conflict is complex, and security issues make it hard to access certain areas leads to major gaps in tracking humanitarian needs.
How has the complexity of the conflict contributed to significant gaps in documenting humanitarian needs?
Restricted Access and Security Concerns:
The conflict’s complexity leads to restricted access for humanitarian organizations and data collectors due to security risks.
Example:
Adverse security conditions hinder the ability to thoroughly assess needs in certain areas.
Breakdown of Information Chains:
The physical and social separation of communities (like the Meitei and Kuki-Zomi) disrupts the flow of accurate information.
The separation makes it difficult to get a comprehensive understanding of the needs of both communities, as information does not flow freely between them.
Unaccounted Populations:
Official counts often only consider those in registered relief camps, overlooking unregistered individuals living with relatives, in temporary shelters, or displaced across multiple locations.
Many individuals displaced outside of registered camps or those who have left the State entirely are not included in official estimates, leading to underreporting.
Altered Healthcare Access and Documentation:
The conflict changes how people seek medical care, especially in conflicted regions, making it difficult to track health-related issues.
Residents of Kuki-Zomi-dominated hill districts can no longer easily access major hospitals in Imphal, leading to indirect routes and potentially undocumented health crises.
Misinformation and Disinformation:
The spread of inaccurate information clouds the true picture, making it difficult to form an empirical understanding of the conflict’s impact.
The text mentions that misinformation and disinformation cloud an empirical understanding of the conflict.
Why do the India-Myanmar borderlands remain a data-deficient region despite their long history of armed conflict, displacement, and humanitarian crises?
Challenging Geography:
The region’s complex topography, characterized by rugged mountains and dense forests, complicates access for data collection efforts. For example, the difficult terrain has hindered the effective implementation of border initiatives such as fencing, which has faced significant logistical challenges over the years.
Inadequate Infrastructure:
There is a lack of basic infrastructure, including roads and communication networks, which impedes the movement of researchers and humanitarian workers.
Moreh Integrated Check Post (ICP) in Manipur
, intended to facilitate trade and connectivity, has experienced slow construction and inadequate facilities, reflecting broader infrastructural deficiencies in the region.
Political Sensitivities:
The presence of various insurgent groups and ongoing conflicts creates a volatile environment that discourages data collection. Security concerns often prevent researchers and NGOs from engaging with local communities to gather necessary information on humanitarian needs.
Shared Ethnic Ties and Cross-Border Dynamics:
The interconnectedness of ethnic communities across the border complicates the situation further. Policies such as the cancellation of the Free Regime Movement (FMR) agreement have disrupted traditional social networks, making it difficult to assess the socio-economic conditions on both sides effectively.
Restricted Access for Humanitarian Organizations:
Government-imposed restrictions and logistical challenges prevent humanitarian agencies from collecting and reporting crucial data.
After Myanmar’s 2021 military coup, aid organizations faced severe restrictions in conflict-hit areas like the Sagaing Region, resulting in major data gaps on displacement and food insecurity.
Why does Manipur need a shift towards ‘greater common good’ politics?
Ethnic Divisions and Communal Tensions:
The conflict between the Meitei and Kuki-Zomi communities has created deep mistrust and segregation, making governance difficult. A politics of “greater common good” would prioritize reconciliation and collective welfare over ethnic identity-based politics.
Humanitarian Crisis and Governance Failures:
Prolonged displacement, lack of adequate relief measures, and deteriorating healthcare require governance focused on inclusive development rather than ethnic-based power struggles.
Over 58,000 displaced individuals are still in relief camps, struggling with food, water, and medical shortages due to lack of coordinated efforts.
Economic and Social Stability:
Manipur’s economic potential is hindered by violence, blockades, and an unstable law-and-order situation. A governance approach focused on the “greater common good” would foster investment, economic recovery, and social stability.
What are the steps taken by the Indian Government?
Imposition of President’s Rule:
On February 13, 2025, Manipur was placed under President’s Rule following the resignation of Chief Minister. This decision was made due to nearly two years of ethnic violence and political turmoil that had resulted in over 250 deaths and widespread unrest.
Suspension of the State Assembly:
The state assembly has been put under suspended animation, which means it will not function until the situation stabilizes. This is the 11th instance of President’s Rule being imposed in Manipur since its statehood.
Security Measures:
The central government has directed security forces to take all necessary steps to restore order in Manipur. This includes deploying additional military and paramilitary forces to manage the fragile security situation, which has seen recent escalations in violence.
Appointment of a Security Advisor:
Following the invocation of Article 355 of the Indian Constitution, a security advisor was appointed to assist the Chief Minister in managing law and order.
Investigation into Violence:
The Ministry of Home Affairs has handed over important cases related to the violence to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for effective investigation, indicating a commitment to addressing the root causes of the unrest.
Way forward:
Inclusive Dialogue and Reconciliation:
Establish a truth and reconciliation commission involving all ethnic communities to foster trust, address grievances, and create a roadmap for long-term peace and stability.
Sustainable Development and Governance Reforms:
Focus on infrastructure development, livelihood generation, and transparent governance to ensure equitable growth, reduce ethnic tensions, and rebuild public confidence in state institutions.
**********On building resilient telecom infrastructure
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Telecom sector;
Why in the News?
The Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), a global organization launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019, recently released a report assessing how well Indian telecom networks can handle disasters.
What does the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure report state?
Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment:
The report conducted a comprehensive risk assessment across 0.77 million telecom towers, evaluating vulnerabilities to various disasters such as floods, cyclones, and earthquakes, which informs infrastructure planning and resilience strategies.
Disaster Risk and Resilience Index:
A new index was developed to assess the vulnerability of telecom infrastructure based on factors like disaster intensity and frequency, enabling targeted risk management efforts.
Technical and Governance Enhancements:
Recommendations include improving technical planning and design of telecom infrastructure to withstand disasters, as well as integrating disaster resilience into sectoral policies through risk-informed governance.
Financial Instruments and Collaboration:
The report advocates for establishing risk-sharing mechanisms to protect telecom operators financially, alongside promoting cross-sectoral collaboration for coordinated disaster response efforts.
Last-Mile Connectivity and Digital Solutions:
Emphasizing the importance of inclusive emergency responses, the report calls for enhancing last-mile connectivity and leveraging digital solutions to ensure rapid service restoration during crises.
Why do telecom networks face elevated risks in coastal regions in times of disaster and calamity?
High Exposure to Cyclones & Storm Surges:
Coastal areas frequently experience
high-speed winds
storm surges
, which can damage telecom towers and disrupt communication.
Example:
During Cyclone Amphan (2020), telecom networks in West Bengal and Odisha were severely impacted due to tower collapses and flooding.
Vulnerability of Undersea Cable Landing Stations:
Undersea cables connect India to global internet infrastructure, and their
landing stations
are located in coastal regions. Damage to these stations can cause widespread
internet outages
In 2023, a disruption in undersea cables near the Red Sea affected internet speeds in South Asia, including India.
Power Failures Due to Flooding & Infrastructure Damage:
Coastal disasters often lead to
massive power outages
, affecting telecom towers and network operating centres that rely on continuous electricity.
During Cyclone Tauktae (2021), heavy rainfall and flooding in Mumbai led to prolonged telecom disruptions due to power cuts and submerged backup generators.
Why are undersea cables better than overland cables?
Higher Capacity:
Undersea cables can carry vast amounts of data, with total capacities reaching terabits per second, significantly surpassing the capabilities of satellite communications, which typically offer much lower bandwidth (around 1 gigabit per second).
Lower Latency:
The signal transmission time is considerably shorter with undersea cables than with satellite links. For example, latency over a fibre submarine cable is around 120 milliseconds, while satellite communications can introduce delays of approximately 650 milliseconds due to the long distances signals must travel to and from space.
Cost-Effectiveness:
Laying undersea cables is generally more economical than deploying satellite systems for large-scale data transmission. The initial investment in submarine cables, while significant, is offset by their capacity and reliability, making them a more sustainable option for long-term infrastructure.
Reliability and Stability:
Undersea cables are less susceptible to environmental factors that can disrupt overland cables, such as weather conditions or physical damage from construction activities. Their placement on the seabed provides a level of protection against many potential hazards.
Global Connectivity:
Submarine cables are essential for connecting continents and regions that are separated by water. They facilitate international data traffic and play a critical role in global communications, making them indispensable for the functioning of the Internet and other communication networks.
Does power failure create major problems?
Disrupts Communication During Emergencies:
Telecom towers and network operating centres
require continuous power
to function. When electricity is cut off, mobile networks and internet services fail,
hindering disaster response
During Cyclone Fani (2019), Odisha experienced massive power outages, causing mobile networks to shut down, and delaying rescue operations.
Limits Functionality of Backup Systems:
Most telecom towers rely on

**********Why global sea ice cover has dipped to record low — what this means
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of climate change;
Why in the News?
Between February 8 and 13, the total area of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic shrank to 15.76 million sq km, breaking the previous record low of 15.93 million sq km from early 2023, according to a BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).
What are the reasons for the record low?
Warm Air and Ocean Temperatures:
Elevated air and sea temperatures have significantly contributed to the melting of both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. Warmer conditions, particularly towards the end of summer, have led to increased melting rates, especially in the Antarctic region.
Wind Patterns:
Changes in atmospheric dynamics, including stronger westerly winds associated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), have disrupted sea ice formation and stability. In the Antarctic, these winds can break apart ice more easily due to its thinner and more mobile nature compared to the thicker Arctic ice.
Delayed Freezing:
In the Arctic, a delayed freezing process around regions like Hudson Bay has occurred due to unusually warm ocean temperatures, preventing the formation of new ice during winter.
Increased Freshwater Input:
The melting of glaciers and ice shelves adds freshwater to the oceans, which can alter ocean stratification and impact sea ice formation. While freshwater can initially encourage sea ice growth in some contexts, it also leads to changes that may ultimately reduce overall sea ice extent.
Feedback Mechanisms:
The loss of sea ice creates feedback loops that further exacerbate warming. As less ice remains to reflect sunlight, more solar radiation is absorbed by the ocean, leading to increased temperatures and further melting of ice.
What does “dip” mean?
In the context of the recent report on sea ice, the term “dip” refers to a significant decrease or reduction in the extent of sea ice coverage. Specifically, it denotes the record low measurement of combined Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, which fell to
15.76 million square kilometres,
marking a decline from previous levels.
This
highlights the
alarming trend of diminishing sea ice
, which is crucial for regulating global temperatures and maintaining ecological balance in polar regions.
What could be its impact?
Accelerated Global Warming:
Less sea ice means more ocean water is exposed to sunlight, absorbing heat instead of reflecting it.
Example:
The Arctic is warming nearly
four times faster
than the global average, leading to extreme weather patterns worldwide.
Disruptions in Ocean Currents:
Melting sea ice releases freshwater into the ocean, reducing salinity and slowing down deep-water circulation.
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which influences global climate patterns, is weakening due to increased freshwater from melting Arctic ice.
Threat to Marine Ecosystems:
Sea ice loss affects marine species dependent on stable ice conditions for survival.
Polar bears
rely on sea ice for hunting seals. As ice declines, they face starvation and habitat loss. Similarly, krill populations in Antarctica, a key food source for whales and penguins, are declining due to changing ice conditions.
More Extreme Weather Events:
Changes in polar ice influence atmospheric circulation, leading to unpredictable weather.
The weakening of the polar vortex due to Arctic warming has been linked to severe cold waves in
North America and Europe
, such as the
Texas winter storm in 2021
Coastal and Infrastructure Damage:
Rising temperatures due to ice melt contribute to permafrost thawing, which destabilizes infrastructure in polar regions.
Siberia, Russia
, thawing permafrost has caused buildings and roads to collapse, posing a major economic and environmental challenge.
What measures have been taken at the international level?
International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation (2025):
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UNESCO have declared 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation. This initiative aims to raise awareness about the importance of glaciers and ice sheets, which store a significant portion of the world’s freshwater, and to promote actions to mitigate their melting.
Global Cryosphere Watch:
The WMO’s Global Cryosphere Watch network, which includes scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has been actively monitoring and reporting on cryosphere changes. Their findings highlight alarming trends in ice loss and emphasize the need for immediate action to address these issues.
Collaborative Research Initiatives:
Various international scientific collaborations are underway to study and model the impacts of climate change on sea ice. These efforts involve researchers from multiple countries working together to gather data, analyze trends, and develop strategies for adaptation and mitigation.
Climate Action Frameworks:
Global climate agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, encourage countries to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which are a primary driver of climate change affecting sea ice.
Public Awareness Campaigns:
International organizations are engaging in campaigns to educate the public about the significance of sea ice and glaciers in regulating global climate systems.
Way forward:
Strengthening Climate Mitigation Efforts:
Nations must enhance commitments under the
by accelerating
renewable energy adoption
, and implementing
carbon pricing mechanisms
to curb global warming.
Enhancing Polar and Oceanic Monitoring:
international collaboration
for real-time satellite monitoring, expand
scientific research on polar ice dynamics
adaptive strategies
to protect vulnerable ecosystems and coastal communities.
Mains PYQ:
How do the melting of the Arctic ice and glaciers of the Antarctic differently affect the weather patterns and human activities on the Earth? Explain.

**********New study challenges the age of Saturn’s Rings
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
A new study has challenged previous assumptions, suggesting that
Saturn’s rings could be as old as the Solar System (~4.5 billion years old)
About Saturn and Its Rings
Saturn, the
sixth planet from the Sun
, is famous for its
iconic ring system
, made up of
billions of ice and rock particles
ranging in size from tiny grains to massive chunks.
It is primarily composed of
water ice (95%)
, with some dust and rocky debris.
The rings are divided into
seven main sections (A to G)
, with gaps like the
Cassini Division
Scientists have debated whether the rings
formed with Saturn (~4.5 billion years ago)
or if they are
only 100-400 million years old
Over time, tiny space rocks should darken the rings, yet they remain surprisingly bright.
Key Findings of the Study:
Earlier estimates, based on
Cassini data
, suggested the rings were
because they looked
clean and bright
The new study suggests that
micrometeoroid collisions remove dust efficiently
, preventing the rings from darkening over time.
High-speed micrometeoroid impacts (~108,000 km/h) cause dust to vaporize
, rather than accumulate.
The vaporized dust either
escapes Saturn’s gravity, falls into the planet’s atmosphere, or gets ejected into space
, keeping the rings
pristine
100 million years ago
, the Solar System was stable, making
ring formation unlikely
4 billion years ago
, the Solar System was chaotic, increasing the chances of
violent planetary collisions
that could have formed Saturn’s rings.
Various Missions to Saturn
Saturn has been explored by multiple spacecraft, each providing valuable insights into its
rings, atmosphere, and moons
1. Pioneer 11 (1979)
First spacecraft to
fly past Saturn

Iron Age; Important Sites
Why in the News?
Tamil Nadu CM recently proclaimed that the
Iron Age began on Tamil soil over 5,300 years ago (4th millennium BCE)
, based on findings from
Mayiladumparai, Sivagalai, Adichanallur, and Kilnamandi
.
The Iron Age in India was
initially thought to have begun around 700-600 BCE
Radiocarbon dating pushed the timeline back to
1800 BCE
, with evidence of iron smelting found in
Central Ganga Plain and Eastern Vindhyas
Recent discoveries in
suggest that
iron metallurgy was established in South India as early as 3300 BCE
Notable Iron Age Sites in India:
Central and Northern India
Raja Nala-ka-tila (UP)
Iron tools and slag
found in pre-NBP (Northern Black Polished) deposits
(1400–800 BCE)
Malhar (Chandauli, UP)
: Furnaces and iron slag indicate a major iron metallurgy center (1200 BCE).
Dadupur (UP)
: Large-scale iron smelting evidence dating back to 1000 BCE.
Hastinapur (UP)
: Iron tools associated with the Painted Grey Ware (PGW) culture (1000 BCE).
Takshashila (Punjab, Pakistan)
: Iron tools found in Gandhara settlements (800 BCE).
Western and Central India
Ahar (Rajasthan)
Chalcolithic culture (2500–1700 BCE)
showed early evidence of iron artifacts.
Naikund (Vidarbha, Maharashtra)
: Discovery of an iron smelting furnace (1000 BCE).
Mahurjhari (Nagpur, Maharashtra)
: Horse ornaments made of copper with iron knobs (800 BCE).
Paiyampalli (Tamil Nadu)
: Large-scale iron smelting and slag deposits (1200 BCE).
Adichanallur (Tamil Nadu)
: Iron tools and burial urns linked to Megalithic culture (1000 BCE).
Mayiladumparai (Tamil Nadu)
: Recent findings date iron usage to 3300 BCE, making it one of the oldest sites of iron metallurgy in India.
Sivagalai (Tamil Nadu)
: Iron artifacts and slag deposits, indicating early smelting practices (1100 BCE).
Iron Age in Tamil Nadu: New Discoveries
Earlier studies in
Mayiladumparai Excavation (2022)
suggested that the
Iron Age began 4,200 years ago (3rd millennium BCE)
This timeline
coincides with the Copper/Bronze Age in North India
, indicating a
technological divergence
between the regions.
The latest State Archaeology Department’s report, “Antiquity of Iron: Recent Radiometric Dates from Tamil Nadu
”
, confirms that
Iron smelting began as early as 3,345 BCE – 2,953 BCE
Limited availability of copper ores in South
India might have led to the
early adoption of iron technology
Excavations in
Sivagalai, Adichanallur, Kilnamandi, and Mayiladumparai
indicate that the
predates much of North India.

**********Nocturnal Bull Ants Navigate Using Polarized Moonlight
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Scientists at
Macquarie University, Sydney
, have discovered that
two species of nocturnal bull ants (Myrmecia pyriformis and Myrmecia midas)
rely on
polarised moonlight
for navigation.
What is Polarised Moonlight?
Polarised moonlight refers to
moonlight that has undergone scattering in Earth’s atmosphere, causing its waves to oscillate in a specific direction
Unlike direct moonlight, which is
unpolarised
, the light that scatters in the sky becomes
linearly polarised
, meaning its
electric field aligns in a fixed plane
The
moon emits unpolarised light
, but when it interacts with
air molecules and dust particles
in the atmosphere, it
scatters and becomes polarised
intensity of polarised moonlight is much lower than polarised sunlight
, making it harder for most animals to detect.
The pattern of polarisation in moonlight remains stable
, allowing nocturnal animals to use it as a reliable
navigation tool
Why is it Important for Navigation?
Many nocturnal animals, including
, rely on
celestial cues
to orient themselves.
Unlike the moon’s direct position, which changes with phases and cloud cover, the polarisation pattern remains detectable throughout the night
This enables ants to
navigate effectively even under crescent or waning moons
, where light intensity is significantly lower.
E-Vector Pattern and Ant Navigation
Polarised moonlight forms a distinct pattern in the sky
, known as the
E-vector pattern
This pattern
shifts based on the moon’s position
, but its
orientation remains stable
, allowing insects like ants to use it as a
natural compass
E-vector pattern aligns at 90° to the moon’s direct light
, creating a
predictable navigation reference
How do Bull Ants use it?
Ants detect the E-vector pattern in the night sky
using their
specialised compound eyes
, which are sensitive to polarised light.
Even in dim conditions, they adjust their movements
according to the
orientation of polarised moonlight
Researchers found that
when the E-vector was artificially rotated, the ants changed their paths accordingly
, confirming that they rely on this pattern.
When the
moonlight disappeared (during a new moon phase)
struggled to navigate
, further proving their dependence on
polarised lunar light
