Spike in India’s trade deficit
Why in news?
After a strong start to goods exports in the first quarter of 2024-25, momentum slowed, with export values dropping 1.5% in July and further contracting by 9.3% in August, reaching an eight-month low.
Meanwhile, imports hit a record $64.4 billion in August, leading to a merchandise trade deficit of $29.7 billion, the second highest after October 2023's record $29.9 billion gap.

Long-Term Challenges for India’s Export Growth
Export Contraction Amid Rising Imports
In July and August 2024, India's exports saw a decline, with a 1.5% drop in July and a sharper 9.3% fall in August.
Despite this, imports grew by 7.5% in July and 3.3% in August, pushing the trade deficit to a nine-month high of $23.5 billion in July and widening it by $6.2 billion in August.
Sectoral Performance and Key Export Declines
While a majority of India's top export segments showed growth, major sectors like petroleum and gems and jewellery significantly dropped.
Oil exports plunged 22.2% in July and 37.6% in August, while jewellery exports fell by over 20% in both months.
Growth also slowed in key sectors like pharmaceuticals, electronics, and materials like stone and iron ore, especially due to the slowdown in China's economy.
Oil Import Bill and Trade Deficit Dynamics
In August, the drop in oil prices ($6 per barrel) led to a 30% decline in India's oil import bill, reducing it to $11 billion—the lowest in three years.
Despite this, the widening trade deficit was largely driven by shrinking gems and jewellery exports, with some contribution from miscellaneous products and electronics.
Gold Import Surge
India's gold imports surged to a record $10.1 billion in August, more than double the July figure and in sharp contrast to the 10.7% drop in July.
This was due to a reduction in gold import duties (from 15% to 6%) in the Budget, rising gold prices, and festive season stockpiling by domestic jewellery players.
Economists expect the impact of these duty cuts to continue affecting the import bill in the coming months.
No Significant Economic Risk Amid Trade Deficit
Despite the growing trade deficit, experts emphasized that India’s high growth rate means its demand for global products will naturally outpace global demand for its exports.
They asserted that the trade deficit is not a concern for a developing, fast-growing economy, as long as there are no foreign exchange issues.
Strong Foreign Capital Inflows and Forex Reserves
India's foreign capital inflows have remained positive in recent months, and as of August 2, 2024, the country's foreign exchange reserves reached a record $675 billion.
The Finance Ministry estimates this is enough to cover 11.6 months of imports, though this may slightly decrease if imports remain above $60 billion.
Services Exports Provide Stability
India’s services exports, which have grown by over 10% from April to August 2024, offer some stability and provide an additional buffer against the widening trade deficit, contributing positively to the economy.
Global Trade Outlook for 2024: Tepid Demand in Developed Markets
While global trade is expected to grow faster in 2024 than in 2023, demand remains weak in most developed markets.
Geopolitical risks, ongoing conflicts, and the upcoming U.S. election, coupled with tariff hikes on Chinese goods, create a challenging environment for India and other players.
Impact of U.S.-China Trade Tensions
As China's domestic economy falters and U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods rise, China may shift its focus to non-U.S. markets, dumping products at low prices.
This could negatively impact India, particularly as China’s demand for imports declines.
Oil Prices and Export Concerns
Low global demand is expected to keep oil prices down, affecting India’s hopes for oil exports.
While lower oil prices benefit importers, it weakens India’s oil export prospects, with overall concerns about global demand continuing to grow.
India’s goal to scale up services and goods exports to $1 trillion each by 2030 faces significant hurdles.
Economic experts highlighted
global economic slowdown, the rise of tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and new trade policies such as the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and Deforestation Rules
as major challenges.
They noted that while short-term opportunities for export growth may arise, the long-term outlook will be difficult.

**********India - US Bilateral Ties
Why in News?
As the Prime Minister of India is on his 3-day visit to America, to meet the US President and participate in the 6
QUAD summit, there is the need to analyse the transformation in the India - US ties over the years.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Transformation in India-US Bilateral Relations
The Agenda for the Indian PM's Recent Visit to the US
Transformation in India-US Bilateral Relations:
Background:
The US-India ties have
gone through years of ups and downs over the last 75 years.
For example
, the US imposed sanctions on India after it conducted two nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998, and then the normalisation of relations, which culminated in the Indo-US nuclear deal in 2008.
The US is India's largest trading partner with a bilateral trade in goods and services crossing
US$ 191 billion in 2022
Transformation in relations:
The 1st transformation
was roughly between 2001 - when George W Bush came to power - and the end of the Donald J Trump presidency.
In this phase, the
US has been accommodating
to India's key national interests while still
acknowledging unresolved concerns
The 2nd transformation
was during the tenure of the 46th President of the US - Joe Biden.
The Modi-Biden era:
This era emphasised upon mutual interests and strategic alignment, particularly in
response to China's growing influence
In 2023, National Security Advisors (NSA) on both sides inaugurated the India-US initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (
iCET
).
The establishment of the
Strategic Trade Dialogue
and ongoing
defence exercises
highlight their commitment to sustaining the momentum in their relationship.
Five 2+2 meetings
(with respective defence and foreign ministers) have taken place, and the supply of
C-130Js, C-17s, P8Is, Apaches, Chinooks, and MH60R helicopters
are changing capabilities for the Indian military.
Challenges faced during the Modi-Biden era:
India’s increasing import of oil and deep military dependencies on
The respective stakes at play regarding the war in
Ukraine
, differing views on the meaning of rights, and the effects of an
alleged Indian intelligence-led operation
on American soil.
However, these challenges have left the
strategic design for deeper partnerships
between the two countries largely
untouched
The deeper partnerships between the two countries are
expected to be sustained
as the 47th American president is elected later this year.
The Agenda for the Indian PM's Recent Visit to the US:
Boosting bilateral ties:
The two leaders discussed ways to deepen cooperation across various sectors, highlighting that both nations now enjoy a “
comprehensive global strategic partnership
.”
Expanding India's global role:
President Biden praised India's leadership on the world stage, highlighting India’s role -
During the G20 presidentship,
In strengthening the Quad,
Reinforcing the need for a “free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” etc.
Space to semiconductors:
Both Leaders committed to enhance regular engagements to improve the momentum of collaboration in fields such as
space, AI, quantum, biotechnology, etc.
They hailed plans for
a semiconductor fabrication plant
, which will support national security and next-generation telecommunications.
Impetus to defence ties:
President Biden welcomed the progress in India’s procurement of
31 General Atomics MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft
, which will enhance India's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities.
Biden also highlighted India’s decision to simplify its tax structure on
maintenance, repair, and overhaul services
, calling it a significant step for building a
robust aviation ecosystem
Clean energy initiatives:
The White House announced that initial efforts aim to unlock $1 billion of multilateral financing to support projects across the clean energy value chain.
Promoting global health and development:
The two leaders celebrated the new
US-India Drug Policy Framework
, designed to combat the illicit production and trafficking of synthetic drugs.
They also applauded the inaugural
U.S.-India Cancer Dialogue
, as tackling cancer requires collaboration and innovation.
Both sides highlighted enhanced cooperation in agriculture
, committing to improve productivity and share best practices.

**********The Deposit Issue: Why Banks are Struggling to Lend
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction
India’s Growth (Govt. Spending, Widening Credit Gap, Changing Investment Habits, etc.)
Introduction:
India is among the fastest-growing large economies, driven largely by the Central government’s increased expenditure on infrastructure.
However, challenges such as job creation and subdued private investment persist, as highlighted in recent reports by the World Bank and the Economic Survey 2023-2024.
Growth Driven by Government Spending:
The government’s capital expenditure has significantly boosted the productive potential of the economy.
However, private investment, crucial for job creation, has been mediocre.
In the fourth quarter of FY24, private Gross Fixed Capital Formation fell to a four-quarter low of 6.46%, down from 9.7% in the previous quarter.
(GFCF) is a measure of how much money is being invested in physical assets like buildings, machinery, equipment, and infrastructure within an economy.
It represents the net increase in a country’s stock of fixed assets, which are essential for production and economic growth.
Between FY19 and FY23, the share of private non-financial corporations in GFCF increased marginally from 34.1% to 34.9%.
The government has urged the private sector to take the lead in driving growth.
Widening Credit Gap:
A key issue impacting private investment is the reduced risk appetite of banks to lend to the private sector.
As per one report, credit growth will decline to 14% in the current financial year, down from 16% last year.
A growing gap between credit and deposit growth is creating a liquidity crunch, with deposit growth averaging 11.1% over the past two years, compared to 16.8% credit growth.
This gap has been exacerbated by the
declining share of Current and Savings Accounts (CASA) in total deposits
Lagging Behind Asian Peers:
India's credit-to-GDP ratio is lower than other Asian countries with similar income levels, such as Thailand, Malaysia, and China
This lag is partly due to stricter regulatory requirements, such as the proposed Liquidity Coverage Ratio guidelines, which could further impede credit growth.
(LCR) is a financial rule that requires banks to hold a certain amount of high-quality liquid assets (like cash or government bonds) that can be easily sold.
The purpose of the LCR is
to ensure that banks have enough liquid assets to cover their short-term obligations in times of financial stress
, specifically for 30 days.
Changing Investment Habits and Impact on Deposits:
Households are increasingly investing in capital markets rather than traditional bank deposits, driven by the post-pandemic rise in market returns.
This shift is altering the composition of deposits, affecting the money multiplier and deposit creation processes.
Additionally, reduced government spending in the lead-up to elections has exacerbated the deposit crunch, with government cash balances at the RBI rising significantly.
Private Sector Investment Cycle:
There are early signs of revival in private sector investment, spurred by government spending on infrastructure and a rebound in the housing sector.
However, there is a long way to go for a broad-based recovery.
Despite measures like corporate tax cuts in 2019 and the introduction of the Production Linked Investment (PLI) scheme,
corporate tax contributions to government revenue have not increased proportionately
Conclusion:
While India’s economy continues to grow rapidly, challenges such as low private investment, a widening credit-deposit gap, and changing investment habits pose significant risks.
Addressing these issues will be crucial to sustaining growth and achieving a balanced economic recovery.
