two vacant member positions—one judicial and one non-judicial.
This shortage hampers its ability to effectively discharge its functions.

external agencies
like the CBI or the police for conducting investigations, which undermines its independence.
No Comprehensive Oversight Mechanism

Director of Inquiry and Director of Prosecution
Clearly Relations with CBI and Other Agencies
: A clear delineation of Lokpal’s
supervisory powers
over the
I and coordination mechanisms with the
Enforcement Directorate (ED)
should be established.
Adopt Best Practices from Global Standards
: India should adopt best practices from countries with robust
whistleblower protection frameworks,
in alignment with the
United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)
, to encourage more individuals to report corruption without fear.
Implement Recommendations from Committees
: The government should actively consider and implement recommendations made by committees like the
to enhance Lokpal's accountability, streamline processes, and improve its operational efficiency.
