Poleward Shift of Atmospheric Rivers
Source: DTE
Why in News?
A recent study reported that atmospheric rivers have shifted 6 to 10 degrees poleward over the past 40 years, influencing global weather patterns.
This shift is increasing
droughts
in some regions while intensifying
floods
in others, with major implications for water resources and climate stability.

Why are Atmospheric Rivers Shifting Polewards?
Sea Surface Temperature Changes:
Atmospheric rivers are shifting poleward due to
cooling of sea surface temperatures
in the
eastern tropical Pacific
since 2000, associated with
La Niña
conditions.
As a result,
subtropics may experience more prolonged droughts
nd water scarcity,
higher latitudes could see more extreme rainfall and flooding
Walker Circulation
: During
Walker circulation
strengthens over the
western Pacific
, expanding the tropical rainfall belt. This change, combined with alterations in atmospheric eddy patterns, creates high-pressure anomalies that steer ARs toward the poles.
The
is a cyclic pattern of air movement around the
equator
that plays a crucial role in
climate and weather.
Long-term Climate Trends:
IPCC
reports that global temperatures have increased by approximately 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era. Warmer conditions have altered jet stream patterns, shifting them poleward. This movement pushes ARs toward higher latitudes, impacting weather patterns and raising the frequency of extreme events in those areas.
What are Implications of the Poleward Shift of Atmospheric Rivers?
Water Resource Management
: Subtropics regions like California and southern Brazil, which rely on ARs for vital rainfall, may face
longer droughts and water shortages
as ARs become
less frequent
. This could lead to increased stress on agriculture and local communities.
Increased Flooding and Landslides
: Higher Latitudes areas like the US Pacific Northwest, Europe, and even polar regions could see more
extreme rainfall, flooding, and landslides
due to the poleward movement of ARs threatening infrastructure and safety.
Arctic Climate Impact:
The movement of ARs into the Arctic could
accelerate sea ice melting
Research found that atmospheric rivers contribute to
36% of the rise in summer moisture
over the Arctic since 1979.
Predictive Challenges:
The variability of natural processes, such as the oscillation between
El Niño
La Niña,
complicates predictions about future atmospheric river behaviour.
Current
climate models
may underestimate these natural variabilities, leading to potential miscalculations in forecasting weather patterns and water availability.
What are Atmospheric Rivers?
About:
Atmospheric rivers (ARs)
long, narrow bands of moisture in the atmosphere
transport vast amounts of water vapour from tropical regions to mid-latitude areas
other areas
, particularly outside of the tropics.
E.g., The
“Pineapple Express”
is an atmospheric river transporting warm, humid air from the tropical Pacific near Hawaii to North America’s west coast, particularly California.
Conditions Required for Formation of AR:
Strong Low-Level Winds:
These winds serve as pathways for transporting water vapour, with
jet streams
Northern and Southern hemispheres
acting as
high-speed channels,
sometimes reaching up to 442 km/h (275 mph).
High Moisture Levels
: Adequate moisture is critical to initiate precipitation processes.
Orographic Lift:
When moist
air masses
ascend over elevated terrain, such as mountains, they cool as they rise. This cooling process increases humidity, leading to cloud formation and, under suitable conditions, precipitation.
Categories:
Category 1 (Weak):
A mild, short-duration event, with beneficial effects like
light rainfall
over 24 hours.
Category 2 (Moderate):
A Category 2 atmospheric river is a
moderate storm
with mostly beneficial effects, but also somewhat hazardous.
Category 3 (Strong):
stronger and more prolonged event
, bringing 5-10 inches of rain over 36 hours. It can help replenish reservoirs but may also raise some rivers near flood stage.
Category 4 (Extreme):
Primarily hazardous, though with limited benefits. It can bring
intense rainfall
over several days, likely pushing many rivers to flood levels.
Category 5 (Exceptional):
Largely hazardous
e.g., an atmospheric river over Central California during the 1996-97 caused damages exceeding USD 100 billion.
Key Characteristics:
Length:
Often referred to as
"rivers in the sky,"
atmospheric rivers can extend for thousands of kilometres and vary in size and strength, similar to terrestrial rivers.
Seasonal Occurrence
: In the Northern Hemisphere, they typically occur between December and February, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they are most common from June to August.
In August 2022,
New Zealand
experienced an atmospheric river that caused record
rainfall, flooding, and displacement
was struck by
12 atmospheric rivers
between December 2022 and March 2023, resulting in intense
rainfall, flooding, and wind damage.
Water Vapour Capacity:
An average atmospheric river transports water vapour equivalent to the flow at the mouth of the
Mississippi River
, with exceptionally strong ones capable of carrying up to 15 times that volume.
Variability:
No two atmospheric rivers are alike; their characteristics differ based on factors like atmospheric instability and
Atmospheric rivers can produce both beneficial rainfall and destructive flooding, highlighting their dual role in influencing weather patterns.
Atmospheric River on Reaching Land:
When an
atmospheric river reaches land
moisture-laden air rises and cools
over mountain ranges, resulting in
heavy precipitation as rain or snow.
Unlike cold winter storms, atmospheric rivers are warm, leading to rapid snowpack melting, runoff, and flooding, impacting regions’ water supply.
The Role of Climate Change:
Climate change
is causing average temperatures on Earth to rise, leading to more water vapour in the
and increasing the likelihood of damaging atmospheric rivers.
Studies indicate that atmospheric rivers in the Southern Hemisphere have been
shifting poleward by up to 0.72° per decade
due to anthropogenic factors.
These shifts influence
ocean temperatures, atmospheric CO2 levels,
and the
ozone layer
As the planet warms, the
intensity and frequency
of atmospheric rivers are
expected to increase
more extreme rainfall events
by up to 40% in some areas.

What are the Role of Atmospheric Rivers?
Positive Role:
Redistribution of Freshwater:
AR are responsible for more than 50% of the mean annual runoff in many regions. For example, California relies on ARs for up to 50% of its annual rainfall, making them vital for water supply and agriculture.
Global Water Cycle:
AR plays a vital role in the
global water cycle
, influencing both water supply and flood risks, especially in the western United States. They are essential for replenishing snowpacks and can significantly impact weather patterns.
Snowpack Formation:
During colder months, atmospheric rivers deposit snow, which later melts to maintain water levels in warmer months. Snowpacks also reflect sunlight, helping cool Earth's surface.
Negative Role:
Flooding:
Excessive precipitation can lead to soil saturation, which in turn causes
, particularly in areas without sufficient vegetation.
Landslides and Mudslides:
Steep terrain, deforested areas, and large amounts of rain increase the risk of
and mudslides
Droughts:
A lack of atmospheric rivers can contribute to prolonged droughts, leading to water scarcity,
food insecurity,
and heightened human conflicts.

Conclusion
poleward shift of atmospheric rivers
, driven by climate change, is causing significant disruptions in global weather patterns.
Higher latitudes
increased precipitation and flooding
lower latitudes

. To mitigate these impacts, it is crucial to improve
weather forecasting
