Govt cautions AIIMS, PGI on Science Congress body
Why in news?
The Department of Science and Technology (DST) has instructed top medical institutions, including all AIIMS, not to allow representatives from the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) on their boards or committees for now.
The DST has also advised the Health Ministry to obtain a no-objection certificate before nominating any ISCA office-bearers to the governing bodies or committees of any autonomous organizations under its domain. It should be note that earlier, members of the ISCA were deputed as ex officio members of governing bodies in different institutions such as AIIMS Delhi, AIIMS Patna etc.
In a recent letter to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the DST stated that it does not recognize the current Executive Council of ISCA, having suspended all its office-bearers. Consequently, ISCA representatives should be excluded from the boards of medical institutions such as AIIMS and PGI Chandigarh.

Indian Science Congress (ISC)
About
ISC is a one-of-its-kind event in the country which brings together the scientific communities on a platform for their interaction with students and the general public on matters related to science.
The event is organized by the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA).
ISCA is an independent body functioning with the support of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) in the central government.
Dubbed as the largest gathering of scientists and students in the country, the Science Congress is an annual five-day event from January 3 to 7, a permanent fixture on the Prime Minister’s calendar.
The first session of the Indian Science Congress was held in 1914 at the premises of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta.
Funding
The DST pays the salaries of ISCA’s permanent secretarial staff and also provides a grant every year to enable the holding of Science Congress.
In September 2023,
DST withdrew its funding for the Science Congress due to 'financial irregularities'
and amended the by-laws to impose stricter controls on the use of government funds.
Declining glory of ISC
In more recent times, the event has attracted attention for all the wrong reasons:
lack of serious discussion, the promotion of pseudoscience, outlandish claims by random speakers, and the absence of useful outcomes.
As a result, several top scientists have advocated the discontinuation of the event, or at least withdrawal of government support.
For organising the Science Congress, the government provides an annual grant.
Besides this, the government has no role to play in organising the ISC.
ISCA in tussle with the DST in recent years
ISCA has faced ongoing disputes with the Department of Science and Technology (DST) in recent years, stemming from allegations of financial irregularities and misappropriation of government funds
The association has taken legal action against the government, with the issue still pending resolution.
For the first time in its history, the Science Congress, a key event on the Prime Minister's annual calendar, could not be held this year.
The Science Congress had to be abandoned in 2021 and 2022 as well but those were because of the disruption caused by Covid pandemic.
DST decided not to accept the new Executive Council constituted by ISCA
In March 2024, DST informed ISCA that it would not recognize the new office-bearers due to non-compliance with established by-laws and previous directives, deeming their election "unlawful and unacceptable."
In May, DST further prohibited ISCA from holding a meeting of the newly constituted Executive Council for similar reasons.

**********What is the Gender Gap in Education?
Why in the News?
The World Economic Forum (WEF) report of 2024 on global gender gaps recently ranked India at
129 out of 146 economies
, with a decline in the education sector being one of the reasons for India’s rank slipping a couple of places this year.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Global Gender Gap Report (Objective, Key Components, etc.)
Global Gender Gap Report 2024 (Ranking, India’s Performance in Education Component)
Global Gender Gap Report:
The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report is an annual publication that
evaluates the progress towards gender equality worldwide
Established in 2006, this report offers a comprehensive analysis of gender-based disparities across four key areas:
Economic Participation and Opportunity,
Educational Attainment,
Health and Survival, and
Political Empowerment.
Key Components of the Report:
This dimension assesses gender disparities in the workplace, including labor force participation, wage equality for similar work, and the presence of women in high-ranking roles across industries.
This category measures the gap between men and women in terms of access to education.
It evaluates literacy rates and the enrolment levels in primary, secondary, and tertiary education.
This area examines life expectancy and sex ratio at birth to understand the disparities in health outcomes between genders.
This dimension looks at the representation of women in political decision-making positions, including the proportion of women in parliamentary seats and ministerial roles.
Methodology:
The report uses a scoring system ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates full parity between men and women and 0 indicates absolute disparity.
Countries are ranked based on their scores in each of the four categories, and an overall rank is assigned to each country.
Global Gender Gap 2024 Report:
The World Economic Forum 2024 report on global gender gaps
highlights significant disparities in education, ranking India 129th out of 146 countries, partly due to a decline in educational attainment indicators
This represents a drop from the previous year, where India had a perfect score in educational parity.
Key Findings and Statistics w.r.t Education Attainment:
Enrolment and Literacy Rates:
Despite high enrolment rates for women in primary, secondary, and tertiary education, the literacy rate gap between men and women stands at 17.2 percentage points.
The latest figures show that girls constitute 48% of the school population, with a slight decline in secondary education but a higher retention rate at the higher secondary level.
Higher Education:
The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for women in higher education is 28.5%, slightly above the male GER of 28.3%.
Female enrolment has increased by 32% since 2014-15.
Influencing Factors:
Infrastructure Development:
Building more schools, especially since the mid-90s, has significantly boosted girls' enrolment.
However, regional disparities persist, with some states lagging in secondary education infrastructure.
Female Teachers:
The presence of women teachers positively impacts girls' enrolment.
Schools with only male teachers face lower enrolment of girls due to parental concerns.
Transportation and Sanitation:
Free transport and the provision of cycles have helped increase enrolment.
However, inadequate sanitation facilities, particularly for menstruating girls, remain a major barrier.
Future Challenges:
Higher Secondary and College Education:
While some states report higher enrolment of girls in higher secondary education, concerns are rising about boys dropping out.
STEM Education:
Women make up only 42.5% of students in STEM fields, highlighting the need for targeted encouragement.
Adult Literacy:
The 2011 Census data reveals a significant gender gap in adult literacy, with only 64.63% of women being literate compared to 80.88% of men.
Recommendations:
Improving School Infrastructure:
Continued investment in building and maintaining school facilities, especially in rural areas.
Increasing Female Teacher Presence:
Recruiting and retaining more female teachers to create a comfortable learning environment for girls.
Enhanced Sanitation Facilities:
Ensuring proper maintenance of washrooms to prevent dropouts among older girls.
Focus on Foundational Literacy:
Strengthening foundational literacy programs and extending education to rural women to bridge the adult literacy gap.
By addressing these challenges, India can make significant strides toward closing the gender gap in education and achieving greater gender parity in the coming years.

**********Implementation of the Plastic Waste Trading Scheme
Why in News?
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has initiated a nationwide audit of about 800 recyclers of plastic waste across the country.
This was decided following the revelation that four firms in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka had issued about 600,000 bogus certificates under
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme.
What’s in Today’s Article?
An Overview Plastic Waste in India
Efforts for the Scientific Management of Plastic Waste in India
How did Plastic Waste Recyclers Violate the EPR Scheme?
An Overview Plastic Waste in India:
Plastic has several applications and its physical and chemical properties contribute to its commercial success.
However, the indiscriminate disposal of plastic (especially plastic carry bags) has become a huge
environmental hazard.
In response to a question, the Minister of Environment (MOEFCC) recently stated in the Parliament of India that
more than 34 lakh tonnes
of plastic garbage were generated in 2019-20, up from 30.59 lakh tonnes in 2018-19.
This indicates that in the last five years, India's plastic garbage creation has
more than doubled,
with
an average yearly rise of 21.8%.
In order to solve the issue and for the scientific management of plastic waste, the government has notified the
Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016
(amended in 2018 and 2021).
Efforts for the Scientific Management of Plastic Waste in India:
The Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016:
About:
The rules mandate plastic waste generators to take steps to reduce plastic waste, ensure segregated storage at the source and give it over to local bodies or agencies.
Objectives:
raise the minimum thickness of plastic carry bags
from 40 to 50 microns and to mandate a minimum thickness of 50 microns for plastic sheets in order to assist the collection and recycling of plastic waste.
Expand the jurisdiction of applicability
from the municipal area to rural areas, as plastic has also reached rural areas.
To bring in the responsibilities of producers and generators, etc.
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):
Under this, producers, importers and brand owners have been made responsible for collecting waste generated by their products.
Producers
are those engaged in the manufacture or import of carry bags, multi-layered packaging and sheets and those using these for packaging or wrapping their products.
They must engage local governments to develop a plan or system for plastic waste management within the timeframe specified.
The Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules 2018:
The amended Rules are now applicable to
Multilayered Plastic
(MLP) and mandates phasing out of MLP, which are non-recyclable or non-energy recoverable or with no alternate use.
The Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021:
The rules prohibit identified single use plastic items which have low utility and high littering potential by 2022.
Banning SUP:
On August 12, 2021, a ban on identified single-use plastic (SUP) items was notified by the MOEFCC under the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021. It came into force on July 1, 2022.
About the EPR certificates:
The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 mandate all companies that use plastic packaging to register with the CPCB.
The EPR scheme mandates businesses that use plastic packaging material to
recycle a certain percentage of the plastic used
in the previous two years.
In 2022-23, companies were expected to recycle 70% of the packaging used in the previous two financial years and
not complying with these targets can invite fines.
The EPR certificates
are generated by registered plastic waste recyclers who collect plastic waste and recycle them. Every tonne of plastic recycled by them generates a certificate.
Certificates are considered legitimate
only if recyclers are actually able to sell the recycled plastic.
The certificates are uploaded on a dedicated portal maintained by the CPCB and recyclers and buyers can transact online to trade in these certificates.
What has been found?
The four recycling companies have generated many more EPR certificates than the installed capacity of their plants.
They were unable to establish proof of sales to the CPCB.
What may be the possible reason for this violation?
Lack of clarity
among recyclers on the mechanics of the EPR scheme.
This is akin to the early years of implementing GST (Goods and Services Tax) or filing Income Tax returns online.

**********Anti-reservation protests in Bangladesh
Why in news?
Protests against job quotas in Bangladesh have turned violent, resulting in over 100 deaths and leading to a siege of Dhaka. In response, the Sheikh Hasina government has imposed a curfew and an internet shutdown.
New Delhi has refrained from commenting, considering it an internal matter for Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the Indian mission in Bangladesh has helped 978 Indians return home: 778 via land borders and around 200 by flights.
The mission is also in contact with more than 4,000 Indian students still in Bangladesh, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.

Background - reservation policy of Bangladesh
Why are students protesting in Bangladesh?
Razakars
Reservation system notified in 1972
The system was notified on September 5, 1972, reserving 30% of government and semi-government posts for freedom fighters, and 10% for women.
Situation after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh, in August 1975, however, the quotas were effectively frozen until 1996 — when Hasina became Prime Minister for the first time.
Benefits of the freedom fighters’ quota were subsequently extended to their sons and daughters.
Situation after 2001
After the Awami League lost power in 2001, the process of implementation of the quota slowed down again.
But Hasina returned as Prime Minister in 2009 and, two years later, the quota benefits were also made available to the grandchildren of freedom fighters.
Withdrawal of the quota in 2018
In 2018, the then Hasina government decided to scrap the freedom-fighter and other quotas.
This was subsequently challenged in the court.
In its June 5 order, the High Court ruled the government’s decision was arbitrary — and that the freedom fighters and their progeny remained one of the most backward sections of the country’s citizens.
Opposition to the return of a 30% quota in government employment
The protests are led by youths of Bangladesh.
They are opposed to the
return of a 30% quota in government employment at all levels for those who fought for the freedom of Bangladesh from Pakistan
, as well as their children and grandchildren.
Statement made by PM of Bangladesh
The situation was inflamed by a statement from PM Sheikh Hasina, in which she seemed to equate the protesters with the descendants of razakars.
Razakars were mercenary collaborators of the Pakistan military who led a brutal campaign of murder and rape in which up to 3 million Bangladeshis are estimated to have been killed in the space of a few months in 1971.
Violence Sparked by a court order
On June 5, the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reinstated the 30% job quota for freedom fighters' descendants, overturning a 2018 government decision to eliminate these quotas.
Although the government has expressed agreement with the students' demands, it has appealed to the Supreme Court, which has suspended the High Court's ruling and will hear the case on August 7.
Since April, students and teachers have been protesting, demanding that quotas be capped at 10%.
These protests have involved clashes with police and the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the ruling Awami League party.
Economy and employment
As per the experts, the violence is now being driven by wider economic discontent, including high inflation, growing unemployment, and shrinking foreign exchange reserves.
More than two-thirds of Bangladesh’s 170 million population is the working age group of 15-64.
As per official data, ~1.9 million young people join job market every year.
Besides the 30% quota for freedom fighters, there are 10% quotas each for women and backward districts, 5% for members of tribal communities, and 1% for persons with disabilities, taking the total reservation to 56%.
Government jobs in Bangladesh are highly sought after for their stability and guaranteed income.
The country's export-oriented enterprises are still recovering from disruptions caused by COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine.
Between 2019 and 2023, only 3.5 lakh government appointments were made, leaving over 5 lakh positions vacant.
In what was then East Pakistan, the Pakistan Armed Forces, along with radical Islamists, formed
three main militias
Razakars, al-Badr, and al-Shams
—to suppress civil liberties, target freedom fighters, and terrorize civilians.
These militias, with the support of the Pakistan Armed Forces, subjected Bengalis to genocidal acts, including rape, torture, murder, and forced deportation.
As per historians, the term "Rezakar" originated in Hyderabad (modern-day India) and referred to "volunteers."
In India, the Rezakars were a paramilitary force in Hyderabad that opposed integration with India after 1947.
They were founded by Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Bahadur Yar Jung and led by Qasim Rizvi.
After their defeat by the Indian Armed Forces in Operation Polo in 1948, Rizvi emigrated to Pakistan.
