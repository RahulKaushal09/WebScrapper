COMPENSATORY AFFORESTATION
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – ENVIRONMENT
Context:
A recent audit report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on the functioning of the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) in the 2019-2022 period has flagged that the funds allocated for compensatory afforestation were diverted for other activities by Uttarakhand’s forest divisions.
Background: –
As per CAMPA guidelines, after receiving funds, afforestation should be conducted within a year, or two growing seasons. However, the report flagged that in 37 cases, compensatory afforestation was executed after more than eight years of getting final clearance.
Key takeaways
The simple principle that works in compensatory afforestation is that since forests are an important resource and render ecological services, they must not be destroyed. However, because of developmental requirements, forests are routinely cut, or, as it is said in official language, “diverted for non-forest purposes”.
But since afforested land does not become a forest overnight, there is still a loss of the goods and services that the diverted forest would have provided in the interim period. These goods and services include timber, bamboo, fuelwood, carbon sequestration, soil conservation, water recharge, and seed dispersal.
Afforested land is expected to take no less than 50 years to start delivering comparable goods and services. To compensate for the loss in the interim, the law requires that the Net Present Value (NPV) of the diverted forest is calculated for a period of 50 years, and recovered from the “user agency” that is “diverting” the forests.
“User agencies”, which are often private parties, are not expected to undertake afforestation work themselves. This work has to be done by the state government. But the entire expenditure to be incurred on creating this new ‘forest’, including purchase of land for the purpose, has to be borne by the user.
Thus, if any user agency wants to divert forest land for non-forest purposes, it has to deposit money for compensatory afforestation as well as pay the NPV, besides a few other charges.
CAMPA is set up to manage this money. The compensatory afforestation money and NPV are supposed to be collected from the user agency by the government of the state in which the project is located, and deposited with the central government. The money will eventually flow back to the state to be used for afforestation or related works.
The Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act 2016 created a national CAMPA at the central government level, and a state CAMPA in each state and UT. Similarly, a National Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF), and one in each state and UT too are also constituted.
The states deposit money collected from user agencies with the national CAF, to be eventually credited into state CAFs as per their entitlement. The states, however, receive only 90% of their share; the other 10%  are held back to cover administrative expenses.

ARTICLE 101(4)
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
Incarcerated Khadoor Sahib MP Amritpal Singh moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court to attend the ongoing Parliament session, lest he lose his seat because of his prolonged absence from the House.
Amritpal, who faces charges under National Security Act, has been detained in Dibrugarh since April 2023. He contested and won the 2024 Lok Sabha election from prison, but thus far has an attendance of only 2%.
“If for a period of sixty days a member of either House of Parliament is without permission of the House absent from all meetings thereof, the House may declare his seat vacant,” Article 101(4) says.
The 60 days, however, do not account for “any period during which the House is prorogued or is adjourned for more than four consecutive days”.
Effectively, the period of absence is only calculated based on the actual sittings of Parliament. Amritpal, for instance, only attended one sitting of the Lok Sabha — the one in which he was sworn in last July. Since then, he has remained in detention in Assam.
MPs can seek leave
The operative term in Article 101(4) is “without permission of the House”. For long absences, MPs write to the ‘Committee on Absence of Members from the Sittings of the House’, the parliamentary panel that deals with this issue.
The committee makes recommendations on each leave application, which are then ratified by the House concerned. In practice, however, applications are seldom rejected.
Past leave application reports list illness — their own or some relative’s — as the most common reason for MPs being granted leave. That said, members have requested and been granted leave on the count of being imprisoned as well.
In 2023, then Ghosi MP Atul Rai of the Bahujan Samaj Party sought permission to remain absent on 23 consecutive sittings of Parliament as he was in jail. His application was granted.
Even if an MP is absent for more than 60 days, the House has to “declare” the seat vacant, meaning the matter has to be put to vote.

STAGFLATION
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
Stubborn inflation and President Donald Trump’s hard-line trade policies have rekindled fears of stagflation, a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation that haunted the U.S. in the 1970s.
A critical component of the stagflation phenomenon—persistently high inflation—became more pronounced earlier this month when data revealed that consumer prices in January experienced their most rapid monthly increase since August 2023.
Meanwhile, the trajectory of U.S. economic growth remains uncertain, with the potential inflationary impact of Mr. Trump’s tariffs posing a risk that could further exacerbate the situation.
Stagflation is a rare economic condition where high inflation coexists with stagnant economic growth and high unemployment. This phenomenon contradicts conventional economic theories, which suggest that inflation and economic growth generally move in the same direction.
Understanding Stagflation:
The term “stagflation” is a combination of stagnation (slow or no economic growth) and inflation (rising prices).
Typically, inflation is associated with economic expansion, but in stagflation, rising prices occur alongside weak demand and high unemployment.
Causes of Stagflation:
Supply-Side Shocks: A sudden increase in the cost of essential goods (e.g., crude oil prices) can drive inflation while simultaneously slowing economic activity.
Monetary Policy Failures: Excessive money supply without corresponding economic growth can lead to inflation without boosting employment or output.
Structural Rigidities: Labor market inefficiencies, lack of productivity growth, and supply chain disruptions can contribute to stagnant growth and rising inflation.
External Factors: Geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and commodity price volatility can create stagflationary conditions.
Historical Example: The 1970s Oil Crisis is a classic example, where oil price shocks caused high inflation while economies faced recessionary pressures.
Impact of Stagflation:
Economic Growth Decline: Businesses struggle due to high costs, reducing production and investments.
Unemployment Increases: Job losses occur as firms cut back on hiring due to weak demand.
Declining Purchasing Power: Rising prices erode consumer savings and wages, impacting living standards.
Policy Dilemma: Central banks face difficulty in addressing stagflation since measures to curb inflation (e.g., high interest rates) can further slow growth, while stimulus measures (e.g., low interest rates) can worsen inflation.

**********Brine Pools
Scientists recently discovered a deadly secret lurking beneath the Red Sea, brine pools so extreme that they instantly kill or stun any marine life that enters.
About Brine Pools:
Brine pools are the lakes of
hypersaline, anoxic (oxygen-lacking) water
that form on the seafloor
They are often referred to as
“underwater lakes” or “brine lakes”
because they appear as
distinct pools, separate from the surrounding seawater
due to their high salinity and density.
The water in the brine pool is filtered through
salt sediments
The deepest-known brine pool lies in the
Orca Basin in the Gulf of Mexico,
some 2,200 m below sea level.
This depression is filled with water that has a salt content of around 300 g/litre, around eight times saltier than the Gulf itself.
The salinity of these pools is so great that they are
toxic to most sea life,
but certain
highly adapted chemosynthetic organisms have found ways to survive
and even thrive on the shores of these undersea lakes.

**********LNG’s centrality in India – Qatar bilateral trade
Why in news?
India-Qatar trade is primarily driven by India's liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, with Qatar being its largest supplier. As both nations seek to double bilateral trade in the next five years, LNG is expected to remain a key factor in achieving this goal.
During the recent visit of Qatar’s Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, India and Qatar set a goal to double bilateral trade to $28 billion annually by 2030 and upgraded their ties to a strategic partnership.
What’s in today’s article?
LNG: The Energy Driving India-Qatar Trade
Growth in India’s LNG Imports and Qatar’s Expanding Export Capacity
The US Factor in India’s LNG Market
Conclusion: Energy as a Core Pillar
India’s LNG imports are set to rise over the next five years due to increasing natural gas consumption.
This aligns with Qatar’s plans to expand its LNG export capacity, making it a key supplier alongside the US.
Indian oil and gas companies are exploring both markets to meet growing demand.
Trade Imbalance in Qatar’s Favor
Despite India’s efforts to boost exports and attract Qatari investments, the trade balance remains heavily tilted towards Qatar.
LNG is the largest component of India’s imports from Qatar,
contributing 50% of total imports
, which stood at $11.49 billion in the first 11 months of 2024.
Other major imports include LPG, crude oil, plastics, and petrochemicals, while
India’s exports to Qatar were only $1.61 billion during the same period
Qatar’s Dominance in India’s LNG Imports
From January to November 2024, India imported 9.82 million tonnes of LNG from Qatar, making up 38.8% of India’s total LNG imports by volume.
In value terms, Qatar accounted for 41.2% of India’s LNG imports, worth $5.75 billion.
Long-Term LNG Contracts and Future Supply
India’s largest LNG importer,
Petronet LNG
, has a
long-term contract with Qatar for 7.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG, recently extended until 2048
In addition to these contracted volumes, Qatar also plays a significant role in India’s spot LNG market.
In December 2024, GAIL signed a five-year agreement with QatarEnergy for additional LNG supplies, further strengthening the energy partnership between the two nations.
India aims to increase natural gas’s share in its primary energy mix from just over 6% to 15% by 2030.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India’s natural gas consumption is expected to grow nearly 60% from 2023 levels, reaching 103 billion cubic metres (bcm) by 2030.
With domestic production meeting only half of the country’s demand, LNG imports are set to rise significantly in the coming years.
India’s Expanding Role in Global LNG Markets
Between 2013 and 2023, India’s LNG imports grew by 70%, reaching 36 bcm in 2024,
reinforcing its position as the world’s fourth-largest LNG importer
The IEA projects India’s LNG demand to grow at an annual rate of 11% until 2030, prompting Indian oil and gas companies to secure long-term supply contracts.
Recently, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) signed major LNG import agreements with global energy firms.
Qatar’s Expanding LNG Export Capacity
As India’s LNG imports surge, Qatar is set to almost double its liquefaction capacity from 77 mtpa to 142 mtpa by 2027.
This expansion could further solidify Qatar’s position as India’s leading LNG supplier, ensuring long-term energy security for both nations.
The United States, the world’s largest LNG exporter, is emerging as Qatar’s biggest competitor in India’s LNG market.
In January-November 2024,
India imported 5.12 million tonnes of LNG from the US, accounting for 20.2% of total LNG imports, valued at nearly $2.5 billion
US-India Energy Partnership
New Delhi and Washington have agreed to enhance US energy exports to India, aiming to position the US as a leading supplier of oil and gas.
This initiative could also help reduce the trade deficit between the two nations.
US LNG Export Policy and India’s Interest
With US President Donald Trump lifting the Biden-era ban on new LNG export permits, Washington is expected to strengthen its dominance in the global LNG market.
Indian oil and gas companies are actively exploring long-term LNG contracts with US suppliers.
Energy remains a central aspect of India-Qatar relations. Both nations are exploring ways to strengthen and expand their energy partnership, including potential mutual investments, as highlighted in the recent discussions between PM Modi and Al-Thani.

**********Quality of Public Expenditure Index
Why in the News?
The RBI has used data since 1991 to create the 'Quality of Public Expenditure' index to assess how well the government is spending its money.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, About QPE Index)
India’s Improved QPE (How India Improved, Key Indicators, Challenges, Future Outlook, etc.)
Introduction:
Government expenditure plays a
critical role
in shaping economic growth, infrastructure, and public welfare.
In India, the
Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
has developed a
Quality of Public Expenditure (QPE) Index
to analyse how efficiently both the Centre and states utilize public funds.
latest RBI report
suggests that
India's quality of public expenditure is at its highest level
since economic liberalization in
This improvement is attributed to
higher capital spending, fiscal discipline, and better allocation of resources
About Quality of Public Expenditure (QPE) Index:
The Quality of Public Expenditure Index is a framework created by the RBI to measure how effectively government funds are spent.
Instead of just looking at the total expenditure, the index evaluates the
composition of spending
and its
impact on long-term economic growth
Key Indicators of the QPE Index:
Capital Outlay to GDP Ratio
– Measures the proportion of government spending on infrastructure and development projects relative to GDP. A
higher ratio
indicates better quality expenditure.
Revenue Expenditure to Capital Outlay Ratio
– Assesses the balance between day-to-day operational expenses and long-term investment. A
lower ratio
is preferred, as excessive revenue expenditure weakens fiscal sustainability.
Development Expenditure to GDP Ratio
– Tracks public spending in
healthcare, education, research, infrastructure, and social welfare
. Higher investment in these sectors improves human capital and economic productivity.
Development Expenditure as a Percentage of Total Expenditure
– Evaluates the share of
productive investments
in overall government spending. The
higher the proportion
, the better.
Interest Payments to Total Government Expenditure Ratio
– Reflects the burden of government debt. A
lower percentage
indicates better fiscal management and reduced reliance on borrowed funds.
How India Improved the Quality of Its Public Expenditure:
Shift Toward Capital Expenditure
Over the past two decades, India has prioritized capital investment over revenue expenditure.
Unlike routine administrative costs, capital expenditure funds infrastructure, roads, energy, and digital connectivity, boosting long-term economic growth.
Implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act
To control government borrowing, India introduced the FRBM Act in 2003, limiting the
fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP
This move ensured that borrowing was primarily used for capital projects rather than operational expenses.
Managing Fiscal Deficit and Debt Levels
Instead of focusing solely on the annual fiscal deficit, India has shifted towards managing overall debt levels as a percentage of GDP. This approach helps maintain long-term fiscal sustainability while allowing flexibility in economic crises.
Rising Development Expenditure
The government has increased investment in education, healthcare, and social programs, improving human capital development and economic productivity.
Reduction in Interest Payment Burden
With better debt management and controlled borrowing, India has reduced its interest payment burden, ensuring more funds are allocated to productive sectors.
Challenges to Maintaining High-Quality Public Expenditure:
Despite these improvements, some challenges remain:
Crisis-Driven Fiscal Stimulus
– Events like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19 lockdowns forced the government to increase spending beyond fiscal limits, impacting expenditure quality.
Political Pressures for Loan Waivers and Freebies
– Increasing populist measures like loan waivers, direct cash transfers, and free electricity schemes put pressure on government finances.
Balancing Revenue and Capital Expenditure
– While capital investment has grown, revenue expenditure on salaries, subsidies, and interest payments remains high, reducing fiscal flexibility.
Key Findings from RBI’s QPE Index Analysis:
The RBI study divided
India’s fiscal performance since 1991 into six phases
, each shaped by economic policies and global events:
1991-2003
– Fiscal consolidation took priority, reducing public investment in infrastructure.
2003-2008
– Fiscal discipline and economic growth boosted capital spending and state revenues improved.
2008-2013
– The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) led to countercyclical spending, increasing deficits but supporting economic recovery.
2013-2017
– The 14th Finance Commission gave states more fiscal autonomy, improving state-level development expenditure.
2017-2020
– Introduction of GST led to initial revenue challenges for the Centre, while states benefited from higher tax shares.
2020-Present
– Post-COVID recovery, driven by record-high capital expenditure, has helped improve public expenditure quality.
Future Outlook: Strengthening India’s Public Expenditure Strategy:
Sustaining Capital Expenditure Growth
– Continued investment in infrastructure, renewable energy, and digital transformation.
Balancing Welfare and Development Spending
– Ensuring social schemes do not outweigh productive investments.
Enhancing Fiscal Federalism
– Strengthening Centre-state financial coordination for balanced economic development.
Maintaining Fiscal Discipline
– Keeping borrowing under control while ensuring growth-oriented public spending.
Strengthening Transparency and Monitoring
– Using data-driven governance models to track expenditure efficiency.
Conclusion:
India has made significant progress in improving the quality of public expenditure, with the RBI’s QPE Index showing its best performance since 1991.
A focus on capital investment, fiscal discipline, and effective debt management has enhanced economic growth and public welfare.
However, political populism and fiscal pressures remain key challenges.
To sustain these gains, policy continuity, efficient resource allocation, and financial discipline will be crucial in the years ahead.

**********Weaponization of the Special Marriage Act
Context:
The article highlights how a legal provision meant to facilitate interfaith and inter-caste marriages -
the Special Marriage Act, 1954 (SMA)
- is often
misused
to harass and intimidate couples,
particularly in cases involving religious differences
.
It discusses
a case from Bhopal
where an interfaith couple faced violence for attempting to register their marriage.
Case of Bhopal - When Law Becomes a Tool of Harassment:
A Hindu-Muslim couple in Bhopal
sought to marry under the SMA
, which
requires a 30-day public notice before solemnizing the marriage.
Their information was leaked, leading to
a violent mob attacking them at the court
The provision designed to ensure transparency instead
exposed them to social and communal backlash.
Key Issues with the Special Marriage Act (SMA), 1954:
Purpose vs. reality:
The SMA was enacted to
provide a secular legal framework for marriage
The law
allows interfaith and inter-caste marriages
outside religious personal laws, intending to
protect individual autonomy and choice
However,
the 30-day public notice requirement often leads to societal interference
, jeopardizing the safety of couples.
Violation of privacy:
The Supreme Court’s judgment in
Justice K.S. Puttaswamy
vs Union of India (2017) reaffirmed the
Right to Privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21
(Right to life and personal liberty).
The public notice provision
violates individual autonomy
, making personal decisions about marriage vulnerable to public scrutiny and opposition.
Social and religious backlash:
The leakage of private information from marriage registrars’ offices allows vigilante groups,
moral policing
, and religious extremists to harass couples.
Misuse of the no-objection clause:
The law allows
anyone
to object to the marriage on arbitrary grounds.
Objections often stem from
personal vendettas
, communal motives, or familial coercion rather than legitimate legal concerns.
Need for Reform:
The public notice requirement should be
re-examined or removed
to prevent privacy violations.
The SMA should be
aligned with constitutional values
of individual liberty and freedom of choice.
Ensure privacy protections
marriage registration
, in line with the Right to Privacy judgment.
The law should
ensure protection
rather than expose couples to threats.
Strict action
against harassment is needed to protect couples from societal backlash.
Conclusion:
The Special Marriage Act, intended as a progressive law, has become an instrument of persecution for interfaith and inter-caste couples.
Urgent legal reforms (for example,
Section 7 of the SMA
, which invites objections to marriages) are needed to prevent misuse and uphold the constitutional values of
secularism, equality, and personal liberty

**********The U.S. Visit, Viewed Through Industry’s Business Lens
Context
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the United States
marks a pivotal moment in the strengthening of bilateral ties between the two nations.
The visit, though brief, had profound implications
across multiple sectors, reinforcing the India-U.S. strategic partnership.
With major developments in trade, technology, defence, and energy, the visit has set the
foundation for deeper economic cooperation and technological integration
Now,
it is imperative to examine the significant outcomes of the visit,
highlighting its impact on trade liberalisation, technological advancement, defence collaborations, energy security, and educational ties.
Key Outcomes of PM Modi’s US Visit
Enhancing Trade and Investment
A key outcome of Modi’s visit was the initiation of
the first phase of a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA)
, aimed at reducing trade barriers and streamlining regulatory processes.
This
move is expected to foster greater economic engagement
, encouraging U.S. companies to invest in India and integrate the country into their supply chains.
With an ambitious
trade target of $500 billion by 2030,
both nations are poised for economic expansion through sectoral sub-targets and simplified cross-border procedures.
agreement also addresses tariff reduction
, particularly in sectors like industrial goods, labour-intensive products, and agriculture.
Additionally,
the push for greenfield investments, including those by Indian companies in the U.S.,
signifies a shift towards mutual economic growth.
As
the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has endorsed this target,
industries such as IT, pharmaceuticals, garments, and textiles stand to benefit from this enhanced economic collaboration.
While the U.S. market is already open to Indian exports, a structured BTA will facilitate greater investment and technology transfer
, making trade relations more balanced and mutually beneficial.
Technology and Innovation Cooperation
One of the most significant aspects of the visit was
the emphasis on strategic technological collaboration
through the U.S.-India Transforming the Relationship Utilising Strategic Technology
(TRUST) initiative
This agreement underscores the
deepening partnership in critical areas such as defence, artificial intelligence (AI),
semiconductors, quantum computing, biotechnology, energy, and space.
By
developing private sector cooperation, the TRUST initiative opens new pathways for research and innovation partnerships
between American technology giants and Indian enterprises.

, enabling expanded technology transfers, joint production, and industrial cooperation.
Agreements on co-production of advanced defence systems will bolster India’s indigenous manufacturing
, skill development, and economic growth.
Additionally, p
otential offset clauses in defence agreements can significantly benefit the Indian defence industry
by enhancing local production capabilities and reducing dependency on foreign imports.
Strengthened defence collaboration with the U.S. will
not only enhance India’s security infrastructure but also create opportunities for domestic manufacturers
to integrate into global defence supply chains.
Energy Security and Sustainability
Energy cooperation emerged as
another crucial area of discussion
, with both leaders emphasising the importance of long-term strategic linkages.
India’s growing energy demands necessitate diversification
of energy sources, and the U.S., with its vast natural gas reserves,
can serve as a reliable supplier.
India’s Union Budget 2025-26 highlights a commitment to collaborating with the private sector
on the development of small modular reactors (SMRs), an area where U.S. companies will play a critical role.

will provide Indian students with greater access to high-quality education without the need to relocate abroad.
Furthermore,
streamlining legal mobility will facilitate easier student and professional exchanges
Conclusion
Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the United States was more than a diplomatic engagement;
it laid the groundwork for a transformative economic and technological partnership between the two nations.
By creating trade liberalisation, deepening technology collaboration, strengthening defence ties, ensuring energy security, and enhancing education opportunities,
the visit has positioned India for sustained economic growth.
agreements reached reflect a shared vision for mutual prosperity
and strategic alignment in global affairs.
If implemented effectively,
these initiatives will not only strengthen the India-U.S. relationship but also contribute to India’s emergence as a global economic powerhouse.

**********Converting Court Case Backlogs into Treasure Trove
Context
Every
Chief Justice of India inherits the crisis
of backlog cases,
with pending cases stretching across all levels of the judiciary.
The
Supreme Court alone has around 82,000 cases
, while High Courts and lower courts collectively hold over five crore cases in waiting and this backlog not only delays justice but also undermines public faith in the legal system.
While
various factors contribute to the issue, ranging from a low judge-to-population ratio to an overburdened adversarial system
mediation emerges as a promising solution
to alleviate this judicial logjam.
The Burden of the Adversarial System and Structural Challenges
Excessive Litigation Culture and Multiple Appeals
One of the biggest issues plaguing the Indian judiciary is
the excessive tendency to litigate.
Individuals, businesses, and even government bodies
frequently turn to the courts to settle disputes, regardless of their severity or potential
for resolution outside the courtroom.
Unlike many other legal systems that encourage pre-litigation settlements,
India lacks a strong culture of alternative dispute resolution (ADR),
leading to a situation where even minor disagreements escalate into full-fledged legal battles.
Inadequate Judge-to-Population Ratio
India has one of the
lowest judge-to-population ratios in the world, with only 21 judges per million people.
By contrast,
the United States has 107 judges per million
, while the United Kingdom has around 51 judges per million.
This stark disparity means that
Indian judges are handling an overwhelming number of cases,
significantly reducing the time and attention they can devote to each matter.
Infrastructure and Resource Deficiencies
The judicial system
also suffers from severe infrastructural deficits.
Many courts operate in outdated buildings
with limited space, poor facilities, and insufficient technological integration.
Case records are often maintained manually,
making retrieval and management cumbersome.
In the absence of a robust digital case management system, courts struggle to streamline proceedings, further slowing down the judicial process.
Procedural Complexities and Delays
The adversarial system
operates within a rigid procedural framework
that, while ensuring fairness, also leads to unnecessary delays.
Litigants often file interim applications to delay proceedings strategically.
These applications require separate hearings and decisions, further extending case timelines.
process of serving summons to respondents
and examining witnesses is
often slow due to administrative inefficiencies.
Courts frequently grant adjournments due to various reasons
, including lawyer unavailability, incomplete documentation, or witness absence.
are sometimes necessary,
their overuse contributes significantly to case delays.
The Concept of Mediation: An Untapped Resource for Dispute Resolution
Mediation,
which gained traction in India in the early 2000s,
offers a viable alternative to prolonged litigation.
Unlike the adversarial system,
mediation focuses on collaborative problem-solving, with disputing parties
working with a neutral mediator to reach a mutually beneficial resolution.
method has been particularly successful in civil, commercial, matrimonial
, and property disputes.
Instead of deepening hostilities,
mediation creates dialogue and compromise
, often leading to long-term settlements rather than bitter legal battles.
One of mediation’s key advantages is its efficiency. While court cases can drag on for years,
mediation usually resolves disputes within a few sessions.
Additionally,
the costs associated with mediation are significantly lower
than litigation expenses, benefiting both individuals and the judicial system.
The process also relieves judges of excessive caseloads, allowing them to
focus on cases that truly require judicial intervention.
The Way Forward
The Need for Structural Reform
Expanding judicial capacity:
Increasing the number of judges and courtrooms will help distribute caseloads more effectively.
Modernizing court infrastructure:
Digitising records, adopting AI-based case management systems, and using video conferencing for hearings can improve efficiency.
Strengthening ADR mechanisms:
Promoting mediation, arbitration, and conciliation as primary modes of dispute resolution can significantly reduce litigation volume.
Encouraging pre-litigation settlements:
Making mediation or arbitration mandatory before litigation, particularly in commercial and civil disputes, can help filter out unnecessary cases.
Discouraging frivolous litigation:
Introducing strict penalties for baseless or repetitive cases will deter unnecessary legal action.
Implementation and Institutional Support for Mediation
For mediation to be a widespread success,
institutional support and systematic integration into the judicial process are essential.
Courts must proactively identify cases suitable for mediation
and refer them to trained mediators.
A structured framework where parties can voluntarily choose mediation, or be assigned a mediato
r when appropriate, could help in diverting a significant portion of cases from the courtroom.
India has a growing pool of skilled mediators
, including legal professionals who recognize mediation’s potential.
However,
to ensure long-term viability, mediation must transition into a full-fledged professional avenue
with adequate financial incentives for mediators.
Government agencies, businesses
, and other stakeholders
should be encouraged to adopt mediation as a standard practice
in dispute resolution.
Conclusion
While India’s judicial backlog remains a pressing concern,
it also presents an opportunity to embrace mediation as a transformative tool for justice delivery.
Rather than viewing the backlog as an insurmountable burden, the judiciary can reframe it as a resource
, a vast reservoir of cases ready for resolution through alternative methods.
By institutionalising mediation and fostering a cultural shift towards cooperative dispute resolution,
India can not only expedite justice but also promote a more harmonious and efficient legal system.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Foreign Funding; India USA relation;
Why in the News?
Recently the Indian government said that it is seriously investigating claims made by the U.S. government that USAID planned to spend $21 million to influence voter turnout in India.
What is USAID, and how did it originate?
USAID (United States Agency for International Development) was founded in
1961

Gender equality;
Why in the News?
On Friday (February 21, 2025), the Supreme Court told the Centre that schools should teach students about gender equality and how men should treat women with respect.
Is the lack of basic education about gender equality the root cause of the surge in rape cases and crimes against women?
Perpetuation of Gender Stereotypes:
Without education promoting gender equality, traditional gender norms that view women as inferior or subordinate to men persist. These stereotypes normalize the control and objectification of women.
Example:
In many societies, women are still expected to conform to rigid gender roles (e.g., being submissive or confined to domestic spaces), leading to a culture where violence against women is excused or ignored.
Lack of Consent Education:
Education about bodily autonomy and consent is often missing from curricula, leading to misunderstandings about boundaries and mutual respect in relationships.
In the 2012 Nirbhaya case in India, public outrage highlighted how a lack of understanding of consent and gender respect contributed to the brutal crime and called for reforms in legal and educational frameworks.
Normalization of Violence:
In the absence of gender-sensitive education, violence against women is often normalized or trivialized, reducing the social stigma against perpetrators and discouraging survivors from seeking justice.
A 2018 NCRB report indicated that a significant number of rape cases were
committed by individuals known to the victim,
reflecting how intimate violence is often overlooked due to cultural acceptance.
Failure to Challenge Patriarchal Mindsets:
Without education to challenge patriarchal beliefs, young minds are conditioned to accept gender hierarchies, reinforcing power imbalances that enable violence.
In rural areas of Uttar Pradesh, deeply entrenched patriarchal values have led to frequent reports of gender-based violence, underscoring the need for education to disrupt these harmful norms.
Ineffective Implementation of Gender Sensitization Programs:
Despite legal mandates like the POSH Act (2013) and initiatives for gender education, the absence of comprehensive implementation limits public understanding and societal change.
In workplaces across India, the lack of proper sensitization and training programs on gender equality has resulted in underreporting of sexual harassment cases.
Should schools include gender equality and respectful behavior in curricula?
Promotes Mutual Respect and Empathy:
Teaching gender equality helps students understand and respect diverse identities, fostering empathy and reducing discriminatory attitudes.
Programs like
UNICEF’s “Life Skills Education”
in schools across India teach students about gender sensitivity, helping reduce bullying and promoting inclusive behavior.
Prevents Gender-Based Violence:
Educating students about consent, boundaries, and respectful communication helps prevent harassment and violence from an early age.
Countries like
Sweden
have implemented
comprehensive sexuality education (CSE)
, resulting in lower rates of sexual harassment among teenagers.
Challenges Gender Stereotypes:
Curricula that question traditional gender roles empower students to pursue diverse career paths and challenge social biases.
“Breakthrough India”
runs school-based campaigns that challenge stereotypes, encouraging both girls and boys to engage in activities beyond gender norms (e.g., encouraging girls in STEM fields).
What are the steps taken by the Indian Government?
At legislative level:
Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013
: Enacted after the Nirbhaya case to expand the definition of rape, introduce stricter punishments, and criminalize stalking and voyeurism.
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012
: Provides legal protection to children against sexual abuse and exploitation.
The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (POSH) Act, 2013
: Mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in workplaces to address sexual harassment cases.
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023
: Replaces the Indian Penal Code, with enhanced provisions for sexual offenses and crimes against women.
At policy level:
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), 2015
: Aims to address the declining child sex ratio and promote the education and welfare of girls.
One Stop Centres (OSCs), 2015
: Provides integrated support and assistance to women affected by violence, including legal aid and medical assistance.
NIRBHAYA Fund, 2013
: Supports initiatives for the safety and security of women, including emergency response systems and the creation of women’s help desks in police stations.
Mahila Police Volunteers (MPV) Scheme
: Facilitates community-level support for women by appointing volunteers to assist victims in reporting crimes.
Way forward:
Integrate Comprehensive Gender Education:
Mandate gender equality and consent education across all educational levels to challenge stereotypes, promote mutual respect, and prevent gender-based violence.
Strengthen Implementation and Monitoring:
Ensure effective enforcement of gender-sensitive laws and policies through regular audits, awareness campaigns, and robust monitoring mechanisms to improve accountability and support for survivors.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the desirability of greater representation to women in the higher judiciary to ensure diversity, equity and inclusiveness.

**********Supreme Court’s Ruling on Remission
SC Judgements
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
In a historic judgment, the Supreme Court of India has ruled that prisoners eligible for remission under state policies must be considered for release even if they do not apply for it.
This decision comes as part of the suo motu case “In Re: Policy Strategy for Grant of Bail”, initiated in 2021 to address prison overcrowding.
Supreme Court’s Ruling: Key Takeaways
The SC
overruled
its earlier stance in:
Sangeet v. State of Haryana (2013)
– Held that remission was
not automatic
and required a convict’s application.
Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2013)
– Ruled that courts
cannot grant remission suo motu
The new ruling
recognizes the existence of remission policies in states
and holds that:
Prison superintendents must initiate remission
proceedings for eligible convicts.
Failure to consider
eligible prisoners for remission
violates Article 14 (Right to Equality).
What is Remission?
refers to the
reduction of a prison sentence
without altering the conviction.
It is different from
pardon or commutation
, which may involve modifying or canceling the sentence entirely.
Legal Provisions on Remission
The power of remission is governed by:
Section 473 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023
(formerly Section 432 of CrPC)
– Grants state governments the power to remit sentences
at any time
under specific conditions.
Section 475 of BNSS
(formerly Section 433A of CrPC)
Prevents remission
for life convicts guilty of crimes punishable by death
until they serve at least 14 years
Articles 72 & 161 of the Constitution
– Provide remission powers to
the President and Governors
at the Union and State levels.
Earlier, remission was initiated
only when a prisoner applied for it
, but the
new ruling removes this necessity
if states already have
structured remission policies
Impact of the Ruling on Prison Reforms
India’s prison population far exceeds capacity
, with a
131.4% occupancy rate (2022 NCRB data)
Over 75% of prisoners are undertrials
—this ruling may not directly help them, but it
could ease congestion
by enabling timely release of eligible convicts.
The new ruling ensures
all eligible prisoners get equal consideration, preventing biases in prison administration
International standards (like
UN Nelson Mandela Rules
) emphasize
prisoner rights and rehabilitation
The judgment
upholds fairness and reintegration into society
