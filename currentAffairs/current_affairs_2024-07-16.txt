Humanising Citizenship Law in India
Why in News?
The Supreme Court declared an Assam resident (Md Rahim Ali) a citizen of India, overturning the decision of a Foreigners’ Tribunal (FT) in the state.
Because of minor discrepancies in spellings and dates in the documents produced by him, the FT declared him a foreigner, holding that he had entered India illegally on or after the cut-off date of March 25, 1971.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What are Foreigners’ Tribunals?
Why are FTs under Criticism in Assam?
How the SC’s Verdict Humanised Citizenship Law in India?
The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) 2019
National Register of Citizens (NRC)
These are
quasi-judicial bodies
entrusted with determining the citizenship status of those accused of being or labelled as foreigners.
These are established as per
the Foreigners’ Act 1946 and the Foreigners’ Tribunal Order 1964.
The Foreigners Act 1946
is a colonial legislation that preceded the Constitution of India.
Post-independence, the Foreigners’ Tribunals were established in
by an executive order of the Home Ministry.
Under
Article 323B
of the Constitution (inserted by the Constitution [42nd Amendment] Act 1976), tribunals may be established (by the appropriate legislature)
by law
About 3 lakh people in Assam were declared Doubtful Voters in 1997 without any inquiry or notice. They were excluded from the Assam National Register of Citizens (NRC).
Although the Foreigners’ Tribunal Order of 1964 mandates that notices shall mention the “main grounds”,
notices issued by FTs generally do not mention any ground.
Until March 2019, as many as 1.17 lakh people had been declared foreigners, and people
had to defend themselves without knowing the charges.
This is because the Foreigners Act 1946 puts the burden of proof on the person who is alleged to be a foreigner.
The recent SC judgement could have an immediate positive bearing on the cases pending with the FTs.
On the burden of proof:
While the burden of proof may be on the accused under the Foreigners Act, the apex court held that this burden is to be discharged only after the state has shared the material on which the allegation is founded.
The supply of this material is an integral part of the classic rule of
natural justice
- no one shall be condemned unheard.
Minor discrepancies in documents cannot result in loss of citizenship:
The judgement will alleviate the anxieties of many people worried about minor spelling mistakes in their and their parents’ names following the enactment of the CAA 2019, and the proposal to have a nationwide NRC.
The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) 2019:
About:
The Act
seeks to amend the definition of illegal immigrant
for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist, Jains and Christian (but not Muslim) immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have lived in India without documentation.
They will be
granted fast track Indian citizenship in 5 years
(11 years earlier).
The Act (which amends the Citizenship Act 1955) also
provides for cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration
where the OCI card-holder has violated any provision of the Citizenship Act or any other law in force.
Who is eligible?
The CAA 2019 applies to those
who were forced or compelled to seek shelter in India
due to
persecution on the ground of religion
. It aims to protect such people from proceedings of illegal migration.
The cut-off date for citizenship is
December 31, 2014,
which means the applicant should have entered India on or before that date.
The act
will not apply to areas
covered by the Constitution's
sixth schedule
, which deals with autonomous tribal-dominated regions in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
Additionally, the act will not apply to states that have an
inner-line permit regime
(Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram).
National Register of Citizens (NRC):
About NRC:
The NRC is
an official record
of those who are legal Indian citizens. It is mandated by the 2003 amendment of
the Citizenship Act, 1955
It includes
demographic information
all the legal citizens of India
so that the illegal immigrants can be identified and deported.
So far, such a database has
only been maintained for the state of Assam
Why was NRC updated for Assam?
A writ petition had been filed before the SC demanding
the deletion of illegal migrants' names from voter lists in Assam.
In 2014,
the SC ordered the updation of the NRC
, in accordance with Citizenship Act, 1955 and Citizenship Rules, 2003 in all parts of Assam.
An individual had to demonstrate that they or their ancestors were in Assam on or before March 24, 1971.
The process officially started in 2015 and the updated final NRC was released on August 31, 2019,
with over 1.9 million applicants failing to make it to the NRC list.
Those who were not included in the final NRC
list or were tagged as 'D' (doubtful) have the right to file
an appeal with the Foreigners Tribunal.
Only Foreigners Tribunals have the authority to declare a person a foreigner.

**********Need for a stronger aviation ecosystem
Why in news?
The privatisation of Air India in 2022, transferring ownership from the government to Tata Sons, marked a significant milestone and a bold reform since the second wave of liberalisation in 2004.
This strategic transformation is anticipated to stabilize the airline sector and positively impact the entire value chain, potentially extending benefits beyond India's borders.
What’s in today’s article?
Size of Indian aviation sector
Major Fleet Expansions and Infrastructure Investments
Regulatory frameworks for the aviation sector
Way forward
Fleet expansion
Since 2022, significant developments in India's airline sector include Air India's order for a record 470 aircraft and IndiGo's rapid growth with a fleet of about 370 aircraft and more than 980 on order.
This could double the country's fleet of nearly 700 aircraft by 2030.
It took the Indian industry about 90 years from the time of the first commercial flight to reach a fleet size of 700 aircraft.
But the rate of growth is so strong that carriers could add a further 600-700 aircraft in just the next 5-7 years
Robust airline system and growth in traffic
Air India's $6.5 billion investment and IndiGo's record $1 billion profitability in FY2024 indicate a robust airline system.
Despite supply-chain challenges,
domestic and international traffic grew by 13% and 22%, respectively, in FY2024
Efforts to enhance airport infrastructure
To support this expansion, India is enhancing airport infrastructure with a $11 billion investment pipeline.
In the National Capital Region, Delhi International Airport will expand capacity to 130-140 million passengers annually, complemented by the new Noida International Airport opening in April 2025 with a 70 million capacity.
The Mumbai Metropolitan Region will also have a dual airport system, handling 145 million passengers annually.
The Adani Group is expanding capacity at six non-metro airports, and the Airports Authority of India is investing $4 billion to enhance non-metro capacity.
Greenfield airports are also planned for Chennai and Pune.
National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) 2016
guides the Indian aviation sector.
Aviation policy is broad-based in India and is dealt with by the
Ministry of Civil Aviation
under the legal framework of the
Aircraft Act 1934, and Aircraft Rules 1937
The DGCA is the
statutory regulatory authority
which comes in for issues related to safety, licensing, airworthiness, and so on.
Airports Authority of India (AAI)
manages and operates airports and provides air traffic management services.
Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS)
is responsible for laying down standards and measures for the security of civil flights and airports.
Airport Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA)
regulates tariffs and other charges for aeronautical services provided at major airports.
It also monitors performance standards of such services.
Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik)
aims to make air travel affordable and widespread by enhancing regional air connectivity through financial incentives, subsidies, and infrastructural support.
Provide incentives for investment in skilling, training, and education
The rapid growth of India's aviation industry could lead to skill shortages, particularly among technical staff like pilots, maintenance engineers, and technicians.
The new DGCA duty and rest norms for pilots could increase pilot demand by 15%.
There are also shortages in air-traffic controllers and security personnel.
Thus, the Budget should provide incentives for investment in skilling, training, and education.
Restructuring of institutions
Restructuring the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security is necessary to address challenges from technological disruptions and environmental issues.
Corporatising air traffic control by hiving off Air Navigation Services from AAI could improve capital access for system investments.
Rationalisation of taxes
The Budget should consider rationalising taxes, which currently account for nearly 20% of an airline's quarterly revenue, including state levies on aviation turbine fuel.

**********Rules for civil servants
Why in news?
The Centre has set up a single-member committee under the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) to review the documents submitted by IAS probationer Puja Khedkar, who secured a rank of 821 in the 2022 UPSC Civil Services Examination.
Khedkar was allotted the IAS under the OBC and Physically Handicapped quotas. Questions have been raised about her appointment under these categories.
It should be noted that Khedkar’s actions as a civil servant are governed primarily by two rules: the
All-India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968
, and
the Indian Administrative Service (Probation) Rules, 1954
What’s in today’s article
Rules on 'integrity of services'
Rules for probationers
Allegations against Khedkar
All IAS, Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS) officers are governed by the All-India Services (Conduct) Rules from the time they join their respective services, and begin their probation period.
Integrity and Devotion to Duty
According to Rule 3(1)
, officers must uphold absolute integrity and dedication to their duties at all times.
Gifts and Benefits
Rule 11(1)
regulates the gifts and benefits received by a civil servant.
Acceptance of gifts is limited to those from near relatives, with strict reporting requirements for any gift exceeding Rs 25,000 to prevent influence on their duties.
This rule also prohibits officers from engaging in any trade or business to maintain impartiality and prevent conflicts of interest.
Unbecoming of an officer
Rule 4(1) is more specific about what is unbecoming.
It states that officers must not use their position or influence to secure employment for any member of his family with any private undertaking or NGO.
Property details
Rule 13
of the All-India Services (Conduct) Rules mandates that officers must annually submit property returns.
These returns must detail all immovable properties that officers or their family members own, inherit, acquire, or hold through lease or mortgage.
This requirement ensures transparency and prevents illicit accumulation of wealth among civil servants.
Sub-rules added in 2014
In 2014, the government added a few sub-rules.
This included that officers should maintain:
high ethical standards, integrity and honesty;
political neutrality;
accountability and transparency;
responsiveness to the public, particularly to the weaker sections;
courtesy and good behaviour with the public.
There is an additional set of rules that govern the conduct of officers during their probation period, which lasts for at least two years after selection to the services.
IAS officers, in addition, are governed by the IAS (Probation) Rules during their probation period.
Probation Conditions
Officers undergo training at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussoorie.
At the end of two years, they must pass an examination to be confirmed in their service.
Salary and Allowances
Probationers receive a fixed salary and travel allowance but do not have entitlements like an official car, official accommodation, or an official chamber with staff.
Probationer Discharge
Rule 12
outlines circumstances under which probationers can be discharged, such as being found ineligible or unsuitable for the service by the central government, neglecting duties, or lacking essential qualities needed for the service.
Enquiry Process
If disciplinary action is initiated against a probationer, a summary enquiry is conducted by a committee appointed by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT).
The committee submits its report within two weeks to inform decisions regarding the probationer's status.
Puja Khedkar, despite her low rank, secured a position in the prestigious IAS through reservations meant for OBC and Persons with Disabilities (PH).
Since the batch of 1995, 27% seats in the services have been reserved for the OBC category.
The PH reservation was introduced with the batch of 2006 — 3% seats in every category (General, OBC, SC, and ST) are reserved for the differently abled.
However, allegations have surfaced regarding the validity of her OBC and PH certificates.
If these allegations are proven true — that she falsified these certificates — Khedkar faces potential discharge from service.
Probationers are discharged, while confirmed officers are dismissed.
The issue is compounded by a legal battle over her PH status, where she failed to attend a medical examination required by the UPSC, citing reasons including a Covid-19 infection.
Critics have raised questions about her eligibility for
OBC (non-creamy layer) benefits
, highlighting her family's background in politics and her father's former government service.
For those whose parents work in the private sector, the current threshold to qualify for the non-creamy layer status is an
income of under Rs 8 lakh annually
For those with parents who work in the public sector, income is not taken into account.
Rather, as per DoPT rules, what qualifies people to be in the creamy layer is either parent becoming a Group-A official before the age of 40, or both being Group-B officials with similar ranks.

**********ISRO has a problem: many rockets, but too few satellites to launch 
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Satellite launching vehicles; ISRO;
Mains level:
ISRO; Present Scenario of Satellites in India;
Why in the News?
After the ambitious
Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV)
was finalized in June 2024, ISRO Chairman S. Somanath stated its launch capability exceeded demand threefold, highlighting a need for robust domestic market demand for launch vehicles.
What is the present scenario of Satellites in India?
India operates a
diverse fleet of satellites
with applications in
Communications, Remote Sensing, Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), Meteorology, Disaster Management, Space-based internet, Scientific missions, and Experimental missions.
India currently has four main launch vehicles:
Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV),
Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV),
Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV),
and the
Launch Vehicle Mark-III (LVM-3),
capable of launching satellites up to four tonnes to geosynchronous orbit.
For satellites weighing more than
, India relies on foreign launch vehicles, such as Europe’s Ariane V and SpaceX’s Falcon 9, to meet its heavy payload requirements.
India has been actively involved in significant space missions like
Chandrayaan 3 (a lunar mission)
Aditya L1 (a mission to study the Sun)
, showcasing its growing capabilities in space exploration.
Existing Demand-Driven Model in India – Before and After
Before (Supply-Driven Model)
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) primarily built and launched satellites based on its assessments and planned missions without waiting for specific customer demands.
After launching satellites, ISRO would then look for
customers who needed the services
provided by the satellites, which sometimes led to underutilization or delayed utilization of satellite capabilities.
The space sector was
heavily government-controlled
, with limited involvement and investment from private players
There was
less emphasis on educating potential customers
about the benefits and applications of space-based services, leading to lower demand from various sectors.
After 2020 (Demand-Driven Model)
The Space sector reforms 2019-2020 encouraged greater private sector participation, fostering innovation, competition, and commercialization in the Indian space industry.
Satellites are now built and launched based on confirmed customer demands, ensuring that each satellite has a predefined purpose and user base before it is sent into space.
The market demand for satellite services is validated and secured before the construction and launch phases, leading to better alignment of resources and higher utilization rates.
Major Three Limitations Associated at Present Time:
Limited Launch Vehicle Capability:
Currently, the Indian launch vehicles have restricted payload capacities, necessitating multiple launches for larger missions, increasing costs and complexity.
Demand-Supply Mismatch:
Transitioning from a supply-driven to a demand-driven model faces challenges, including the need to educate potential customers and create a robust private sector ecosystem.
Economic and Technological Constraints:
High costs of developing and maintaining launch vehicles and satellites, coupled with the early stages of implementing cost-effective reusable technologies, and insufficient infrastructure and investment.
Way forward:
Enhance Launch Vehicle Capacity:
Invest in research and development to upgrade existing launch vehicles like GSLV and LVM-3 to increase payload capacity, reducing dependence on foreign launch providers.
Strengthen Market Engagement and Education:
Expand outreach programs to educate potential customers across sectors about the benefits and applications of satellite-based services.
Promote Private Sector Participation:
Facilitate a conducive regulatory environment to attract private investments and foster innovation in satellite manufacturing and launch services.
Mains PYQ:
India has achieved remarkable successes in unmanned space missions including the Chandrayaan and Mars Orbiter Mission, but has not ventured into manned space missions. What are the main obstacles to launching a manned space mission, both in terms of technology and logistics? Examine critically.

What is a Money Bill?
Mains level:
Present challenges to Money Bill
Why in the News?
CJI D.Y. Chandrachud has accepted the plea to list petitions challenging the
passage of contentious legislation in Parliament
This has given rise to the expectation that the matter could be heard and decided before Chandrachud demits office in November this year.
Presently, the three key issues are referred to the 7-judge bench in the Supreme Court:
Amendments made post-2015, like the
Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)
through Money Bills, giving the Enforcement Directorate wide powers, were valid or not.
Whether the passage of the
Finance Act of 2017
as a Money Bill to alter appointments to 19 key judicial tribunals was valid or not
In the Aadhaar case, the Supreme Court had in 2018 upheld the
Aadhaar Act as a valid Money Bill.
However, in 2021, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud (who was then a part of the bench) had dissented, saying the larger questions on Money Bills should be decided first before reviewing the Aadhaar judgment.
Now, the current Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud has agreed to list the petitions
challenging the use of the Money Bill route
by the Centre to pass contentious amendments, indicating he will constitute a 7-judge Constitution Bench to hear this matter.
A Money Bill is a specific type of financial legislation that exclusively deals with matters related to
taxes, government revenues, or expenditures.
It is defined under
Article 110
of the Indian Constitution.
Every Money Bill is a Finance Bill but every Financial Bill is not a Money Bill:
A Financial Bill can cover a broader range of financial issues, whereas a Money Bill is specifically limited to the matters mentioned in Article 110 of the Constitution. Therefore, while every Money Bill is a Financial Bill, not every Financial Bill is a Money Bill.
Key provisions of the Money Bill:
Article 110(1)(a):
Imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of any tax
Article 110(1)(b):
The regulation of borrowing by the government or giving of any guarantee by the government or the amendment of the law for any financial obligations undertaken by the government
Article 110(1)(c):
Custody of the
Consolidated Fund
Contingency Fund of India
, the payment of money into or the withdrawal of money from any such Fund.
Article 110(1)(d)
Appropriation of money out of the
Consolidated Fund of India
Article 110(1)(e):
Declaration of any expenditure to be expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India or the increase of the amount of any such expenditure
Article 110(1)(f):
Receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund of India or the public account of India or the custody or issue of such money or the audit of the accounts of the Union or of a State
Article 110(1)(g):
Any matter incidental to any of the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f).
What are the present challenges associated with the Parliament?
Circumvention of the Rajya Sabha:
The government is accused of misusing the Money Bill provision to evade scrutiny of the Bill by the Rajya Sabha where it was numerically weaker as compared to the Lok Sabha where it enjoyed pre-eminence.
Contentious Amendments passed as the Money Bill:
Aadhaar Act, 2016; amendments to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002; amendments to the Foreign Contributions Regulations Act, 2010; Finance Act, 2017 which brought about changes in the mode of appointment of judicial tribunals; electoral bonds scheme brought through Finance Act, 2017.
For example, the
, passed as a Money Bill, altered the appointment processes for judicial tribunals, which was seen as an attempt to extend executive control over these institutions.
The Supreme Court has been involved in multiple such cases questioning the classification of certain bills as Money Bills. For instance, the Rojer Mathew case and the Aadhaar case (K. Puttaswamy case)
Finality of the Speaker’s Decision:
The Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision to certify a bill as a Money Bill has been contested. The judiciary has debated whether this decision is final or subject to judicial review.
Way forward:
Need for strengthening Judicial Oversight:
Establish clear guidelines and criteria for the classification of bills as Money Bills, ensuring they strictly adhere to the provisions outlined in
Requires the Reinforcement of Legislative Procedures:
Enhance the role of the Rajya Sabha in the legislative process by ensuring that all significant amendments, especially those affecting governance structures or individual rights, undergo thorough scrutiny in both houses of Parliament.
Mains PYQ:
The Indian Constitution has provisions for holding joint session of the two houses of the Parliament. Enumerate the occasions when this would normally happen and also the occasions when it cannot, with reasons thereof.

**********What is Maharashtra’s new bill to combat Naxalism in urban areas?   
Security Issues
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Federal issues and Internal security;
Mains level:
Naxalism in India;
Why in the News?
The Maharashtra state government has introduced a comprehensive new legislation –
Maharashtra Special Public Security (MSPC) Bill, 2024
,  to address the growing incidence of Naxalism in urban areas.
The Maharashtra government claims that Naxalism is
no longer limited to remote rural areas
, but has now spread its influence to urban centers through
“frontal organizations”
The government argues that existing laws like the
Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA
) and
Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act
are not sufficient to effectively control these urban Naxal organizations.
Key provisions drafted under the MPSC Bill, 2024:
Declaration of Unlawful Organisation:
The bill empowers the government to declare any suspect organization as an unlawful organization, targeting entities supporting or associated with Naxal activities in urban areas.
Offenses and Penalties:
It outlines four primary offenses – membership in an unlawful organization, fundraising for such organizations, managing or assisting them, and engaging in unlawful activities. Penalties range from two to seven years of imprisonment and fines up to Rs 5 lakh.
Cognizable and Non-Bailable Offenses:
Offenses under the bill are cognizable, allowing arrest without a warrant, and non-bailable, which means individuals accused can be detained pending trial.
Lower Threshold for Unlawful Activity:
Unlike the UAPA, the bill sets a broader and less defined threshold for what constitutes “unlawful activity,” including acts perceived to threaten public order, disrupt law enforcement, or incite disobedience to law.
Speedy Prosecution:
The bill streamlines the prosecution process by allowing district magistrates or police commissioners to grant permissions, circumventing the need for central or state government sanctions as required under UAPA.
Why it is being seen as a threat to civil liberty:
Broad Definitions:
Critics argue that the bill’s definitions of unlawful activities are overly broad and vague, potentially encompassing legitimate acts of dissent, protest, or advocacy that are essential in a democratic society.
Lack of Judicial Oversight:
Unlike the UAPA, which involves a judicial process for designating an organization as unlawful, the MSPC Bill places this authority with an advisory board. This shift reduces judicial oversight and increases executive control over legal proceedings.
Impact on Freedom of Expression:
By criminalizing acts such as generating fear in the public or encouraging disobedience to law without clear definitions, the bill could curtail freedom of expression and assembly, essential rights in a democratic society.
Preventive Detention:
The provision for non-bailable offenses and cognizable offenses without warrants increases the risk of preventive detention, potentially leading to arbitrary arrests and prolonged detention without due process.
Constitutional Concerns:
Critics, including civil liberties organizations like the People’s Union for Civil Liberties, argue that the bill violates constitutional protections of freedom of speech, assembly, and association by stifling dissent and legitimate protest under the guise of national security.
Way forward:
Consultative Process:
The Maharashtra government should engage in a consultative process with legal experts, civil society organizations, and stakeholders to refine the bill’s provisions, ensuring they align with constitutional principles and international human rights standards.
Safeguarding Rights:
Introduce safeguards such as judicial oversight in the process of declaring organizations unlawful, ensuring that fundamental rights like freedom of expression and assembly are protected while addressing legitimate security concerns effectively.
Mains PYQ:
Naxalism is a social, economic and developmental issue manifesting as a violent internal security threat. In this context, discuss the emerging issues and suggest a multilayered strategy to tackle the menace of Naxalism.

India’s apex drug regulator
Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)
gave preliminary approval to the drug
Tirzepatide.
is known to have assisted in weight control treatment among diabetic patients.
About Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO):
CDSCO is India’s
national regulatory body
for
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and medical devices
It serves a
similar function to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
of the US or the European Medicines Agency of the European Union.
The Indian government has announced its plan to bring
all
medical devices, including implants and contraceptives
under a review of the CDSCO.
Within the CDSCO, the
Drug Controller General of India (DCGI)
regulates pharmaceutical and medical devices and is positioned within the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
The DCGI is advised by the
Drug Technical Advisory Board (DTAB)
and the
Drug Consultative Committee (DCC).
Mandate and Responsibilities:
Drug Approval:
CDSCO is responsible for the approval of new drugs and clinical trials.
Standards Enforcement:
Ensures standards of drugs and medical devices through various acts such as the
Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.
Import and Export:
Regulates the import and export of drugs and medical devices in India.
Licensing Authority:
Issues licenses for the manufacture, sale, and distribution of drugs in India.
Surveillance:
Conducts drug quality surveillance and monitors adverse drug reactions.
Diabetes Drug for Weight Loss
In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called
Ozempic
for managing type 2 diabetes.
The active ingredient,
semaglutide
, was later noted for causing weight loss, which led to its off-label use for treating obesity.
This usage became popular on social media, influencing further developments.
What is Tirzepatide?
Tirzepatide is the main component of Eli Lilly’s drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.
It’s important to note here that Mounjaro is the brand name for diabetes, while Zepbound is for weight loss.
How does it work?
There is a dual action involving two hormones:
(1) Regulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1):
GLP-1 is a hormone that regulates appetite and calorie intake through effects on the brain and digestive tract.
Both semaglutide and tirzepatide function as polypeptides that enhance the body’s levels of GLP-1.
The higher levels of GLP-1 trigger satiety, the feeling of fullness, reducing the desire to eat.
(2)
Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP):
Unlike semaglutide, tripeptide also increases levels of GIP, the other hormone involved.
Promising Global Trials
Global clinical trials for
(Zepbound)
have shown significant results, with the highest dosage leading to an average
weight loss of 20.9% over 72 weeks
The approval in India is due on further post-marketing surveillance (
Phase IV trials
) to monitor the drug’s side effects and its effectiveness across India’s diverse population.
Long-term side effects:
Cardiovascular risks like increased heart rate and potential blood pressure elevation.
Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation. Endocrine concerns involve thyroid C-cell tumours in MEN syndrome patients.
Other issues include kidney problems, eye complications, mental health impacts, and long-term risks like pancreatic enzyme elevation and gallbladder problems.
Why under-consideration in India?
India has the
world’s second-highest
number of people with
and high obesity
rates.
A study in Lancet in 2023
estimated that
101 million people
in India — 11.4 per cent of the country’s population — are living with diabetes.
As per the
World Obesity Federation Atlas
, around
11 per cent of Indian adults
will be
obese by 2034
**********Uniform IGST Rate of 5% on Aircraft and Aircraft Engine Parts
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
IGST; MRO industry of India.
Why in the News?
The government has implemented a
uniform Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST)
rate of
on all aircraft and aircraft engine parts.
Background:
Prior to the implementation of GST in 2017, the taxation of aircraft and aircraft parts was complex, with different central and state taxes being levied.
Under the pre-GST regime, aircraft parts attracted a range of taxes, including excise duty, VAT, and additional customs duties, leading to a cascading effect and higher costs for the aviation industry.
IGST Harmonization for MRO Boost:
This move is aimed at boosting
Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO)
activities in India.
Previously, GST rates on aircraft components varied between 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, causing several issues.
MRO Industry in India
The Indian MRO industry is projected to become a
$4 billion industry by 2030
Currently, India represents only
1% of the global MRO market
, which is worth
US$45 billion
The industry is divided into airframe maintenance,
engine maintenance (50-55% of work value)
, components maintenance, and line maintenance (weekly checks).
Commercial airlines spend
13-15% of their revenues on maintenance
, primarily outsourcing heavy maintenance.
What is Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST)?
The IGST is a component of the GST system in India.
It is
levied by
central government
on:
Inter-state /UT supply of goods and services;
Imports of goods and services;
Supply of goods and services to/by SEZ units;
Deemed exports (certain transactions where goods supplied do not leave the country but are treated as exports under GST law).
IGST is calculated by
adding
the applicable
Central GST
(CGST) and
State GST
(SGST) rates.
One thing to remember in IGST is that the
importing state gets the accrued benefit
of taxes.
Rationale for the Uniform 5% IGST Rate
Simplification of Tax Structure:
A uniform 5% IGST rate on aircraft and engine parts simplifies tax compliance and eliminates classification complexities.
Cost Efficiency:
A lower IGST rate reduces overall tax burden on aviation industry, enhancing affordability of aircraft acquisition and maintenance.
Global Alignment:
Aligns India’s tax policy with global standards, fostering competitiveness and attractiveness for international aviation investments.
Promotion of Aviation Services:
Encourages aircraft leasing and MRO activities, supporting India’s aspiration to become a hub for these services.

**********100 years of Electroencephalography (EEG)
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
EEG and its working
Why in the News?
This year marks the 100th anniversary of the
first human electroencephalography (EEG)
by
German physiologist Hans Berger
.
Historical Development of EEG
The development of EEG started with
Richard Caton
1875
, who first noticed electrical signals in the brains of animals.
His work was
expanded by Adolf Beck
and later by
Vladimir Pravdich-Neminsky
, who recorded the
first EEG of a
dog
was the
first to record these signals
from a
human brain
1924
What is EEG?
EEG stands for electroencephalography. “
” means electricity, “
” refers to the brain, and “
” means recording.
It tracks the
electrical activity in the brain
that happens when
neurons,
the brain’s cells,
move tiny charged particles.
This helps doctors tell
if the brain is working normally
or not.
Doctors use EEG
to diagnose
epilepsy
, check
how deep a person is under anesthesia
, study sleep patterns, and even
confirm if a person has passed away
Understanding Volume Conduction
Volume conduction explains
how the brain’s electrical signals move through different layers
like skin and bone to reach the electrodes on the scalp.
electrodes pick up
need to be cleaned up from any distortions caused by these layers or other noises before doctors can read them accurately.
How does an EEG Test Works?
Neurons interact with their surroundings and sometimes
push ions around
This movement
creates waves of electrical activity
Electrodes
on the head
detect these waves and measure how strong they are
, which is then recorded as an EEG.
Setting up an EEG involves
putting gel on the head
placing electrodes accurately
, which can be affected by things like having thick hair.
What EEG Can and Can’t Show?
Strengths
: EEG is very good at catching fast changes in the brain’s electrical activity, which is helpful for immediate observations.
Limitations
: It mainly detects signals from the surface of the brain and is better at picking up signals from certain types of cell parts than others.
Pinpointing exactly where the brain an activity started can be difficult.
Cost and Accessibility
simple and affordable
compared to other methods like MRI.
It’s
portable
, doesn’t use large equipment, and is safe.
