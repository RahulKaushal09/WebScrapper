Stick to Fiscal Deficit as the Norm for Fiscal Prudence
Context
The
management of fiscal deficit and government debt is a critical aspect of economic policy
in any country, and India is no exception.
balance between government expenditures and revenues
plays a pivotal role
in determining the overall health of the economy.
Therefore,
it is important to explore the complexities of managing fiscal deficit and debt in India,
particularly in the context of recent developments and historical precedents.
The 1980s Fiscal Crisis
1980s marked a period of economic difficulty for India,
characterised by a rising fiscal deficit and escalating government debt.
This
situation led to a severe balance of payments crisis
and a high ratio of interest payments to revenue receipts.
government was forced to borrow progressively more to meet its developmental expenditures,
which worsened the debt situation.
period highlighted the dangers of allowing fiscal imbalances to persist, as the government found itself trapped in a cycle of borrowing and debt repayment
that left little room for productive investments or economic growth.
The 2024-25 Union Budget Fiscal Targets and Gaps in the Announcement
In the final
Union Budget for 2024-25, the Indian government acknowledged the need to address fiscal imbalances
and set forth ambitious targets for reducing the fiscal deficit and government debt.
finance minister announced that starting from 2026-27
, the government's goal would be to ensure that
the central government debt is on a declining path
as a percentage of GDP.
Specifically,
the Budget projected a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26,
down from the budgeted level of 4.9% in 2024-25.
At this level,
the debt-GDP ratio is estimated to be 54% by 2025-26,
assuming a nominal GDP growth rate of 10.5% over the next two years.
Unclear Roadmap for Achieving Sustainable debt-GDP Ratio
Beyond these immediate targets,
the government has not provided a clear roadmap
for achieving a
sustainable debt-GDP ratio in the long term.
decision to abandon the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act's 2018 target
of reducing the debt-GDP ratio to 40% for the central government and 60% for the combined government
indicates a shift in fiscal policy.
Instead of adhering to a fixed target,
the government now aims to maintain a gradually declining debt-GDP ratio,
which could stretch well into the future.
An Overview of the Combined Fiscal Deficit and Its Economic Implications
The Combined Fiscal Deficit
India's fiscal responsibility framework is
not limited to the central government
;
it extends to the states as well.
Under their respective Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRLs),
state governments are required to maintain a fiscal deficit target of 3% of their Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).
These
targets are designed to ensure that states maintain fiscal discipline
, control their borrowing, and contribute to the overall economic stability of the country.
If both the central and state governments maintain fiscal deficits of 4.5% and 3% of GDP respectively,
the combined fiscal deficit could reach 7.5% of GDP for several years.
Such a high combined deficit has profound implications
for the broader economy, particularly in terms of investment and economic growth.
Crowding Out Private Investment
concept of crowding out refers to a situation where increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates
, which in turn reduces private sector investment.
India's current context, where household financial savings have been on the decline
, this crowding-out effect
could be particularly pronounced.
For instance,
in 2022-23, household financial savings were 5.3% of GDP
, a significant drop from 7.6% in the preceding four years (excluding the COVID-19 year of 2020-21).
With only 5.3% of household savings and approximately 2% of net inflow of foreign capital
, the available
investible surplus of 7.3% would be fully absorbed by the government's combined fiscal deficit of 7.5% of GDP.
Fiscal Imbalances and Long-term Economic Stability
high combined fiscal deficit also raises concerns
about long-term economic stability.
Persistent fiscal imbalances can lead to a vicious cycle of increasing debt
and rising interest payments.
As the government borrows more to finance its deficit, the debt level increases
, leading to higher interest payments.
These interest payments, in turn, consume a larger share of government revenue
, leaving less available for other essential expenditures such as infrastructure development, education, and healthcare.
Risks of Fiscal Indiscipline at the State Level
One of the risks of the central government's shift in fiscal policy is that it may set a precedent for fiscal indiscipline
at the state level.
State governments might perceive the central government's abandonment of strict fiscal targets as
a signal that they too can relax their fiscal discipline
without facing serious consequences.
could lead to a situation where states accumulate higher levels of debt without a clear plan for repayment
, ultimately exacerbating the overall fiscal burden on the country.
International Comparisons, Challenges and Policy Recommendations
International Comparisons and Challenges Before India
comparisons reveal that India’s interest payments to revenue receipts ratio is much higher
than that of other countries with similar or even higher levels of government debt-GDP ratios.
For example,
during 2015-19, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States had interest payment to revenue receipts ratios of 5.5%, 6.6%, and 8.5%, respectively.
In contrast, India's combined interest payment to revenue receipts ratio averaged 24% during the same period
, with the central government's post-transfer ratio averaging 49%.
Policy Recommendation: The Need for Coordinated Fiscal Discipline
To
prevent such outcomes, it is crucial that both the central and state governments adhere to a coordinated approach
to fiscal discipline.
While some flexibility in fiscal policy may be necessary
to respond to economic shocks or development needs,
this should not come at the cost of long-term fiscal sustainability.
central government should work closely with states to ensure that any relaxation of fiscal targets is temporary
and accompanied by a clear plan for returning to sustainable debt levels.
Incentives for States
Additionally,
the central government could consider providing incentives for states that adhere to fiscal discipline
, such as access to additional grants or favourable borrowing terms.
By
aligning the interests of the central and state governments
India can achieve a more balanced and sustainable fiscal policy
that supports economic growth without jeopardising financial stability.
Conclusion
While the government's recent fiscal targets are a step in the right direction
the lack of a clear roadmap
sustainable debt-GDP ratio raises concerns.
Furthermore,
the high levels of interest payments relative to revenue receipts, coupled with declining household financial savings,
limit the available investible surplus for the private sector, potentially
hindering economic growth.
Moving forward,
it is crucial for India to adopt a more disciplined fiscal approach, with a focus on reducing the fiscal deficit and debt-GDP ratio to sustainable levels
, thereby ensuring long-term economic stability.

**********La Niña and its Impact on the Indian Climate
Why in News?
This year's La Niña forecasts from all of the top international agencies were wildly inaccurate. In this context, there is a need to analyse the likely impact of delay in La Niña’s onset and why did global weather models get their predictions wrong.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Phenomenon of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)?
What is El Nino and La Nina?
Comparing El Nino, La Nina with Normal Conditions
Latest Predictions of La Nina and Impact of Delayed Onset on the Indian Monsoon
The ENSO is a phenomenon
characterised by changes in sea temperatures
along the tropical Pacific Ocean due to atmospheric fluctuations overhead.
The ENSO has three phases
- warm (El Nino), cool (La Nina) and neutral/normal, which occurs in irregular cycles lasting anywhere from two to seven years.
Because it
disrupts the global air circulation and affects weather patterns worldwide
, ENSO is a major contributor to the variability of the natural climate on a global scale.
(or ‘The Little Girl’ in Spanish) and
(or ‘The Little Boy’ in Spanish) are two opposing climate trends that deviate from the normal conditions and normally run 9 to 12 months.
(which is more frequent than La Nina)) is typically known as the
warm phase
of ENSO, in which a band of warmer water spreads from west to east in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
On the other hand,
is identified as the
cold phase
of ENSO, in which a band of cooler water spreads east-west in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
Both El Nino and La Nina can have global effects on
weather, wildfires, ecosystems and economics.
Comparing El Nino, La Nina with Normal Conditions:
During the neutral/normal phase
, the eastern Pacific (off the northwestern coast of South America) is cooler than the western Pacific (around Philippines and Indonesia).
This is because prevailing trade winds - caused by Earth’s rotation, between 30 degrees north and south of the equator - move east to west.
This sweeps warmer surface water along with them and relatively cool waters from below rise to the surface to replace the displaced water.
During the El Niño phase
, these wind systems weaken, leading to lesser displacement of warmer waters off the American coasts.
As a result, the eastern Pacific becomes warmer than usual.
The opposite happens in the La Niña phase
, trade winds become stronger than usual and push larger quantities of water to the western Pacific.
In India
, El Niño is associated with suppressed rainfall during the monsoon season, while La Niña is known to help monsoon activity.
The effects of El Niño and La Niña-related risks, such as high temperatures, heavy precipitation, and droughts, have been
intensified due to anthropogenic climate change.
Latest Predictions of La Nina and Impact of Delayed Onset on the Indian Monsoon:
Latest Predictions of La Nina:
One of the longest recorded
episodes lasted from 2020 to 2023 and the previous
event occurred between June 2023 and May 2024, following which ENSO entered the
neutral phase
The latest predictions
suggest that the earliest signs of the onset of La Niña will likely emerge by the end of September or in early October.
La Niña would peak in November, and is expected to last throughout the winter in the northern hemisphere.
Initial projections
suggested that the onset of La Niña conditions would occur around July.
The error
in predicting La Niña’s onset is because of the fact that weather models are likely to better pick up signals in cases of strong La Niña or El Niño phases, rather than weak ones.
Impact of Delayed Onset on the Indian Climate:
Southwest monsoon (June - September):
A delayed La Niña onset does not definitely mean an adverse monsoon performance.
For example
, the IMD predicted a 109% ‘above’ normal rainfall over most geographical areas this monsoon season.
But there are
wide variations in precipitation
at the regional level.
For example,
almost every state in the east and the northeastern region have seen deficient rainfall.
Northeast monsoon season (October - December):
Also known as the winter monsoon, this is limited to Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, southern interior Karnataka and Kerala.
Though La Niña does not favour northeast monsoon rainfall, there have been exceptions in the past.
Cyclogenesis:
The north Indian Ocean basin - which covers the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea - sees peak cyclone activity during May and November.
During La Niña years,
there are high chances of frequent cyclogenesis
, with storms having above-average intensity and longer-than-average life.
Winter season:
La Niña years in the past have typically seen harsher, colder winters.

**********Conservationists demand NTCA to withdraw relocation of forest-dwelling communities from  tiger reserves
Why in news?
Conservationist organizations across India have called for the withdrawal of what they term the "illegal" relocation of villagers from tiger reserves, ordered by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).
A notification issued on June 19, 2024, identified 89,808 families from 848 villages for relocation. The NTCA directed state authorities to prioritize relocating residents from core areas of tiger reserves, emphasizing time-bound action plans for the process. Conservationists oppose this directive, arguing it threatens the rights of forest-dwelling communities.
What’s in today’s article?
News Summary
About
It has been constituted in 2006 under the provisions of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The authority consists of:
Minister in charge of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (as Chairperson),
Minister of State in the Ministry of Environment and Forests (as Vice-Chairperson),
three members of Parliament, Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests and other members.
Nodal Ministry
- Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC)
Objectives
Providing statutory authority to Project Tiger so that compliance of its directives become legal.
Fostering accountability of Center-State in management of Tiger Reserves, by providing a basis for MoU with States within our federal structure.
Providing for an oversight by Parliament.
Addressing livelihood interests of local people in areas surrounding Tiger Reserves.
Powers and functions
to approve the tiger conservation plan prepared by the State Government
evaluate and assess various aspects of sustainable ecology and disallow any ecologically unsustainable land use within the tiger reserves
lay down normative standards for tourism activities and guidelines for project tiger from time to time for tiger conservation in the buffer and core area
ensure that the tiger reserves and relevant areas are not diverted for ecologically unsustainable uses, except in public interest and with the approval of the National Board for Wild Life and on the advice of the Tiger Conservation Authority
News Summary:
Directive issued by NTCA
NTCA recently issued a directive to 19 states, urging them to prioritize the relocation of villagers from core tiger zones, drawing strong opposition from conservationist groups and activists.
In a letter, the NTCA highlighted that 591 villages, comprising 64,801 families, still reside in core tiger areas, and the slow progress of relocation raises concerns for tiger conservation.
Similar letters were sent to other states, with Karnataka having already relocated 1,175 families from 81 villages since 1973.
Tiger reserves and core zone
A Tiger Reserve consists of:
a ‘Core’ or ‘Critical Tiger Habitat’, which is to be managed as an inviolate area, and
a ‘Buffer’ or Peripheral area, which may be accorded a lesser degree of habitat protection.
Core zones
in tiger reserves are designated areas where
human activities, such as hunting and forest produce collection, are prohibited
, while
buffer zones
regulated restrictions
There are
53 tiger reserves in India
across 19 states with 848 villages in the core zone, of which 257 villages have been relocated since Project Tiger began.
The Wildlife Act mandates core zones to be "inviolate" through voluntary relocation on agreed terms.
Concerns raised by wildlife activists
The activists claim that the residents mostly belong to the Adivasi and other forest-dwelling communities.
They are entitled to live and use the forest produce for their livelihood as enshrined in the Forest rights Act, 2006 [FRA] as well as The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 [WLPA].
They stated that the displacement from 19 tiger states could be the largest such exercise ever conducted across the world touted as an objective for the conservation of wildlife.
They warned that such a move would result in conflicts between state authorities and the STs and other traditional forest dwellers (OTFDS) living within the tiger reserves.
This step
exposes these communities to vulnerabilities such as economic and social insecurities, destitution and disruption of their eco-cultural fabric
They point out that provisions under WLPA prohibits the apex tiger authority to issue any directives that interfere with the rights of local people, especially the Scheduled Tribes.
It also highlighted that the decision also violates the conservation efforts towards biodiversity and wildlife which these communities depend on for their sustenance.

**********Judicial Appointments Can't Be Individual Decision - Supreme Court
Why in news?
The Supreme Court ruled that a Chief Justice of a High Court does not have the authority to individually reconsider recommendations for a judge's elevation. Instead, any reconsideration of such recommendations must be done collectively by the High Court Collegium.
The observations were made in a verdict granting relief to two District Judges from Himachal Pradesh, Chirag Bhanu Singh and Arvind Malhotra.
Their candidatures for elevation to the Himachal Pradesh High Court were directed to be decided afresh by the High Court Collegium.
What’s in today’s article?
Procedure to appoint judges of High Courts
Background of the current case
Key highlights of the verdict
Constitutional Provision
Article 217
of Indian Constitution covers the appointment and conditions of a High Court Judge.
It says that every Judge of a High Court shall be
appointed by the President
by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State.
In the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court shall also be consulted.
The Chief Justice of the High Court is appointed as per the policy of having Chief Justices from outside.
Eligibility
A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a Judge of a High Court unless he is a citizen of India and—
has for at least ten years held a judicial office in the territory of India; or
has for at least ten years been an advocate of a High Court in any State specified in the First Schedule or of two or more such Courts in succession.
A High Court judge holds office until they are
62 years old
A Collegium comprising the CJI and two senior-most judges recommends the names for the appointment for Judges of HCs.
However, this process is initiated by the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned.
Chief Justice of the High Court is also required to consult his two senior-most puisne Judges
before recommending a name for appointment to the High Court.
The recommendation is sent to the Chief Minister, who advises the Governor to send the proposal to the Union Law Minister.
Controversy over the Word Consultation
The constitutional provision gave the CJI and other judges the status of consultant and left the decision of appointment to the executives.
This has been interpreted by the SC in a different way ultimately leading to the evolution of Collegium system.
Evolution of Collegium System
First Judges Case (1982)
SC held that consultation does not mean concurrence
Gave Primacy to Executive
Second Judges Case (1993)
Court reversed its earlier ruling by changing the meaning of consultation to concurrence.
Advice tendered by CJI is binding.
CJI would take into account the views of two of his senior most colleagues.
Third Judges Case (1998)
Court gave primacy to the opinion of CJI in the matter of appointment of Judges.
However, Chief Justice must consult four senior most judges of SC.
Opinion of all members of the collegium should be in writing.
Initial recommendation and decision of SC Collegium
In December 2022, the Himachal Pradesh High Court Collegium recommended District Judges Chirag Bhanu Singh and Arvind Malhotra for elevation as judges of the High Court.
Later, the Supreme Court Collegium deferred consideration of their elevation in July 2023.
In January 2024, the apex court remitted the proposal for reconsideration to the Chief Justice (CJ) of the High Court.
Ministry of Law and Justice's Intervention
In January 2024, the Law and Justice Minister urged the High Court CJ to send fresh recommendations for the two officers against vacancies in the service quota.
High Court CJ's Actions and subsequent case in Supreme Court
The High Court CJ instead recommended two other names for elevation, disregarding Singh and Malhotra.
This action was challenged by the two before the Supreme Court, where they argued that considering others ahead of them would undermine their seniority and unblemished record.
The HC CJ had
addressed the SC Collegium about the petitioners' suitability, without collective consultation with other Collegium members.
Key highlights of the judgement by the Supreme Court in present case
The process of judicial appointments is not the prerogative of a single individual
It is a collaborative and participatory process involving all Collegium members.
The underlying principle is that
the process of appointment of judges must reflect the collective wisdom that draws from diverse perspectives
Such a process ensures that principles of transparency and accountability are maintained.
Is judicial scrutiny of Collegium decisions permissible?
Through this judgement, the apex court held that
limited judicial scrutiny of Collegium decisions is permissible
to determine whether the decision taken by the Collegium was done after effective and collective consultation of its members.
The Bench summed up the
following legal principles
that emerged from precedents on the subject:
‘Lack of effective consultation’ and ‘eligibility’ falls within the scope of judicial review;
‘Suitability’ is non-justiciable and resultingly,
the ‘content of consultation’ falls beyond the scope of judicial review
