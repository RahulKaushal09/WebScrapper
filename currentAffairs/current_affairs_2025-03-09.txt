**********India promises to buy more U.S. oil
Why in news?
India plans to increase its oil and natural gas imports from the U.S., following Prime Minister Modi’s meeting with President Trump in February. Indian officials stated that energy purchases could rise from $15 billion to $25 billion.
A Reuters report showed that U.S. crude exports to India reached 3,57,000 barrels per day in February, up from 2,21,000 bpd last year.
What’s in today’s article?
India's Commitment to U.S. Energy Imports
Expanding U.S. Energy Supply to India
India’s Growing Oil and Gas Demand
India’s Diversified Energy Strategy
India’s Growing LNG Demand
Conclusion
India, the world's third-largest oil importer, has agreed to increase its oil and gas purchases from the U.S.
This is to strengthen energy ties and secure hydrocarbon supplies, crucial for meeting its 85% import-dependent crude oil needs.
Boost to Bilateral Trade
This move aligns with efforts to double U.S.-India bilateral trade to $500 billion over the next five years.
Currently, trade favors India, with a $45.7 billion goods trade surplus in 2024, a 5.4% rise from 2023.
Diversifying Energy Sources
According experts, increasing U.S. energy imports will enhance India’s supply diversity and strengthen long-term energy security.
India aims to establish the U.S. as a key supplier of crude oil, petroleum products, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to diversify its energy sources and enhance security.
Strengthening Hydrocarbon Trade and Investments
Both countries have agreed to increase trade in hydrocarbons, including ethane and petroleum products, while boosting investments in oil and gas infrastructure and fostering collaboration between energy companies.
Broader Energy Cooperation
Discussions also covered strengthening civil nuclear energy ties and U.S. support for India's full membership in the International Energy Agency (IEA).
In 2023-24, India imported 234.26 million tonnes of crude oil, with import dependence rising to 87.8%.
Domestic production remained stagnant at 29.36 million tonnes, covering less than 13% of total demand.
Despite similar import volumes, the import bill fell to $133.37 billion due to lower global prices, compared to $157.53 billion in 2022-23.
Petroleum and LNG Imports
India spent $22.93 billion importing 48.69 million tonnes of petroleum products like LPG and fuel oil while exporting 62.59 million tonnes worth $47.72 billion.
The country also imported 31.80 billion cubic metres (bcm) of LNG for $13.405 billion in 2023-24, up from 26.30 bcm in the previous fiscal.
Strategic Focus on Clean Energy and U.S. LNG
India aims to increase natural gas consumption from 6% to 15% of its energy mix, strengthening ties with the U.S. as a key LNG supplier.
If sanctions on Russia are lifted, Europe may resume Russian gas imports, prompting the U.S. to expand its customer base and secure new markets.
While strengthening energy ties with the U.S., India continues to engage with multiple suppliers, including Brazil, Argentina, Suriname, Canada, and Guyana, to ensure supply security and price stability.
Russia’s Growing Role in India’s Oil Imports
Since the Ukraine war, Russia has become a key crude oil supplier to India, offering discounted prices amid G7-imposed sanctions.
India purchased Russian crude worth €49 billion in the third year of the conflict.
Shift in India's Oil Sourcing
Traditionally reliant on West Asia, India’s imports from Russia surged from less than 1% to 40% of its total crude oil imports within a short period, making Russia a dominant supplier.
India’s natural gas consumption is projected to reach 103 billion cubic meters (bcm) annually by 2030.
After a decade of slow growth, demand surged by over 10% in both 2023 and 2024, signaling a turning point.
Domestic Production and Supply Challenges
Domestic gas production, which met 50% of demand in 2023, is expected to rise to nearly 38 bcm by 2030.
However, India will still rely heavily on LNG imports to meet its growing energy needs.
Key Drivers of Growth
Three major factors—rapid infrastructure expansion, recovering domestic production, and an expected easing of global gas market conditions—are driving India’s gas market transformation.
Strategic Planning for Energy Security
With a wave of new global LNG supply expected, India must ensure supply security through strategic planning and market coordination to maintain competitiveness in its price-sensitive energy market.
The government is implementing a multi-pronged approach to reduce import dependency by promoting alternative energy sources and domestic production. India is expanding the use of ethanol, compressed biogas, and biodiesel to substitute crude oil demand and enhance energy security.
The country is actively developing EV charging infrastructure to support the transition to cleaner mobility and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

The Chagos Archipelago
Negotiations Over the Chagos Archipelago’s Sovereignty
India-Mauritius Relations - A Brief Overview
Significance of Indian PM’s Visit to Mauritius
Conclusion
It is
a group of seven atolls
comprising
over 60 islands in the Indian Ocean
about 500 kilometres (310 mi) south of the Maldives archipelago.
This chain of islands is the
southernmost archipelago of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge
, a long submarine mountain range in the Indian Ocean.
From 1715 to 1810
, the Chagos Islands were part of
France's
Indian Ocean possessions.
Under the Treaty of Paris (1814)
, France ceded the Islands to the
United Kingdom
became the British Empire's main sugar-producing colony and remained a primarily sugar-dominated plantation-based colony until independence (in 1968).
In 1965
, three years before Mauritius became independent, the UK split off the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritian territory, to form the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).
Diego Garcia
- the largest island of the Chagos Archipelago, has been used as a
joint UK–U.S. military base since the 1970s.
The UK and Mauritius
have been engaged in
prolonged negotiations
over the archipelago’s sovereignty.
The UK and the US
have reached a political agreement
to retain a strategic military base on Diego Garcia
while
restoring Mauritius' sovereignty over the rest of Chagos
On October 3,
2024
, the UK announced that a treaty was being formalized to solidify the agreement.
India-Mauritius Relations - A Brief Overview:
India has close and long-standing relations with Mauritius
, anchored in shared history, demography and culture.
A key reason for the special ties
is the fact that Indian origin people comprise nearly 70% of the island’s population of 1.2 million.
Mauritius was one of the handful of important countries with which independent India
established diplomatic relations in 1948
, even before the independence of Mauritius.
Both shares uniquely close cooperation in maritime security
, development partnership, capacity-building, cooperation in international fora, vibrant cultural exchanges, etc.
India has traditionally been the ‘
First Responder
’ for Mauritius in times of crisis, including during the recent Covid-19 and Wakashio oil-spill crises.
Cumulative FDI
worth USD 175 billion has come from Mauritius to India since 2000 (25% of total FDI inflows into India), thanks largely to the bilateral Double Taxation Avoidance Convention (DTAC).
Mauritius and India signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement (
CECPA
). After coming into force (1 April 2021), this became the
first
trade agreement signed by India with an African country.
Foreign Secretary Misri described Mauritius as
a close maritime partner of India
Indian Air Force contingents and an Indian Navy ship will participate in Mauritius' national day celebrations.
This visit marks PM Modi’s
return to Mauritius after his last visit in 2015
Several agreements are expected
to be signed during the visit, strengthening bilateral cooperation.
PM Modi’s visit to Mauritius underscores India’s commitment to
deepening strategic, economic, and diplomatic ties with the island nation.
The Chagos issue remains a critical aspect of India’s foreign policy, reflecting its broader stance on
decolonization and regional stability.

**********Provisions of New Income Tax Bill
Why in the News?
The New Income Tax Bill which was introduced in the Lok Sabha last month, is expected to come into effect from April 1, 2026.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context)
About New Income Tax Bill (Key Provisions, Reasons for Introducing Changes, Concerns, etc.)
Introduction:
The Indian government has introduced the new
Income Tax Bill, 2025
, which aims to modernize the country’s
six-decade-old
tax framework by streamlining tax provisions, removing outdated references, and incorporating new regulations.
A key highlight of this bill is the
explicit inclusion of virtual digital spaces
within the ambit of tax searches and seizures.
This means that
tax officers will now have the power to access digital assets, including social media, email accounts, online investments, and trading platforms
, as part of their investigations into tax evasion.
The bill, introduced in
, is currently under review by the
Parliamentary Select Committee
and is expected to come into effect on
once passed.
Key Provisions of the New Income Tax Bill:
, expands the definition of assets subject to search and seizure. Some of the crucial provisions include:
Defining Virtual Digital Space:
The bill introduces a legal definition of virtual digital space, encompassing all digital realms where users interact, communicate, and conduct activities via computers or digital platforms.
Power to Override Access Codes:
Tax authorities will have the power to override access codes to enter virtual digital spaces, such as social media accounts, email servers, and digital trading platforms, if required during tax investigations.
Expansion of Search & Seizure Under Section 247:
While Section 132 of the existing Income Tax Act, 1961, already allows authorities to inspect and seize electronic records, the new bill specifically includes digital spaces as assets that can be accessed for tax audits.
Inclusion of Digital Documents as Taxable Assets:
The bill explicitly recognizes digital documents, computer systems, and encrypted financial records as assets liable for taxation scrutiny, alongside traditional assets like money, bullion, and real estate.
Mandated Cooperation from Account Holders:
Under Section 132(1)(iib), individuals in possession of electronic records, accounts, or documents must facilitate access to tax authorities by providing necessary credentials for audits.
Reasons for Introducing These Changes:
The expansion of tax authorities’ powers into
stems from the
increasing digitization of financial transactions
and the
rise of digital tax evasion
Addressing Tax Evasion in Digital Spaces:
Authorities often face challenges in detecting concealed income and undisclosed transactions occurring through online wallets, crypto assets, or offshore accounts.
The new bill closes this loophole by ensuring that digital records can be investigated similarly to physical records.
Enhancing India’s Direct Tax Framework:
The bill aims to simplify India’s tax structure while making provisions more transparent and effective in addressing emerging financial fraud techniques.
Aligning with Global Standards:
Many developed economies already have provisions that allow tax authorities to inspect digital transactions and encrypted financial accounts.
The new law brings India’s tax regime in line with global best practices.
Potential Concerns and Controversies:
While the bill is intended to modernize taxation, several concerns have been raised regarding:
Privacy & Data Protection:
Critics argue that overriding digital access codes could compromise user privacy, leading to potential misuse of personal data by tax authorities.
Increased Compliance Burden on Businesses:
Companies and individuals may face additional scrutiny, requiring them to maintain and disclose digital records for audits, increasing compliance costs.
Potential Misuse of Power:
Some fear that tax authorities might misuse search and seizure powers, leading to harassment of individuals or businesses without adequate justification.
Impact of the New Bill:
For Individuals:
Digital financial transactions will be more closely monitored by tax authorities.
Individuals using offshore accounts, cryptocurrency platforms, or social media trading should be prepared for increased scrutiny.
For Businesses:
Companies will need to ensure complete digital compliance in financial reporting.
The cost of legal and digital record-keeping may increase.
For Tax Authorities:
The bill provides enhanced power to tax officers in investigating undisclosed digital transactions.
It aligns Indian tax laws with the global digital economy.
Conclusion:
The New Income Tax Bill, 2025, represents a significant step toward modernizing India's tax system by including digital assets under the purview of tax investigations.
While the law seeks to curb tax evasion and streamline direct taxation, it has also raised concerns about privacy and compliance burdens.
As the bill moves forward in Parliament, discussions around balancing tax enforcement with privacy rights will be crucial in ensuring fair and transparent implementation.
