Having Private Participation in India’s Nuclear Energy
Context
The
Union Budget for FY 2024-25 included a proposal for partnerships with the private sector to research and develop Bharat Small Reactors (BSR), Bharat Small Modular Reactors (BSMR),
and other nuclear energy technologies.
This
move is aligned with India’s broader goal of generating 500 Gigawatts of non-fossil fuel energy by 2030,
as pledged at the COP26 Summit in 2021.
However,
this ambitious plan faces numerous legal, regulatory, and financial hurdles
that must be addressed for the successful involvement of private entities in the nuclear sector.
Existing Legal Framework Governing the Nuclear Sector and SC’s Judgement on Private Sector Participation
India’s nuclear energy sector
operates under a stringent regulatory framework
, primarily governed by the
Atomic Energy Act, 1962 (AEA).
AEA grants exclusive control over nuclear energy activities to the central government,
which
executes these through designated authorities or companies
, such as the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL).
centralised control has historically limited private sector involvement to specific roles,
primarily in
engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services
, while excluding private entities from core activities like research and development (R&D).
SC’s Decision on Private Sector Participation
In a significant legal development, the
Supreme Court of India recently upheld the provisions of the AEA in the case Sandeep T.S. vs Union of India (September 2024).
judgement dismissed a petition challenging the law’s restrictions on private sector participation
in nuclear power licensing.
Court emphasised the importance of stringent safeguards
due to the potential risks associated with atomic energy.
ruling reinforces the central government's dominance over nuclear energy activities
, which complicates efforts to introduce private players in a meaningful capacity.
The Current Role of Private Sector, Need for Private Sector Participation, and the Government’s Proposal
The Current Role of the Private Sector
Currently, private companies such as Megha Engineering & Infrastructures and Reliance are involved in nuclear energy projects, but only in non-core areas
, primarily through EPC contracts.
These
companies build and maintain the physical infrastructure
of nuclear plants, but they are
restricted from engaging in activities related to nuclear material management
operations that involve handling radioactive substances.
Need for Private Sector Participation: Capital Investment
nuclear sector is highly capital-intensive,
and the scale of investment required for further expansion, especially with advanced technologies like BSR and BSMR, is enormous.
NITI Aayog has estimated that nearly $26 billion of private investment
will be needed
to develop the nuclear sector to meet India’s energy goals.
Given the financial burden on the government, involving private firms in more substantial roles could provide the necessary capital,
technical expertise, and innovation.
such participation is currently prohibited under Section 3(a) of the AEA,
which bars private companies from producing or utilizing atomic energy, keeping R&D activities strictly under government control.
The Government’s Proposal
government’s proposal to invite private participation in nuclear R&D
, as announced in the Union Budget 2024-25, therefore,
clashes with the prevailing legal restrictions.
While the
announcement signals a policy shift
, any real progress would require substantial amendments to the AEA or the creation of a legal framework.
new provisions should balance the involvement of private entities with government oversight to mitigate risks
related to nuclear safety, security, and liability.
Legal Challenges Surrounding Private Sector Participation in India’s Nuclear Energy
Strict Provisions of Atomic Energy Act
One of the primary legal hurdles for private sector involvement is the
rigidity of the AEA, which monopolises control of nuclear activities
under the government.
legal structure ensures that only government-owned or controlled entities,
such as the NPCIL and the DAE,
manage nuclear energy production.
While this structure has maintained a high level of safety and security,
it significantly hampers the ability to leverage private sector efficiency
, innovation, and investment.
Legal Environment Around Nuclear Safety and Liability
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) of 2010 is a central piece of legislation designed to provide prompt compensation for victims of nuclear incidents
and to impose liability on the operator (usually the NPCIL).
CLNDA enforces a no-fault liability regime on nuclear operators
, meaning that the operator is liable for damages irrespective of fault.
This provision, while intended to protect public safety, also disincentivises private participation
because private entities would likely hesitate to invest in an industry where they may bear enormous liability in case of an accident.
Complex Regulatory Framework and Lack of Transparency
The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB),
established to monitor radiation safety and regulate nuclear technology,
has faced criticism for lacking independence from the government.
AERB’s perceived lack of autonomy could hinder private investment
, as companies may seek more transparent and impartial regulatory oversight before committing to such a high-risk industry.
Nuclear Safety Regulatory Authority (NSRA) Bill of 2011, which aimed to establish an independent nuclear safety body, has yet to be enacted
, leaving unresolved concerns about regulatory transparency and effectiveness.
The Path Forward for Private Sector Participation in India’s Nuclear Energy
Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
A key legal avenue that
could bridge the gap between current regulations and private sector involvement is the creation of PPP
in the nuclear energy sector.
In a PPP structure,
the government could retain a majority stake, 51% or more, in nuclear projects,
ensuring that control and accountability remain with the state while allowing private companies to contribute capital and technical know-how.
approach would align with Section 3(a) of the AEA,
which limits the involvement of private players, while still leveraging private sector resources for the development of newer nuclear technologies such as SMRs and modular reactors.
Moreover,
under a PPP structure, projects would be subject to the Right to Information (RTI)
Act, promoting transparency and public accountability.
By holding the majority stake,
the government would remain responsible for critical decisions and the safety of the reactors
private entities would be involved in more specialised roles such as technology development, innovation
, and infrastructure creation.
Need for Regulatory Reform
For private investment to materialise,
regulatory reform is essential.
role of the AERB, for instance, must be reevaluated
to ensure that it functions with greater independence and impartiality.
Investors will only feel confident entering the nuclear sector if they are assured that safety regulations are enforced
by an autonomous and technically competent regulatory body.
Resolution of Pending Litigation Regarding the CLNDA
ambiguity surrounding nuclear liability creates a significant obstacle
to private sector involvement.
A clear and stable legal environment, where liability is well-defined and manageable, will encourage private entities
to participate more actively.
could potentially be achieved through amendments to the CLNDA that clarify the extent of operator liability,
as well as government-backed insurance schemes to cover catastrophic incidents, thereby sharing the burden of liability between the state and private players.
Conclusion
ambitions
are both
admirable and challenging.
introduction of private sector participation, especially in the context of BSRs and BSMRs, could provide the financial and technological boost
necessary to achieve the country’s decarbonization goals.
this shift must be accompanied by comprehensive legislative and regulatory reforms,
particularly in areas such as liability, safety, and transparency.

**********Key Facts about Kosi River
Several regions of Bihar are facing severe flooding due to the heavy release of water from the Kosi Barrage in Birpur, following intense rainfall.
About Kosi River:
It is a
transboundary river
which flows through
China, Nepal and India.
It is a prominent
tributary of the Ganges.
Course:
Origin:
The river Kosi is formed by the
confluence of three streams
, namely the Sun Kosi, the Arun Kosi, and the Tamur Kosi, all of which have their origin in the
Himalayan region of Nepal and Tibet.
About 30 miles (48 km) north of the Indian-Nepalese frontier, the Kosi is joined by several major tributaries and breaks southward through the
Siwalik Hills
at the narrow
Chatra Gorge.
The river then emerges on the
great plain of northern India
in Bihar state on its way to the Ganges River, which it enters south of Purnea after a course of about 450 miles (724 km).
The Kosi drains an area of 74,500
sq.km
, of which only 11,070
lie within Indian Territory.
Kosi River valley is bounded by steep margins that disconnect it from the Yarlung Zangbo River
to the north, the
Mahananda River
to the east, the
Gandaki
to the west, and the
Ganga
to the south.
Because of its great outflushing of debris, the Kosi has
no permanent channel
in its course
through the great plain of northern India
It is well known for its
tendency to change course
generally in a westward direction. During the last 200 years, the river has shifted westwards for a distance of about 112 km and has laid waste large tracks of agricultural land.
Kosi is known as the "
sorrow of Bihar",
as it has caused widespread human suffering in the past due to flooding and very frequent course changes when it flows from Nepal to Bihar.
Tributaries
: It has seven major tributaries:
Sun Koshi, Tama Koshi or Tamba Koshi, Dudh Koshi, Indravati, Likhu, Arun,
Tamore
or Tamar.

**********Tsetse flies
According to a new atlas published by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Tsetse flies are present in 34 African countries.
About
Tsetse flies:
Tsetse flies (genus Glossina) are unicellular
blood-sucking insects.
They are
holometaboulos insects
, females giving birth to full-grown larvae which rapidly pupate in the soil.
They are arranged taxonomically and ecologically into three groups:
the fusca, or forest
, group (subgenus Austenina); the morsitans, or
savanna, group
(subgenus Glossina); and the palpalis, or
riverine, group
(subgenus Nemorhina).
Habitat:
They are found in local patches of dense vegetation along
banks of rivers.
Also found in lakes in arid terrain, and also in dense, wet, heavily forested equatorial rainforest
They feed on blood and
transmit the Trypanosoma parasites,
which are responsible for sleeping sickness in humans and animal trypanosomosis or "
Nagana" in cattle.
They are also linked to
nagana in African livestock,
resulting in annual agricultural losses estimated in the billions of dollars.
The collected data confirmed the presence of Glossina species in 34 countries, ranging from Northern Senegal (around 15 degrees north) to South Africa (Kwazulu-Natal province at 28.5 degrees south).

**********Overseas Citizen of India
Recently, the Consulate General of India in New York has clarified that rumours circulating on social media regarding Overseas Citizen of India (OCIs) becoming reclassified as “foreigners” are false.
About
Overseas Citizen of India:
The
Overseas Citizen of India (OCI)
scheme was introduced in
August 2005
which provides for registration of
all Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs)
who were citizens of India on January 26, 1950, or thereafter, or were eligible to become citizens of India on the said date.
Who cannot be an OCI?
An applicant is
not eligible
to get an OCI card if his/her parents or grandparents have ever been
a citizen of Pakistan or Bangladesh.
Foreign military personnel
either in service or retired are also not entitled to grant of OCI.
However, the spouse of foreign origin of a citizen of India or spouse of foreign origin of an OCI, whose marriage has been registered and subsisted for
not less than two years,
can apply for an OCI card.
Advantages of OCI cardholders:
An OCI card holder — essentially a foreign passport holder — gets a multiple entry,
multi-purpose life-long visa
for visiting India,
and is exempt from registration with local police authority for any length of stay in the country.
The OCI cardholder is
Not entitled to vote;
to be a member of a Legislative Assembly or of a Legislative Council or of Parliament; to hold Indian constitutional posts such as that of the President, Vice President, Judge of the Supreme Court or High Court.
He or she cannot normally hold employment in the government.
Latest rules regarding OCIs
On March 4, 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a gazette notification amending the rules regarding OCI card holders.
These rules required OCI card holders to
seek permission or a permit to visit protected areas in India.
The same restrictions apply to foreign nationals visiting Jammu & Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh.
They need to secure a
special permit
to undertake “
any research
”, to undertake any “missionary” or “Tablighi”
or “journalistic activities”
or to visit any area in India notified as “protected”, “restricted” or “prohibited”.
They are at par with “foreign nationals” in respect of “all other economic, financial and educational fields” for the purposes of the

**********Telecom Ministry to Disconnect 2.17 Crore Mobile Connections Amid 'Cyber Slavery' Concerns
Why in news?
The Union Ministry of Telecommunications has informed a high-level inter-ministerial panel that it will disconnect 2.17 crore mobile connections obtained through forged documents or used in cybercrime, and block 2.26 lakh mobile handsets.
What’s in today’s article?
Background
Cyber scams and fraud are increasingly common in India, often involving spam calls where scammers pose as government officials to steal sensitive information like Aadhaar and ATM details.
To avoid detection, these scammers now operate from foreign countries but use Indian mobile numbers to make their calls seem legitimate.
This shift has given rise to a dangerous trend called
'cyber slavery,'
where individuals are lured abroad under false job promises and forced to participate in cybercrime operations.
About
Cyber slavery refers to a modern form of exploitation where individuals are lured, often through deceptive job offers, and forced to engage in cybercrimes.
Victims are usually promised lucrative jobs, such as data entry or tech roles, in foreign countries, particularly in Southeast Asia.
Upon arrival, their passports and identification documents are confiscated, trapping them in a form of digital servitude.
These individuals are coerced into performing illegal online activities, such as cyber fraud, phishing, and scamming.
They may be forced to create fake social media profiles or lure people into fraudulent investment schemes, like fake cryptocurrency platforms.
Victims often work under harsh conditions, with no freedom of movement, and face threats or violence if they attempt to escape.
Cause of worry
Cyber slavery is part of a broader pattern of
human trafficking
and is increasingly prevalent due to the rise of
digital crimes
It highlights the intersection of human rights violations and online criminal networks, requiring international cooperation to combat.
Indians trapped as cyber slaves
A report revealed that over 5,000 Indians were believed to be ensnared in Cambodia, allegedly held against their will and compelled to commit cyber fraud.
Government estimates suggest that Indians had been defrauded of at least Rs 500 crore in the six months leading up to March of this year.
Analysis of data by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) has observed an increase in the number of cybercrime incidents targeting India.
About 45% of them originate from the Southeast Asia region, mainly Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos PDR.
Inter-ministerial panel formed to address the issue
This incident prompted the Indian government to establish an inter-ministerial panel to address the issue and pinpoint the loopholes.
The panel identified deficiencies in the banking, immigration, and telecom sectors.
It identified three loopholes that enable cyber scams originating from Southeast Asian countries. These are:
Involvement of the senior bank managers of two nationalised banks to open mule accounts;
It was found that maximum accounts were allegedly opened with the connivance of senior bank managers/ staffers in several branches of State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank.
around 30,000 unreturned passengers travelling on visitor visa to Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam from January 2022-May 2024; and
misuse of bulk SIM cards.
Steps taken by Indian government
The Union Ministry of Telecommunications has announced to:
disconnect approximately 2.17 crore mobile connections obtained through forged documents or used in cybercrime and
DoT has also directed telecom companies to block all incoming international spoofed calls that display Indian mobile numbers.
This has resulted in a 35% drop in such calls, with full implementation expected by December 31 of this year.
Additionally, the DoT is working to identify roaming phone numbers involved in scams in Southeast Asia.
The DoT reported that over 6 lakh Indian SIM cards were roaming in Southeast Asia between April and June 2023.
Over 1.4 lakh point of sale (PoS) agents across India were identified as being involved in selling SIM cards used in scam operations in countries like Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos.
Telecom service providers (TSPs) are required to submit weekly data on Indian mobile numbers utilizing roaming services in countries like Hong Kong, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, and Myanmar

**********Export ban on Non-Basmati White Rice lifted
Why in news?
Recently, the Indian government lifted the ban on the export of Non-Basmati White Rice. However, it set a minimum export price (MEP) of $490 per tonne.
Earlier, the government had removed the 20% export duty on Non-Basmati White Rice and reduced the export duty on three other rice categories: 'rice in the husk (paddy or rough)', 'husked (brown) rice', and 'parboiled rice' from 20% to 10%.
What’s in today’s article?
Rice Cultivation
Rice Production in India
India’s status as a rice exporter
Crop Season
Rice is primarily grown during the
Kharif season (June to November)
, which coincides with the monsoon.
In some areas, it is also grown in the
Rabi season (November
to April), particularly in irrigated regions like Tamil Nadu and coastal Andhra Pradesh.
Climatic Conditions
Rice thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity. It requires:
Temperature:
An average temperature of 21°C to 37°C. The ideal temperature for germination is around 21°C, while the growing period requires temperatures above 25°C.
Rainfall:
Rice needs plenty of water. It requires 150-300 cm of rainfall during the growing period, ideally distributed evenly throughout the season.
Soil Conditions
Rice grows best in clayey or loamy soils that retain water.
Alluvial soils in river basins and coastal areas are also ideal for rice cultivation. The soil should be deep, fertile, and capable of holding moisture.
Water Requirements
Rice is a water-intensive crop, usually grown in flooded fields (paddy fields). Adequate irrigation is necessary in areas with insufficient rainfall.
Area of cultivation for rice
In fiscal year 2024, India had an estimated
47.
6 million hectares of land area
India is the second-largest producer of rice globally, and the largest exporter.
India's rice production in 2023-24 is estimated to be 1378.25 lakh metric tons (LMT), a 20.70 LMT increase from the previous year.
State's share in rice production
Rice is produced in the coastal strips on the eastern and western pockets of the country, the plains of Assam in the north-east, and the foothills of the Himalayas.
Statistics
India is the second-largest rice producer and the largest exporter globally, contributing significantly to world rice trade.
Along with China, India accounts for over half of the world's rice production. While China is the largest consumer, leaving little for export, India plays a dominant role in the export market.
According to the USDA, India accounted for 33% (17 million tonnes) of the world’s total rice exports (53 million tonnes) in 2023.
In 2022, before the Non-Basmati White Rice export ban, India contributed about 40% of the global rice exports (56 million tonnes).
India’s export breakup
India’s rice exports are divided into two main categories: basmati and non-basmati rice.
Basmati rice accounts for nearly one-third of India’s total rice exports, with 52.42 lakh tonnes exported in 2023-24.
Non-basmati rice has six subcategories: rice in husk (seed quality and other), husked (brown) rice, parboiled rice, non-basmati white rice, and broken rice.
Export destination
The primary destinations for Indian rice exports in 2023-24 are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Benin, United Arab Emirates, Guinea, Senegal, Togo, and Yemen.
Saudi Arabia was the leading importer of Indian rice in terms of export value, mainly purchasing basmati rice varieties.
Non-basmati white rice went to Kenya, Mozambique, Cameroon, Vietnam, Malaysia, Togo, Madagascar, Cote D’ Ivoire, and Benin in the biggest quantities.
India’s competitor
Two east Asian countries—
Thailand and Vietnam
—are the two main competitors of India in the global rice market.
In 2023, the combined rice export of these two countries was almost equal to Indian exports.
Besides, Pakistan, Cambodia and the United States are also in the list of rice exporters.
Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, European Union, Nigeria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are the
top rice importers
About the news
The Centre has lifted the ban on export of Non-Basmati White Rice. It has, however, imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of $490 per tonne.
Reasons behind lifting the ban
Higher Sowing of Paddy
India has seen an increase in paddy sowing due to a good monsoon, with most of the crop being planted during the kharif season.
By September 20, 2023, the paddy cultivation area reached 413.50 lakh hectares, a 2.2% increase over last year.
Record Rice Production
India’s total rice production for 2023-24 (kharif, rabi, and summer) is estimated at 137.82 million tonnes, a 1.5% increase compared to last year.
Declining Wholesale Prices, Stable Retail Inflation
On September 27, the wholesale price of rice was Rs 3,324.99 per quintal, down from Rs 3,502.91 a month ago.
However, retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index has remained in double digits for the past two years, peaking at 13.09% in July 2023.
Inflation dropped to 9.52% in August after the government’s export ban.
Surplus Rice Stocks
As of September 1, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) held 323.11 lakh tonnes of rice in its Central pool.
Including unmilled paddy, the total stock amounted to 423 lakh tonnes, well above the required buffer stock norms of 135.40 lakh tonnes for July and 102.50 lakh tonnes for October.
Who will get benefitted?
The lifting of the ban will benefit traders, who previously paid a 20% duty, and is expected to improve export sentiment.
Farmers growing premium varieties like
Sona Masoori
(mainly in
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana
) are likely to benefit, as they were impacted by the ban.
However, for domestic consumers, already high retail prices may increase further.

**********India’s Current Account Deficit Widens to $9.7 billion
What’s in Today’s Article?
Definition of Key Economic Terms
Background (Context of the Article)
Key Factors Contribution to the Deficit (Trade Deficit, Transfer Receipts, etc.)
Definition of Key Economic Terms:
Current Account Deficit (CAD):
The current account deficit occurs when a country's total imports of goods, services, and transfers exceed its total exports. It represents a negative balance of trade and reflects the extent to which a nation is borrowing or using its foreign reserves to finance its spending.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP):
GDP is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period. It is a broad measure of overall domestic production.
Merchandise Trade Deficit:
A trade deficit occurs when a country’s imports exceed its exports of goods (or merchandise). The merchandise trade balance specifically refers to the balance of physical goods traded internationally.
Net Services Receipts:
These are the earnings a country receives from its services sector (e.g., IT services, transportation, travel) minus the payments it makes for services imported from abroad.
Private Transfer Receipts:
These represent the remittances sent by individuals working abroad to their home country. They are an important source of foreign exchange inflows for many developing countries.
Primary Income Account:
This account in the balance of payments reflects income flows between residents and non-residents, such as dividends, interest, and wages. A net outflow means that more payments were made abroad than received.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):
FDI refers to the investments made by a foreign entity or individual into the business assets of another country, typically in the form of ownership stakes in companies, real estate, or infrastructure.
Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI):
FPI refers to investment in financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, in another country without the intention of controlling the company. It is generally more short-term and volatile compared to FDI.
External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs):
ECBs are loans or borrowings made by a country or its corporations from non-resident lenders in foreign currencies.
Non-Resident Indian (NRI) Deposits:
These are deposits made by Indians living abroad into accounts in India, often benefiting from favorable interest rates and contributing to the country's foreign exchange reserves.
Foreign Exchange Reserves:
These are assets held by a central bank in foreign currencies, which can include bonds, treasury bills, and other government securities. They are used to back liabilities and influence monetary policy.
Background:
India’s current account deficit (CAD) expanded marginally in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25).
According to the data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently, the CAD reached $9.7 billion, which
is equivalent to 1.1% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
This marks
an increase from $8.9 billion (1.0% of GDP) during the same period in the previous year
, Q1 FY24.
Furthermore, it represents a stark contrast to the surplus of $4.6 billion (0.5% of GDP) recorded in the fourth quarter of FY24 (Q4 FY24).
Key Factors Contributing to the Deficit:
One of the primary reasons for the widening of the CAD is the increase in the merchandise trade deficit.
The trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of a country’s imports and exports, grew to $65.1 billion in Q1 FY25, compared to $56.7 billion in Q1 FY24.
growth in imports, particularly in sectors such as oil, gold, and other non-oil products, was a significant contributor to this phenomenon
Services and Private Transfer Receipts:
On a positive note, India's net services receipts improved year-on-year (y-o-y) from $35.1 billion in Q1 FY24 to $39.7 billion in Q1 FY25.
This rise was seen across major service categories, including:
Computer services
Business services
Travel services
Transportation services
Additionally,
private transfer receipts, primarily remittances from Indians working overseas, increased from $27.1 billion in Q1 FY24 to $29.5 billion in Q1 FY25
, reflecting the continued growth in inflows from expatriates.
The net outgo on the primary income account, which mainly represents payments of investment income, increased slightly from $10.2 billion in Q1 FY24 to $10.7 billion in Q1 FY25.
This reflects the payments made on returns to foreign investments in India.
Financial Account:
In terms of the financial account, the data presented several shifts:
Net FDI inflows rose to $6.3 billion in Q1 FY25, up from $4.7 billion in Q1 FY24, indicating continued investor confidence in India.
On the other hand, net inflows under FPI decreased significantly from $15.7 billion in Q1 FY24 to just $0.9 billion in Q1 FY25.
ECBs also saw a decline, with net inflows falling from $5.6 billion in Q1 FY24 to $1.8 billion in Q1 FY25.
Net inflows from NRI deposits were higher, reaching $4.0 billion in Q1 FY25 compared to $2.2 billion in the same period last year.
: India's foreign exchange reserves increased by $5.2 billion in Q1 FY25 on a Balance of Payments (BoP) basis. However, this was a substantial decline from the $24.4 billion accretion seen in Q1 FY24.
Expert Commentary:
As per experts, the overall balance of payments situation remained largely stable for Q1 FY25.
As per them, the $5.2 billion net accretion to foreign exchange reserves as a positive, although it was lower than the $24.4 billion in the previous year.
Both oil and gold imports contributed to the widening trade deficit, along with other non-oil imports.
They said that
while the CAD at 1.1% of GDP was higher than last year’s 1%, it was still within a comfortable range

What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI)?
Manufacturing Sector in India
Highlights of the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for 2022-23
About:
ASI is the principal source of industrial statistics and data for
organised manufacturing
in India and is conducted by the
National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)
under the MoSPI.
It has been
conducted since 1959
under the Collection of Statistics Act 1953. Presently, the survey is being conducted under
the Collection of Statistics Act 2008
as amended in 2017 and Rules framed there under in 2011.
Objective:
The Survey is designed to obtain comprehensive and detailed data -
Estimating the
contribution
of the registered manufacturing sector as a whole
to Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
of the Country and also by type of industry,
Systematic studying the
structure of the industries
Studying various factors influencing the industries for formulation of
industrial policies.
The survey covers:
Factories
registered under the Factories Act 1948. It relates to factories employing 10 or more workers using power and those employing 20 or more workers without using power.
For states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Goa
, data is collected for factories employing 20 or more workers with power and factories having 40 or more workers without power.
Bidi and cigar manufacturing establishments
under the Bidi and Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act 1966, and
All electricity undertakings
engaged in generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, not registered with the Central Electricity Authority (CEA).
Significance:
The survey results
give valuable input
to the planners and policy makers in objectively evaluating the industrial scenario of the economy.
Manufacturing Sector in India:
Manufacturing is emerging as
an integral pillar
in the country’s economic growth, thanks to the performance of key sectors like
automotive, engineering, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and consumer durables.
With
17% of the nation’s GDP and over 27.3 million workers
, the manufacturing sector plays a significant role in the Indian economy.
India is gradually progressing on the road to
Industry 4.0
through the Government of India’s initiatives like -
National Manufacturing Policy
which aims to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP to
25% by 2025
Production Linked Incentive (PLI)
scheme for manufacturing which was launched in
to develop the core manufacturing sector at par with global manufacturing standards.
Highlights of the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for 2022-23:
Main drivers of the manufacturing growth in 2022-23:
These were industries related to
basic metal, coke & refined petroleum products, food products, chemical and chemical products and motor vehicles
These industries (taken together) contributed about
58% of the total output
of the sector and showed output growth of 24.5% and gross value added (GVA) growth of 2.6% in comparison to 2021-22.
Number of factories:
The total number of factories increased from 2.49 lakh in 2021-22 to 2.53 lakh in 2022-23.
Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF):
GFCF,
a proxy for capital investment
, grew by over 77% to Rs 5.85 lakh crore in 2022-23 from Rs 3.3 lakh crore in 2021-22.
Number of employees in the formal sector:
Employees
include all workers and persons receiving wages and holding clerical or supervisory or managerial positions, etc.
include all persons employed directly or through any agency and includes both paid and unpaid workers engaged in any manufacturing process, etc.
The total number of employees in manufacturing industries
increased by 7.5% to 1.84 crore
in 2022-23 from 1.72 crore in 2021-22.
This is the
highest rate of increase in employment
in manufacturing industries in the last 12 years.
The highest employment was recorded in
factories producing food products
, followed by textiles, basic metals, wearing apparel and motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers.
The average emoluments:
These also improved in 2022-23, with average emoluments per person rising by 6.3% in 2022-23 as against the previous year.
Performance of the states:
In terms of GVA,
ranked first in 2022-23 followed by Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and UP.
These top five states together contributed over 54%
of the total manufacturing GVA of the country in 2022-23.
In terms of employment
, the top five states were
, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP and Karnataka in ASI 2022-23, contributing
about 55% of total manufacturing employment in 2022-23.
Key takeaways:
The ASI suggests that the impact of the Covid pandemic has been “wiped out”.
For example
, the estimated number of persons engaged in the manufacturing industries in 2022-23 is higher than the pre-pandemic level of 2018-19 by over 22.14 lakh.

**********Tea tribes marginalized in Assam despite their contribution to the economy
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to STs
Why in the News?
Recently, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren urged Assam’s Himanta Biswa Sarma to grant ST status to tea tribes, he was also strategically countering the BJP’s campaign in election-bound Jharkhand.
Demand for Scheduled Tribe Status
Recognition of Marginalization:
The Jharkhand CM has emphasized that the tea tribes in Assam, numbering around 70 lakh, are marginalized despite their significant contributions to the state’s economy.
He has formally requested
Scheduled Tribe (ST)
status for these communities, which are currently classified as
Other Backward Classes (OBCs)
in Assam, limiting their access to essential government benefits and protections associated with ST status.
ST Status:
The tea tribes meet the criteria for ST status due to their distinct cultural identity, traditional way of life, and vulnerability to exploitation.
Many members of these tribes are indigenous to Jharkhand and have historical ties to Assam, having migrated there during colonial rule to work in tea plantations.
Which are the Tea Tribes in Assam?
Munda:
Originating from the Chotanagpur plateau, they are one of the most prominent groups among the tea tribes in Assam.
Santhal:
They have a rich cultural heritage and are known for their traditional music and dance.
Oraon:
This group also hails from central India and has a strong presence in Assam’s tea gardens.
Gond:
Primarily found in central India, Gonds are part of the tea tribes due to historical migration patterns.
Kurukh:
This group is related to the Oraon and shares linguistic and cultural ties with them.
Bhumij
: They were brought to Assam for labor in tea plantations.
The criteria for a community to be recognized as a Scheduled Tribe (ST) in India:
As established by the
Lokur Committee
and currently followed by the Office of the
Registrar General of India (RGI),
include:
Primitive Traits:
Indications of a primitive lifestyle or cultural practices that are less developed compared to mainstream society.
Distinctive Culture
: A unique cultural identity that differentiates the community from others, including language, traditions, and customs.
Geographical Isolation:
Communities that are historically or currently isolated from the mainstream population, often residing in remote areas.
Shyness of Contact with the Community at Large
: A tendency to avoid interaction with broader society, which may stem from historical marginalization.
Backwardness:
Socio-economic disadvantages compared to the general population, including lower levels of education and economic development.
How do the Tea Tribes contribute to the Economy?
Major Workforce
: The tea tribes form the backbone of Assam’s tea industry, which is one of the largest in the world.
Approximately
53% of India’s total tea production
comes from Assam, and a significant portion of this labor force comprises tea tribe members, particularly women.
Economic Dependence
: It is estimated that around
20 lakh people (2 million) in Assam
are directly or indirectly dependent on the tea industry for their livelihoods.
The wages earned by tea tribe workers are a
primary source of income
for many families within these communities.
Cultural Heritage and Historical Injustices
Due to Cultural Displacement:
The tea tribes face challenges in preserving their cultural heritage due to their classification
as OBCs.
This status affects their
land rights
and access to employment opportunitie
leading to a
loss of cultural identity
Due to Socio-economic Challenges:
Despite contributing significantly to Assam’s tea industry, the tea tribes suffer from
poor living conditions, lack of educational facilities
inadequate healthcare.
They often live in poverty and
face systemic barriers
that prevent them from accessing government programs designed for marginalized communities. This situation reflects historical
injustices stemming
from colonial labor practices that uprooted them from their ancestral lands.
Way forward:
Granting ST Status
: Expedite the process of granting Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to the tea tribes, which would provide them with legal recognition and access to special protections, reservations, and welfare schemes aimed at uplifting marginalized communities.
Improving Living Conditions
: Implement targeted government programs to improve the living conditions of tea tribe communities, focusing on access to education, healthcare, and better infrastructure in tea plantation areas.
**********The La Nina and North India’s pollution
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Climate change; Pollution; Impact of La-Nina;
Why in the News?
The delayed onset of La Niña and the late retreat of the monsoon have diminished hopes that Delhi’s residents might enjoy improved air quality this winter compared to previous years.
What is Triple-dip
La- Nina?
Triple-dip La Niña refers to the rare occurrence of La Niña persisting for three consecutive years, causing prolonged cooler ocean temperatures in the Pacific and influencing global weather patterns, including stronger monsoons.
How has the triple-dip La Niña phenomenon influenced air quality in North India?
No dispersion of pollutants:
The delayed onset of La Niña has led to stagnant air and calm winds, preventing the dispersion of pollutants. In previous winters, La Niña helped improve air quality with stronger winds and atmospheric circulation.
Trapped air pollutants:
The slower monsoon retreat resulted in extended periods of high humidity, reduced atmospheric mixing, and trapped pollutants near the surface, contributing to deteriorated air quality.
What meteorological factors contributed to the observed anomalies in air quality?
Monsoon Retreat and Humidity:
The delayed retreat of the monsoon contributes to prolonged periods of high humidity and calm winds. These conditions
reduce atmospheric mixing
, trapping pollutants near the surface and leading to elevated levels of PM2.5 and PM10.
Stagnant Winds:
The absence of La Niña conditions results in stagnant surface winds, which hinder the
. This stagnation is particularly problematic given the regional emissions from stubble burning and other sources.
Stubble Burning:
With prevailing north-north-westerly winds, stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana could significantly worsen Delhi’s air quality if it occurs at even half the intensity seen in previous years.
What implications does this have for future climate and air quality management strategies?
Need for Broader Focus:
There is a growing recognition that air quality management must shift from a
localized emission-centric approach
to one that considers larger
meteorological patterns
and regional airsheds.
Policy Recommendations:
Policymakers should prioritize mitigating
PM2.5 emissions over PM10
, as PM2.5 poses greater health risks.
Integration of Climate Factors:
Future air quality strategies should integrate climate change considerations, recognizing that local emissions are only part of the equation.
Way forward:
Adopt Regional Airshed Management:
Shift from a localized approach to a broader airshed strategy, accounting for meteorological patterns and regional pollution sources to improve air quality management.
Prioritize PM2.5 Mitigation and Climate Integration:
Focus on reducing PM2.5 emissions, which pose higher health risks, and incorporate climate change factors into long-term air quality policies for comprehensive solutions.
**********New science awards, old political project

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Initiative related to scientific research;
Why in the News?
In 2023, the government replaced numerous opaque science awards with the Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP), a streamlined set with clear criteria. It aimed to address concerns about transparency by involving committees led by respected scientists.
Introduction of Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP):
replaced multiple science-related awards
with the RVP, a consolidated and streamlined set of awards.
RVP introduced
specific categories
clear eligibility criteria
to enhance transparency and reduce opacity in the selection process.
Committees led by reputed scientists were tasked with finalizing the awardees, a measure intended to
address concerns about bureaucratic interference.
Concerns Over Selection Process:
Chance of political interference:
The modification of rules overnight and the omission of some scientists from the final list, despite being shortlisted by the RVP committee, created suspicion of political interference.
Omission of the critic of Govt policy:
Notably, some of the omitted scientists had previously criticized government policies, leading to concerns that the awards process might be used to marginalize dissenting voices within the scientific community.
Shift in Authority:
Original Process:
Initially, the
head had the authority to finalize the awardees.
Recent Change:
A last-minute rule modification allowed the committee head to only “recommend” the final list to the Science Ministry, increasing the possibility of government intervention in the selection process.
Recognition Framework:
The RVP awards are categorized into four main types:
Vigyan Ratna
for lifetime achievements,
Vigyan Shri
for distinguished contributions,
Vigyan Yuva
for young scientists,
Vigyan Team
for collaborative efforts.
Impact on the Scientific Community
Concerns Over Transparency:
The modification of selection criteria just before the announcement of awardees has led to suspicions that political motives might influence who receives recognition.
Notably, some scientists who were initially included in the recommended list were omitted from the final public announcement, prompting questions about whether political pressures were involved.
Exclusion of Dissenting Voices:
Many excluded scientists had previously expressed dissent against government policies. This trend suggests a troubling pattern where recognition is contingent upon alignment with governmental perspectives, potentially
stifling academic freedom
and critical discourse within the scientific community.
Way forward:
Strengthen Transparency and Autonomy
: Establish an independent, non-governmental oversight body to ensure that the selection process remains transparent and free from political interference.
Safeguard Academic Freedom
: Implement safeguards to prevent exclusion based on political or ideological views, ensuring that recognition is purely merit-based.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
An annular solar eclipse will be visible in parts of South America on October 2, 2023.  It, however, will not be visible from India.
What is a Solar Eclipse?
occurs when the
Moon
moves between the
Earth
and the
Sun
, blocking the Sun’s light either fully or partially, casting a shadow on certain parts of the Earth.
There are
four types of solar eclipses
Total Solar Eclipse
: When the Moon completely blocks the Sun, turning the sky dark. People in the path of a total solar eclipse can witness the
Sun’s corona
(its outer atmosphere), which is normally hidden by the bright sunlight.
: Occurs when the Moon is at or near its
farthest point from Earth
. The Moon does not fully cover the Sun, leaving a visible
ring of fire
around the Moon. This is what people in parts of South America will witness on
Partial Solar Eclipse
: Happens when the Moon blocks only a part of the Sun, giving it a
crescent shape
. During both partial and annular eclipses, areas outside the Moon’s
umbra
(the darkest part of its shadow) experience a partial eclipse. It is the most common type of solar eclipse.
Hybrid Solar Eclipse
: The
rarest
type, where the eclipse shifts between
as the Moon’s shadow moves across the Earth. Some places see a total solar eclipse, while others see an annular one.
Frequency of Solar Eclipses
A solar eclipse can only occur during the
new moon
, when the

happens approximately every
29.5 days
because that is the time it takes for the Moon to orbit the Earth.
However,

two to five times annually
, but not every new moon results in an eclipse.
Why don’t they occur every month:
Moon’s orbit
around the Earth is tilted by about
5 degrees
compared to the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.
This means the Moon’s
shadow usually misses
A solar eclipse only
