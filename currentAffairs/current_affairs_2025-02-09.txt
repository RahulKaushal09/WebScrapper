**********Chandrayaan-3’s landing region is about 3.7 bn years old
Why in news?
A study by scientists of ISRO has estimated the age of the
landing site on the Moon to be 3.7 billion years.
This period aligns with the time when primitive microbial life first appeared on Earth.
What’s in today’s article?
Regional Geography of the Chandrayaan-3 Landing Site
ISRO Scientists Uncover Age and Evolution of Chandrayaan-3 Landing Site
Significance of the study: Understanding the Moon’s Violent History
In August 2023, India became the first country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon’s south pole.
The landing site is now known as
Shiv Shakti Point
. This Point is enclosed by multiple large craters:
Manzinus Crater
(96 km diameter, ~3.9 billion years old) to the north
Boguslawsky Crater
(95 km diameter, ~4 billion years old) to the southeast
Schomberger Crater
(86 km diameter, ~3.7 billion years old) to the south
Manzinus and Boguslawsky have flat floors and subdued walls, while Schomberger stands out due to its steep crater walls, central peak, raised rim, and well-preserved ejecta blanket.
The landing site, now known as
, has been under detailed study by ISRO’s Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) scientists using data from the Pragyan rover and Vikram lander.
This mapping effort provides
vital geological context
for lunar exploration and deepens our knowledge of the Moon’s
evolution and impact history
The findings have been published in the journal
Advances in Space Research
Study technique - Advanced Imaging and Terrain Analysis
PRL scientists used high-end imaging techniques, including the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s wide-angle and terrain cameras, to analyze craters and rock distributions near the landing site.
The Pragyan rover identified multiple rock fragments (over 1 cm in size) and secondary crater chains, helping researchers trace the origins of lunar materials in the area.
Identifying the Source of Lunar Rocks
The PRL team analyzed rock distributions around the landing area and the region navigated by Pragyan rover. They found that:
A higher rock concentration exists near a fresh crater (14 km south of the landing site), identified by continuous ejecta and a sharp rim.
This fresh crater material showed less space weathering compared to its surroundings.
Key highlights of the study
Estimating the Age of the Region
By studying 25 craters (500-1,150 meters in diameter) in the low-relief smooth plains, scientists estimated the
site's age to be 3.7 billion years (Ga)
Lunar Surface Evolution
The region has undergone continuous micro-meteorite bombardments and extreme thermal fluctuations, leading to the gradual breakdown of exposed rocks into lunar regolith over millions of years.
Formation of the Local Terrain
Based on morphological studies, scientists concluded that the landing site’s terrain primarily consists of ejecta from
two secondary craters
—Manzinus and Boguslawsky—shaping the region over time.
Unlike Earth, the Moon lacks an atmosphere, making it vulnerable to constant asteroid impacts.
Just counting the impact craters on the Moon helps determine the age of the landscape.
Chandrayaan 3 landed in a heavily cratered region. The geological map allows scientists with the context necessary to interpret the data captured by the mission.
It improves the scientific understanding of the geological history of the highlands around the south pole of the Moon.

**********The Freebies Debate in India: Welfare or Political Strategy?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context)
About Freebies (Freebies vs Welfare, Judicial Interventions, Political Significance, Way Forward, etc.)
Introduction:
The debate on
freebies vs. welfare schemes
in India has intensified in recent years, especially after
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement in July, 2022
, calling the
"revadi" culture
(a reference to political freebies)
dangerous for the country's development
The issue has since been taken up by the
Supreme Court
, which is examining whether promising and distributing freebies ahead of elections influences voters unfairly.
At the heart of this debate is the question:
What differentiates essential welfare policies from election-driven freebies?
While welfare measures have played a crucial role in India's development, there is concern that excessive political giveaways could strain state finances and undermine economic growth.
Understanding the Freebies vs. Welfare Debate:
The Role of the Welfare State
Welfarism has existed in
India’s governance structure since independence
, evolving through various phases.
Five-Year Plans
initiated under
Jawaharlal Nehru
focused on industrial growth and economic development.
However, recognizing the need for direct social welfare, the
mid-day meal scheme, Public Distribution System (PDS), and employment guarantee schemes
were later introduced to support the poor.
Directive Principles of State Policy
in the Indian Constitution also recognize the
state’s responsibility
to provide basic needs such as
education, healthcare, employment, and food security
. Over time, states have played a key role in expanding these social security measures.
Welfare Measures vs. Freebies:
lack of a clear definition of freebies
has fuelled the controversy.
While some argue that providing free electricity, water, or cash transfers is an economic burden, others claim that
these initiatives empower marginalized communities
Welfare measures such as
subsidized food, healthcare, and education
are recognized as
essential for human development
Freebies like
laptops, TVs, gold coins, and cash handouts
often serve
political objectives rather than economic needs
Some items, like
bicycles for girls to improve education access
, blur the line between essential welfare and election-oriented giveaways.
Judicial and Regulatory Interventions:
Supreme Court’s Stand on Freebies
Supreme Court has historically struggled
to distinguish between
welfare policies and political inducements
Subramaniam Balaji v. State of Tamil Nadu (2013)
, the Court ruled that while freebies influence voters, they
do not constitute bribery or corruption
However, in
, the Supreme Court referred a petition challenging
the constitutional validity of freebies
to a
three-judge bench
, arguing that they may
disrupt free and fair elections
Election Commission’s Guidelines
Election Commission of India (ECI)
initially remained silent on the issue but later
introduced a pro-forma in October 2022
, requiring political parties to explain the financial feasibility of their
poll promises
This move sparked criticism from opposition parties, who viewed it as an
interference in democratic rights
The Political Landscape: Freebies in Elections:
Delhi Assembly elections
showcased how all major political parties competed through
subsidy and freebie promises
AAP pledged
₹2,100 per month for women and
₹500 LPG cylinders
for low-income families.
BJP countered with
₹2,500 monthly aid for women and a
solar-powered free electricity plan
Congress joined in with its own welfare promises
, making it clear that
electoral freebies are a cross-party phenomenon
Popularity of Freebies in Elections
Immediate Appeal to Voters
– Unlike long-term policies, freebies provide
direct and tangible benefits
Clientelism in Politics
– Welfare benefits are often distributed
strategically to influence key voter segments
Lack of Structural Development
– In the absence of
strong employment generation and skill-building programs
, cash transfers and subsidies act as
short-term relief measures
Economic Concerns: The Fiscal Impact of Freebies
Rising State Debts and Fiscal Risks
RBI report on State Finances (2022)
raised concerns that:
Subsidy expenditure has sharply increased
, leading to financial instability.
Many states are
running large fiscal deficits
, which could impact their ability to fund long-term infrastructure projects.
Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Burden
Delhi’s revenue surplus fell from ₹14,457 crore in 2022-23 to a projected ₹3,231 crore in 2024-25
due to increased freebie expenses.
Annual revenue expenditure is expected to rise by ₹10,000-12,000 crore
in states where freebies dominate election promises.
Potential consequences include higher taxation and reduced investment in productive sectors
Economists warn that unless subsidies and giveaways are
carefully rationalized
, they could
slow down economic growth and reduce capital for essential public services
The Way Forward: Balancing Welfare and Fiscal Responsibility
Institutional Reforms and Regulatory Measures
parliament must lead the discussion
on defining and regulating
freebies vs. essential welfare
Stronger
financial oversight
is needed to
monitor both central and state-level subsidies
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003
, which limits deficit spending, should be
enforced more strictly
More Targeted Welfare Programs
Welfare schemes should be
needs-based and designed for long-term economic impact
Instead of
universal free handouts
, policies should focus on
specific disadvantaged groups
Digital governance tools like
Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT)
can reduce leakages and ensure funds
reach the intended beneficiaries
Enhancing Economic Growth Instead of Short-Term Sops
Employment generation programs
skill development
initiatives should replace
pure cash subsidies
Infrastructure investments in
education, healthcare, and agriculture
uplift communities sustainably

**********Implications of BJP's Electoral Victory in Delhi - Constitutional and Governance Aspects
Why in News?
The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) victory in the Delhi elections brings a new phase in the governance of the national capital.
The political shift is expected to ease the long-standing conflicts
between the (AAP-led) Delhi government and the Centre over Delhi's unique constitutional status.
Delhi’s Constitutional Status and the Centre-State Conflict:
Article 239AA of the Constitution of India:
It is about the
special provisions
for the
National Capital Territory of Delhi
. It was added by the Constitution (
69th Amendment
) Act of 1991.
limits
the control of the elected government over
services, land, police, and public order
While the pre-eminence of the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) is accepted in matters related to land, police, and public order,
the issue of control over administrative services
has been a major point of contention between the Centre and the Delhi government.
Supreme Court’s Interventions:
The Supreme Court, in 2017 and 2023,
ruled in favor of the Delhi government
, affirming its legislative and executive powers over administrative services.
However, in May 2023, the Centre
amended
the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi
(GNCTD) Act
of 1991,
extending the L-G’s powers over bureaucratic appointments and transfers.
The amendment led to the formation of
a bureaucratic appointments body
, where the Chief Minister could be effectively overruled by senior bureaucrats.
Impact of BJP’s Victory:
The BJP’s electoral win paves the way for
a “double-engine” government
, where the ruling party in the state aligns with the NDA-led Centre.
A BJP-led state government is less likely to challenge the Centre’s policies,
ensuring smoother governance.
The Union Home Ministry’s role remains crucial, as it controls the Delhi Police.
Synergy between the L-G and the Chief Minister may facilitate
quicker approvals of projects, land allocations, and funding decisions.
Key Policy Implications:
Past conflicts
, such as the Delhi Jal Board’s funding issue (Rs 3,000 crore) and the controversy over sending government school teachers abroad for training,
might now be resolved more efficiently.
The BJP-led government could
potentially streamline governance and improve coordination
in Delhi’s administration.
Challenges to Federalism:
The Supreme Court’s past rulings emphasized that Delhi’s governance must align with the
basic structure of federalism.
The BJP’s rule will test the spirit of the SC’s 2017 judgment
, which warned against reducing governance to mere “semantics” over constitutional grammar.
Whether the Centre respects the “
popular will
” remains to be seen in the coming years.
Conclusion:
With the BJP now in power, governance in Delhi is expected to be smoother, especially in coordination with the Centre.
However, this shift also raises concerns about federalism, executive control, and the balance of power between the Centre and the state.
The coming years will be
a litmus test
for the Supreme Court’s rulings on Delhi’s governance structure.

**********Is Private Investment Set to Increase?
Why in news?
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman expressed optimism about a revival in private investments following income tax breaks and the RBI’s first interest rate cut in nearly five years.
The government’s income tax relief and the RBI’s repo rate cut are expected to boost consumption, leading businesses to review their capacity utilization.
Citing anecdotal evidence, she noted signs of increasing investment activity and reported that Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) orders for April to June were already being booked, indicating a potential recovery in consumption.
What’s in today’s article?
Concern Over Declining Private Investment
Factors determining private investment
Reasons behind sluggish private investment
Private investment in India has been declining for over a decade and weakened further in the December 2024-2025 quarter, dropping by 1.4%.
However, overall investments grew by 9.9%, driven by a sharp rise in public investments—11.8% by the Centre and 34.6% by State governments.
Despite concerns over efficiency, public investment has played a significant role in driving India’s high growth in recent years, compensating for weak private sector participation.
Importance of Private Investment
Private investment is crucial for building capital and boosting economic productivity.
It is generally considered more efficient than public investment because market forces ensure optimal capital allocation.
It is generally believed that money deposited as savings in banks by ordinary citizens is loaned out to fund large-scale investments.
But in reality, private investment depends not on savings levels in the economy but on the pace at which loans are created by the banking system.
This is because banks can create loans electronically through simple accounting entries that deposit money in borrowers’ accounts even without savings to back these loans.
So, private investment is closely linked to the pace of bank credit growth.
Higher credit growth enables more private sector investments
Between 2005 and 2014, when economic growth was strong, bank credit growth averaged 22%.
However, it dropped to around 9% between 2014 and 2021, coinciding with an economic slowdown.
Lack of Consumer Demand as a Factor
Economists argue that sluggish private investment is due to weak consumer demand.
They believe that unless consumers have more money to spend, businesses will hesitate to invest.
The recent move to make incomes up to ₹12 lakh tax-free aims to boost spending and, in turn, private investment.
The Inverse Relationship Between Investment and Consumption
Historically, private investment and consumer spending have shown an inverse relationship.
Private consumption was 90% of GDP in 1950-51 but gradually declined to 54.7% by 2010-11, while private investment rose from around 10% to 27% in 2007-08.
However, since 2011-12, consumer spending has increased while private investment has declined, suggesting a natural trade-off between the two.
Policy Uncertainty as the Key Issue
Rather than weak consumer demand, policy uncertainty and unfriendly government policies are seen as the primary reasons for sluggish private investment.
Analysts argue that the slowdown in economic reforms has discouraged long-term, capital-intensive private investments.
