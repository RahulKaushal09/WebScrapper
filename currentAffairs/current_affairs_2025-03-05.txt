**********First-ever comprehensive survey of India’s river dolphins
Why in news?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the results of India's first comprehensive population estimation of
riverine dolphins
.
Conducted between 2021 and 2023 across the Ganga and Brahmaputra basins, the survey estimated an average of 6,324 Gangetic dolphins. Only three Indus River dolphins were found in the Beas River, Punjab.
The study highlights threats to these endangered species, including pollution, habitat damage, prey decline, and climate change. Both species are accorded the highest protection under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
What’s in today’s article?
Key Findings of the Riverine Dolphin Survey (2021-2023)
Survey Methodology and Challenges
Dolphin ‘Hotspots’ and ‘Coldspots’
This first-of-its-kind survey provides crucial insights into the status of endangered riverine dolphins and highlights the need for conservation efforts.
Survey Overview
Conducted by the
Wildlife Institute of India
under the Union Environment Ministry.
Covered 28 rivers by boat and 30 rivers by road across the Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Beas River basins.
Surveyed 7,109 km of the Ganga and its tributaries, 1,297 km of the Brahmaputra system, and 101 km of the Beas River.
Dolphin Population Estimates
Total Gangetic dolphins: 6,324 (range: 5,977 to 6,688).
Ganga’s main stem: 3,275
Ganga’s tributaries: 2,414
Brahmaputra’s main stem: 584
Brahmaputra’s tributaries: 51
Indus River dolphins: Only 3, found in the Beas River, Punjab.
State-wise Distribution of Gangetic Dolphins
Uttar Pradesh – 2,397 (highest population).
Bihar – 2,220.
West Bengal – 815.
Jharkhand – 162.
Rajasthan & Madhya Pradesh – 95.
Punjab – 3.
Challenges in Dolphin Population Estimation
River dolphins live in
turbid, opaque waters
and surface only briefly, making population estimation difficult.
Dolphins surface for
only 1.26 seconds
and dive for
107 seconds
, leading to:
Observer error
– Some surfacing dolphins may be missed.
Availability error
– Some dolphins may not surface during the counting period.
Survey Techniques
Visual Surveys
Double Observer Method
(for deep and wide channels):
Two teams positioned on different decks scan both sides of the vessel.
The boat travels at
8-10 km/hour
to prevent double counting.
Tandem Method
(for channels <600m wide, <3m deep).
Single Boat Method
(for channels <300m wide, <2m deep).
Acoustic Surveys
Uses
underwater microphones (hydrophones)
to detect dolphin echolocation clicks.
Dolphins, being
functionally blind
, navigate using echolocation.
Multiple hydrophones help
triangulate dolphin locations
reduce observer error
This multi-method approach improves accuracy in estimating the endangered dolphin population.
Coldspots – Areas with Low or No Dolphin Presence
Ganga River:
Narora to Kanpur (366 km)
– Extremely low encounter rate (0.1 dolphins/km).
Farukkhabad-Kannauj
(between Narora and Kanpur barrages) – Another coldspot.
Other Coldspots:
Yamuna River (Kaushambi-Chitrakoot).
Sharda River (Pilibhit).
Rapti River (Balrampur-Siddharth Nagar).
Barak River (Assam).
Declining dolphin population in Subansiri and Kulsi rivers (Assam).
Hotspots – Areas with High Dolphin Population
Uttar Pradesh – Encounter rate of 0.62 dolphins/km.
Bihar – Highest encounter rate of 1.62 dolphins/km, attributed to deeper river channels and tributary confluences (Ghaghara, Gandak, Kosi, Son).
Densely Populated Stretches
Chausa-Manihar (590 km) – 2.20 dolphins/km.
Manihari (Bihar) to Rajmahal (Jharkhand) – 2.75 dolphins/km (highest density).
Assam – Despite deep water in the Brahmaputra, its tributaries had low average depth, affecting dolphin population.
The survey highlights the influence of river depth and habitat conditions on dolphin distribution, identifying key areas for conservation efforts.

**********RBI’s Proposal to Waive Foreclosure Charges for MSMEs
Why in news?
The RBI has issued a consultation paper proposing to waive foreclosure charges and prepayment penalties on loans taken by micro and small enterprises (MSEs). Currently, such charges are not applicable to individual borrowers with floating-rate term loans.
The proposal aims to extend this benefit to MSEs to ensure easier and more affordable financing.
What’s in today’s article?
Understanding Foreclosure Charges for MSMEs
Easing Loan Transfers for MSMEs with RBI’s Proposed Measures
Enhancing Financial Flexibility for MSEs
Impact on Banks and NBFCs
Challenges MSMEs Face in Availing Foreclosure Charge Waivers
Foreclosure charges are penalties imposed by banks when MSMEs repay their loans before the agreed-upon tenure.
These charges compensate lenders for the loss of interest income due to early repayment.
Types of Foreclosure Charges
Full Prepayment Charges – Applied when the entire loan is repaid before the maturity date.
Partial Prepayment Charges – Imposed when only a portion of the loan is paid off early.
The RBI has proposed new rules to make loan repayments easier for micro and small enterprises (MSEs).
Current Status
Currently, individuals with floating-rate loans don’t have to pay extra charges for early repayment, but this benefit is not available to businesses.
The RBI now wants to extend this rule to MSEs for business loans up to ₹7.5 crore.
However, small cooperative banks and NBFCs with assets under ₹1,000 crore are exempt.
Key Highlights of the Proposal
No foreclosure charges or prepayment penalties on floating-rate loans for MSEs.
Banks and NBFCs cannot set a minimum lock-in period before these benefits apply.
No hidden or retrospective charges—borrowers must know all fees upfront.
For loans with both fixed and floating rates, the benefit applies only when the loan is in floating-rate mode at the time of prepayment.
Bringing More Borrowers into the Formal System
Experts believe that waiving foreclosure charges will encourage more MSMEs to take formal loans.
It will also improve transparency by reducing hidden charges, helping businesses plan their cash flows better and incentivizing timely repayment.
Current Challenges for MSMEs in Switching Loans
Many MSME units seek to foreclose loans, mainly to switch banks due to difficulties in obtaining additional loans from the same bank.
However, some banks argue that foreclosure charges are factored into loan sanctions and should still apply to existing loans.
Foreclosure Charges and Processing Delays
Industry experts described switching loans as a “nightmare” due to high foreclosure charges and long delays in paperwork.
They suggest that the RBI should set a time limit for processing loan transfers to make the system more efficient for MSME borrowers.
Reducing Debt Burden for MSMEs
The RBI’s proposed waiver on foreclosure penalties allows small businesses to repay loans early without extra charges.
While banks use these penalties to compensate for lost interest, early exits help MSMEs ease their debt burden and improve financial flexibility.
Boosting Working Capital
The waiver would be extremely beneficial for MSMEs, especially for working capital loans, as many businesses prefer to repay before the due date to manage cash flow better.
Consumer Benefits Leading to Industry Growth
Removing foreclosure charges will ultimately benefit the financial sector.
Similar waiver for retail loans was well-received by consumers, and extending it to SME loans could have a positive impact.
Profitability Concerns for NBFCs and Banks
A report warns that the proposed measures could reduce profits for financial products like loans against property (LAP), SME loans, and business loans.
The increased ease of loan transfers may intensify competition, affecting the revenue of banks and NBFCs.
Increased Competition in the Loan Market
Although affordable housing finance companies (AHFCs) are not covered under the RBI’s circular, the report suggests that competitiveness in the non-housing loan (NHL) segment could rise over time.
Large NBFCs may adjust interest rates to compete more aggressively in the market.
Lack of Awareness
Many MSMEs are unaware of the RBI’s foreclosure charge waiver guidelines.
Documentation Issues
MSMEs may struggle to gather the necessary documents to prove eligibility for the waiver.
This could lead to delays or businesses completely overlooking the benefit.
Bureaucratic and Operational Hurdles
Complex procedures and bureaucratic red tape can make it difficult for MSMEs to avail the waiver.
This may lead to frustration and added financial strain for businesses.

**********Bollgard-3
Recently, there has been an increasing demand for Bollgard-3 in Punjab, ahead of the cotton sowing season.
About Bollgard-3:
It is a pest-resistant
genetically-modified (GM) cotton variety.
It was
developed by Monsanto
more than a decade ago, and shows remarkable resistance to pests.
It contains three
Bt proteins Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab and Vip3A
that cause insect death by disrupting their normal gut function. This in turn allows for the growth of a healthier cotton crop, and increases yield.
Farmers are demanding the introduction of Bollgard-3, which is particularly
effective against lepidopteran pests like pink bollworm.
Bollgard-1
was a Monsanto-developed Bt cotton introduced in India in 2002, followed by
Bollgard-2
in 2006. The latter remains prevalent today.
And although these do have some pest-repellent properties, they are not effective against the whitefly and the pink bollworm, which arrived in Punjab in 2015-16 and 2018-19 respectively.

**********IMF Report Warns of Systemic Risks in India's NBFC Sector
Why in the News?
The International Monetary Fund has recently published a report titled “India Financial System Stability Assessment”.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction
IMF’s Findings (NBFC Sector Risks, Recommendations, Impact on India’s Financial Ecosystem, etc.)
Introduction:
(IMF) has expressed concerns regarding the financial stability of India’s
Non-Banking Financial Companies
(NBFCs) due to their heavy exposure to the power and infrastructure sectors.
The warning comes amid the IMF’s "
" report, which highlights how the NBFC sector's interconnectedness with banks, mutual funds, and corporate bond markets could pose significant risks if distress emerges.
IMF’s Findings on NBFC Sector Risks:
The IMF report outlines key vulnerabilities within the NBFC sector:
High Exposure to Power Sector:
NBFCs, particularly infrastructure financing companies, have an excessive concentration of loans in the power sector, which has been historically plagued by structural inefficiencies.
The three largest infrastructure financing NBFCs accounted for
63% of power sector loans in FY 2024
, up from 55% in FY 2020.
Dependence on Market Instruments and Bank Borrowings:
56% of NBFC lending is financed through market instruments, making them susceptible to liquidity crises.
The reliance on bank borrowings has increased, raising systemic risk.
Limited Regulatory Support Compared to Banks:
Unlike banks, NBFCs
cannot accept demand deposits
and their funds are
not insured
They
lack direct access
to RBI’s liquidity facilities, making them more vulnerable to financial shocks.
Potential Systemic Risks:
The IMF report warns that NBFC distress could have cascading effects across the financial system due to their
deep interlinkages with banks, mutual funds, and corporate bond markets
Spillover Effect on Banks and Financial Markets:
Any financial distress in NBFCs could
amplify stress across the banking system
, leading to liquidity crises in mutual funds and bond markets.
Past crises, such as
IL&FS and DHFL collapses
, demonstrated how NBFC failures impact the broader economy.
Regulatory Gaps for State-Owned NBFCs:
State-owned NBFCs dominate the sector, with three government-backed Infrastructure Financing Companies (IFCs) holding
one-third of total NBFC assets
Unlike private NBFCs,
state-owned entities are not subjected to large exposure limits
, raising regulatory concerns.
IMF Recommendations:
Strengthening Liquidity Regulations:
NBFCs, particularly those with significant infrastructure exposure, should
comply with stricter liquidity norms
to avoid asset-liability mismatches.
Regulatory Parity Between State-Owned and Private NBFCs:
The IMF calls for
uniform regulations
for state-owned and private NBFCs to
create a level playing field
and enhance financial stability.
Enhanced Data Sharing and Risk Monitoring:
Regular monitoring of NBFCs’ lending patterns and improved risk management frameworks are needed to
prevent financial disruptions
Reducing Over-Reliance on Market Instruments:
NBFCs should
diversify funding sources
to reduce dependence on market instruments and bank borrowings.
Prioritizing Financial Stability Over Developmental Motives:
The IMF advises the Indian government to
balance financial stability with the developmental role
of banks and NBFCs.
Impact on India’s Financial Ecosystem:
Despite these concerns, the IMF acknowledged India’s progress in financial inclusion and digital infrastructure. Some key highlights include:
80% of adults in India have financial accounts
, driven by the expansion of banking networks and digital payment systems such as UPI.
The rise of
retail investors in equity markets
has made India one of the largest global markets for options trading.
However, the IMF stresses that
financial stability risks must be managed proactively
to sustain economic growth.
Conclusion:
The IMF’s cautionary report highlights
serious vulnerabilities
in India’s NBFC sector, particularly due to
high exposure to power and infrastructure
systemic interconnectedness with banks and financial markets
While India’s financial sector has made
significant strides in inclusion and market depth
regulatory reforms are crucial
to prevent financial disruptions and maintain long-term stability.

**********Designing India’s AI Safety Institute
Context
Artificial Intelligence
(AI) has become a critical driver of technological progress
, and India is positioning itself as a significant player in this domain.
The recent announcement by Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw regarding India’s plan to launch an
indigenous AI model and establish an AI Safety Institute (AISI) highlights the country’s commitment
to AI development and regulation.
This initiative, under the
Safe and Trusted Pillar of the IndiaAI Mission, aims to address both local challenges
and align with global AI safety frameworks.
As AI technology rapidly evolves,
India's AISI must navigate a complex landscape of risks, regulatory challenges, and international collaborations
while ensuring that AI remains inclusive and beneficial for its diverse population.
The Role of AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) in Global Governance and India’s Leadership in AI Governance for the Global South
Countries worldwide have recognised
the potential risks associated with AI and are establishing AISIs to mitigate them.
Rather than relying on static regulations that may become obsolete, these institutes
focus on continuous research, evaluation, and risk assessment.
Since 2023, the U.K., the U.S., Singapore, and Japan have launched their own AISIs,
contributing to a global network aimed at developing a common technical understanding of AI risks.
For instance,
the U.K.’s AISI has introduced ‘Inspect,’ an open-source platform
designed to evaluate AI models in areas such as reasoning, knowledge accuracy, and autonomous capabilities.
Similarly, the U.S. AISI has formed an inter-departmental task force
to address national security and public safety risks posed by AI.
Singapore’s AISI is concentrating on safe model design, content assurance,
and rigorous testing.
These global efforts
highlight the necessity of technical rigor, transparency, and international cooperation in AI safety governance.
India’s position as a leading technology hub in the Global South gives it
a unique opportunity to champion inclusive AI governance.
Many emerging economies
lack the resources and technical expertise to establish their own AISIs.
India can take the lead in creating a collective effort among developing nations
to co-develop AI safety frameworks and evaluation metrics tailored to local challenges.
ongoing collaboration with UNESCO on AI readiness has laid the groundwork
for ethical AI development and deployment.
Insights from this partnership can help India’s AISI
formulate comprehensive guidelines
that ensure AI systems are not only powerful but also ethical and safe.
Additionally,
initiatives under the IndiaAI Mission,
such as machine unlearning, synthetic data generation, AI bias mitigation, and privacy-enhancing technologies,
can serve as foundational components of a robust AI safety ecosystem.
By advancing these technologies,
India can contribute to global AI safety efforts while ensuring that AI systems developed within the country
align with ethical and responsible AI principles.
The Need for International Collaboration
Despite India’s focus on
indigenous AI development,
it cannot operate in isolation.
Effective AI governance requires
striking a balance
between local relevance and global alignment.
Given AI’s cross-border implications,
India must adopt international standards
while adapting them to its own context.
One of the key steps toward this goal is the
establishment of a global standardised AI safety taxonomy.
Currently, technical experts, policymakers, social scientists, and legal professionals use different terminologies
when discussing AI risks.
lack of uniformity creates communication barriers
that hinder comprehensive safety assessments.
A standardised taxonomy would enable multidisciplinary collaboration
and ensure that all stakeholders speak the same language when evaluating AI risks.
Another crucial measure is the creation of an international AI model notification framework.
Such a framework would encourage AISIs across the world to share information
on the purpose and potential risks of powerful AI models.
Increased transparency would facilitate coordinated governance
and help India prepare its digital infrastructure for the safe deployment of advanced AI systems.
India’s AI Safety Priorities: Addressing Local Challenges
While international collaboration is crucial,
India must also prioritise its unique AI challenges.
One of the most pressing concerns is AI inaccuracy
and its potential to reinforce discrimination in an Indian context.
Given India's linguistic diversity, socioeconomic disparities, and varying levels of digital literacy,
the risks of bias in AI systems are heightened.
To mitigate these risks,
the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has structured India’s AISI under a hub-and-spoke model
, developing partnerships with academic institutions, startups, industry players, and government departments.
This approach ensures that AI solutions are developed with an awareness
of India's diverse landscape.
Startups such as Karya are already addressing AI bias by
enabling rural communities to generate high-quality datasets in Indian languages.
Other initiatives focus on multilingual AI development, promoting inclusivity
and accessibility.
India’s AISI should leverage these efforts to create AI systems that are not only technically sound but also equitable and representative of India’s vast population.
Additionally, the IndiaAI Mission has launched Responsible AI projects targeting areas such as watermarking
, ethical AI frameworks, risk assessment, and deep-fake detection.
These efforts align with the Safe and Trusted AI pillar, ensuring that AI development in India is both innovative and responsible.
Conclusion
The establishment of an AISI
represents a significant step toward ensuring
AI development aligns with ethical standards
, technical excellence, and global safety frameworks.
While India must address local concerns
such as AI bias and inclusivity,
it cannot ignore the importance of global collaboration in AI governance.
By actively engaging with international AISIs, adopting standardized safety taxonomies, and leading AI governance efforts in the Global South,
India can position itself as a key player in shaping the future of responsible AI.

**********Remodelling the UAE-India Aviation Partnership
Context
As the world's third-largest domestic aviation market,
India's ambitions extend beyond national borders,
emphasising the need for international collaboration and regulatory advancements.
A key player in this trajectory is the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
India’s most significant outbound travel destination.
However,
existing limitations in bilateral air service agreements are restricting the full potential
of this partnership.
Addressing these challenges through modernised policies
and strategic cooperation can not only enhance connectivity but also drive economic growth and investment between both nations.
The Growing Demand for Air Travel, Government Initiatives and India-UAE Corridor
India’s aviation industry has witnessed an unprecedented rise
in air travel demand over the past decade, fuelled by economic growth, rising incomes, government initiatives, and an increasing preference for air travel over other modes of transportation.
With India now ranked as the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market in terms of passenger numbers,
the need for expanded infrastructure, regulatory reforms, and international partnerships
has never been more critical.
construction of major airports
, such as the Navi Mumbai International Airport,
underscores the country’s ambitions
to become a leading global aviation hub.
despite this rapid progress, existing constraints, such as limited bilateral agreements,
infrastructure bottlenecks, and supply-demand mismatches, continue to challenge the sector’s full potential.
Government Initiatives and Expanding Infrastructure
To support the growing demand for air travel,
the Indian government has launched several initiatives
aimed at improving connectivity, affordability, and accessibility.
One of the most significant programs is
Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN),
which focuses on enhancing regional connectivity by making air travel more affordable for smaller cities and towns.
The UDAN scheme has resulted in the establishment of new routes and airports
, allowing Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities to access domestic and international markets.
This
initiative is crucial in meeting the travel aspirations of India’s expanding middle class
, who now see air travel as a viable and convenient option.
In addition to government efforts,
private investments in airport infrastructure have also played a vital role in modernising and expanding aviation facilities.
The Navi Mumbai International Airport
, which is expected to be one of the largest and most advanced airports in India,
will serve as a crucial alternative to the heavily congested Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) in Mumbai.
Rising Middle-Class Aspirations and Business Travel
One of the most significant drivers of increased air travel demand in India is the
rapid rise of the middle class.
As disposable incomes grow and consumer preferences shift toward convenience and time efficiency
, more people are choosing air travel over traditional rail or road transport.
According to industry estimates,
every 1% increase in Indian passport holders translates to an additional 10 million potential international travellers.
trend is evident in the surge of outbound tourism,
business travel, and leisure trips among Indian citizens.
Additionally,
India’s integration into the global economy has led to an increase in business-related air travel.
International Connectivity and the India-UAE Air Corridor
India-UAE air corridor is one of the busiest in the world,
with over 1,100 flights per week connecting the two countries.
Despite this high volume of air traffic,
the demand for flights continues to exceed supply,
resulting in rising ticket prices, limited route options, and restricted access to key growth centres.
Under the current bilateral air service agreement, UAE carriers are only permitted to operate flights to 15 Indian cities
, leaving many important business and tourism hubs, such as Surat, Visakhapatnam, Indore, Tiruchirappalli, and Patna, without direct international connectivity.
Similarly,
Indian carriers face restrictions on increasing their frequencies to major UAE destinations, such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
Challenges in Meeting Future Demand
Airport Congestion and Infrastructure Bottlenecks
Major airports such as Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru are already operating at or near full capacity, leading to
delays, inefficiencies, and passenger inconvenience.
The development of 2nd airports (such as Navi Mumbai and Jewar) is a step in the right direction
, but further investment is needed in air traffic management, runway expansion, and terminal infrastructure.
Regulatory Barriers and Bilateral Agreements
restrictive nature of bilateral air service agreements, particularly with high-demand countries like the UAE
, limits the ability of airlines to expand routes and increase flight frequencies.
A more open aviation policy that allows greater flexibility in route selection
and airline partnerships could help bridge the supply-demand gap.
High Airfare and Limited Affordability
With constrained supply and high demand,
ticket prices often become prohibitively expensive,
restricting travel for a significant portion of the population.
Policies that encourage airline competition and improve market access
could help drive down fares and make air travel more accessible.
Workforce and Skill Development
growing aviation industry requires more trained pilots, engineers,
and ground staff to meet increasing demand.
Partnerships with countries like the UAE,
which have advanced aviation training programs, could help India build a skilled workforce.
The Way Forward: Collaboration Over Competition, A Unified Aviation Ecosystem
Instead of viewing each other as competitors,
India and the UAE have the opportunity to build a synergistic aviation ecosystem.
By creating cooperation in areas such as airline partnerships, training programs, and technological advancements,
both nations can unlock new opportunities for economic and social development.
The UAE, with its established aviation hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, can serve as a model for Indian cities
aiming to enhance global connectivity.
Furthermore, expanding air access to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities in India would facilitate regional economic growth
, allowing smaller cities to participate in international trade and tourism.
A well-integrated aviation network would not only benefit major metropolitan areas but also create a more inclusive economic landscape
, strengthening India’s position as a global aviation hub.
Conclusion
While infrastructural developments like Navi Mumbai International Airport demonstrate India’s commitment to expanding its aviation sector,
regulatory barriers continue to limit its full potential.
A modernised, open-skies policy would allow both nations to capitalise on growing travel demand
, reduce costs, and enhance connectivity.
By prioritising cooperation over competition,
India and the UAE can create a mutually beneficial aviation ecosystem that supports economic expansion, enhances global trade, and develop deeper cultural and social exchanges.

**********Delimitation in India - Balancing Democracy and Demography
Context:
India is on the brink of a "Second Republic," with the
upcoming delimitation exercise reigniting debates on demographic imbalances and political representation
.
The process of delimitation, meant to ensure fair representation, struggles to reconcile territorial, demographic, ethnic, and political considerations.
Understanding Delimitation in India:
Delimitation adjusts constituency boundaries
based on population changes to ensure proportional representation in Parliament.
The process has been frozen since 1976
to avoid penalizing states that successfully controlled population growth, mainly in the South.
As a result, states like
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
remain underrepresented compared to Tamil Nadu and Kerala, despite their larger populations.
This disparity, known as
malapportionment
, is expected to
shift political power toward North India post-2029
Constitutional and Legal Framework:
Article 82
of the Indian Constitution mandates periodic delimitation.
The Delimitation Commission
- an independent body, implements the process.
Delimitation exercises were conducted in
1952, 1962, and 1972
but were halted by the
42nd Constitutional Amendment (1976)
and extended in 2001 until 2026.
Meghraj Kothari v Delimitation Commission (1966)
upheld the finality of delimitation orders, restricting judicial intervention.
Recently, the Court dismissed a petition challenging the Jammu & Kashmir delimitation, despite claims that it marginalised minority communities.
Concerns and Impact:
Concerns:
Southern states vs northern states:
states surpass the North in
per capita income
, infrastructure, healthcare, and education but risk losing political representation due to
slower population growth
Southern states contribute more to the central treasury but may
end up subsidizing northern states
with larger populations but lower economic output.
The Red Queen Effect:
If population growth in the north is unchecked or southern economic growth stagnates, political disparities will widen.
Risk of gerrymandering:
Delimitation could lead to electoral manipulation favoring certain political parties or social groups and establishing permanent political or electoral majorities.
Impact on representation:
While delimitation raises above concerns, it brings promises to devolve power to:
Scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs):
According to
Article 330(2)
of the Constitution, reserved seats for SCs and STs should be proportional to their population in each state.
Currently their representation is based on the 2001 Census, ignoring recent demographic changes.
For example
, Bihar’s 2023 caste-based survey showed an increase in SC/ST population.
Women:
For example, the Women’s Reservation Act (2023) mandates 33% women reservation in Lok Sabha and state legislatures.
However, it will take effect only after delimitation, delaying gender parity in Parliament until 2029.
International Comparisons:
New Zealand and South Africa
have constitutional provisions for delimitation.
India and Japan
handle the process through ordinary legislation. Courts in India have largely upheld delimitation decisions,
limiting judicial review
Proposed Solutions:
Expanding the Lok Sabha
(Alistair McMillan) to accommodate demographic shifts without reducing seats for any state.
Strengthening the Rajya Sabha
(Milan Vaishnav) to counterbalance North Indian dominance in the Lok Sabha.
Decentralization of power
to enhance democratic participation at subnational levels.
Broad political consensus
among national and regional parties to ensure a fair and transparent delimitation process.
The unprecedented political consensus surrounding the Constitution 127th Amendment Bill suggests that India is rapidly evolving into
a consociational or power-sharing democracy
within a majoritarian polity.
The Bill amends the Constitution to allow states and union territories to prepare their own list of socially and educationally backward classes.
These approaches align with
Alexis de Tocqueville’s
vision of the gradual development of “
equality of conditions
” in India.
Conclusion:
Delimitation has the potential to
enhance the quality of India’s electoral democracy
rejuvenate its democratic longevity
in the long term.
Without careful navigation
of demographic and political complexities,
it could deepen regional disparities.
A balanced approach
ensuring fair representation, gender inclusivity, and decentralization can strengthen India’s democracy in the long run.

(UPSC CSE 2019)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on the
Long-term Capital Gains Tax
(2018)
(2019).
In February 2025, the Union Finance Minister introduced the Income-Tax Bill, 2025, to replace the Income-Tax Act, 1961. The government claims it will simplify tax laws and reduce disputes. However, despite some structural changes, many complexities remain, and the Bill grants even more authoritarian powers than the current law.
Today’s editorial discusses the newly introduced Income-Tax Bill, 2025, which is important for the GS III Mains paper.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Recently, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the Income Tax Bill, 2025, in the Lok Sabha, while opposition parties protested against it.
What are the key objectives of the Income-Tax Bill, 2025?
Simplifying Tax Laws:
To make the tax code easier to understand for both taxpayers and professionals. Example: Replacing complex legal phrases like
“notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary”
with simpler terms like
“irrespective of anything to the contrary”
Reducing Litigation and Ambiguity:
To minimize legal disputes by providing clearer definitions and reducing interpretative confusion. Example: Consolidating compliance timelines into tables and schedules to avoid multiple interpretations of deadlines.
Modernizing Tax Compliance:
To align tax administration with technological advancements and changing business environments. Example: Allowing the use of a “risk management strategy” to identify tax evasion through data analysis.
Ensuring Policy Continuity with Structural Reform:
To retain core tax policies while improving the law’s structure for better efficiency. Example: Definitions like
“income”
still refer to the 1961 Act but are presented in a more structured format.
Expanding Digital Oversight:
To empower tax authorities to investigate digital transactions and virtual assets. Example: Permitting access to digital platforms (e.g., email servers and social media) during tax investigations.
Why did the government previously amend the criteria for a reassessment of tax?
The government previously amended the criteria for
through the
Finance Act, 2021
, which came into effect on
April 1, 2021
. This marked a significant shift in the reassessment framework under the
Income Tax Act, 1961
Shift from “Reason to Believe” to “Information”:
The previous requirement for reassessment was based on the assessing officer having a
“reason to believe”
that income had escaped assessment.
After 2021, tax authorities could reopen assessments if they had
“information”
suggesting unreported income, including data from third-party reports.
Introduction of Risk Management Strategy:
The amendment introduced the use of a
as a basis for reopening tax assessments.
Tax authorities can now reopen cases based on algorithm-driven data analysis without needing detailed justification.
Time Limit Reduction for Reopening Assessments:
The time limit for reassessment was reduced from 6 years to 3 years for most cases, with a 10-year limit for cases involving income above ₹50 lakh.
If concealed income exceeds ₹50 lakh, tax authorities can reopen cases up to 10 years later, enhancing scrutiny in high-value matters.
Legal Challenges and Judicial Interpretations:
The vague definition of
and the undefined
led to concerns over arbitrary use of power.
Courts have intervened to limit reassessment powers, demanding stricter adherence to procedural safeguards to protect taxpayer rights.
What are the main concerns regarding their implementation?
Increased Administrative Burden:
The new system requires
detailed procedures
prior approvals
, leading to delays and increased workload for tax authorities. Example: Obtaining
approval from senior officers
before issuing notices can slow down reassessment, especially in cases involving large volumes of data.
Ambiguity in “Information” Definition:
The term
used to trigger reassessment is
broad and vague
, allowing
subjective interpretations
. Example: Data from
social media activity
can be used for reopening cases, raising concerns about the
reliability and accuracy
of such information.
Risk of Harassment and Overreach:
Despite safeguards, there is concern that
may still face
unwarranted scrutiny
under the new rules. Example: Cases where
can be reopened for
, leading to prolonged uncertainty for taxpayers.
Challenges in Data Privacy and Security: Accessing digital platforms
and using
technology-based triggers
raises
privacy concerns
for individuals and businesses. Example: Tax authorities can now access
electronic records
financial platforms
, increasing the risk of
data misuse
Legal Uncertainty and Litigation:
Despite reforms, there is still a risk of
judicial challenges
due to the
interpretive flexibility
in the law. Example: Taxpayers may challenge
reassessment notices
on the grounds of
insufficient evidence
procedural lapses
, leading to further litigation.
Way forward:
Enhancing Clarity and Transparency:
Clearly define terms like

and ensure
uniform application
. Example: Establish
detailed guidelines
on acceptable data sources and the procedure for using
digital evidence
Strengthening Safeguards and Oversight:
Implement

**********Remodelling the UAE-India aviation partnership
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Role of UAE;
Why in the News?
The UAE’s potential role in supporting India’s ambition to become a global aviation powerhouse has been highlighted due to increasing collaboration between the two nations in the aviation sector.
What are the key challenges faced by the India-UAE aviation sector?
Restricted Bilateral Air Service Agreements:
Limited flight frequencies and destination access for both Indian and UAE carriers.
Example:
UAE airlines can operate flights to only
15 Indian cities
, excluding key growth centers like Surat and Indore despite high passenger demand.
Capacity Constraints and Rising Airfares: Limited flight slots
lead to insufficient capacity, causing increased ticket prices.
During peak travel seasons
, such as festivals or school holidays, airfares between India and the UAE surge due to restricted airline capacity.
Limited Connectivity to Emerging Cities:
Many
Tier-2 and Tier-3 Indian cities
lack direct UAE connections.
Business hubs like
Visakhapatnam
Patna
face limited or no direct international flights to the UAE, restricting trade and tourism.
Inability to Meet Growing Passenger Demand:
Rapid growth in Indian outbound travel is unmet by the current aviation framework.
Despite
4.5 million Indian tourists
visiting the UAE in 2023, airlines struggle to increase operations due to bilateral restrictions.
Missed Economic and Strategic Opportunities:
Limited flight options restrict business engagement, investment, and tourism growth.
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)
between India and the UAE aims to boost trade, but insufficient air connectivity hinders the free flow of goods and professionals.
Why is there a need for a modernized aviation strategy between India and the UAE?
Meeting Rising Passenger Demand:
A revised aviation strategy is crucial to handle the increasing flow of Indian travelers to the UAE.
For every 1% increase in passport holders, approximately
10 million additional Indian travelers
are expected, which the current framework cannot accommodate.
Lowering Airfares and Improving Access:
Expanding bilateral agreements can boost flight availability, foster competition and reduce travel costs.
During peak seasons
, limited flights cause
sharp increases in ticket prices
, making travel between India and the UAE expensive.
Expanding Connectivity to Regional Cities:
Modernising aviation policies can facilitate direct flights from
to the UAE, enhancing regional growth.
Cities like Surat, Patna, and Visakhapatnam
remain disconnected from the UAE, hindering trade, tourism, and cultural exchanges.
Boosting Trade and Economic Cooperation:
Improved air services can strengthen business ties and enhance trade between India and the UAE.
Despite the
CEPA agreement
aimed at fostering economic collaboration,
restricted flight options
limit the movement of professionals and goods.
Advancing Aviation Infrastructure and Innovation:
A modernized strategy encourages collaboration in
aviation technology and infrastructure
development.
UAE investments
in India’s
UDAN scheme
can improve regional connectivity and support India’s goal to become a leading aviation hub.
Which Indian cities are currently excluded from UAE airline operations despite growing demand?
Cities Not Fully Integrated:
Emirates has not yet expanded its services to cities like Amritsar, Lucknow, and Goa Mopa, despite growing demand. These cities are not explicitly excluded but rather await service expansion due to current operational limitations and bilateral agreements.
Bilateral Restrictions:
The current bilateral agreements between India and the UAE limit the number of seats available for UAE airlines, which can restrict the expansion of services to new cities. While there are no specific cities excluded, the capacity constraints under these agreements affect the ability of UAE airlines to meet demand in various Indian cities.
What initiatives can the UAE undertake to support India’s ambition to become a global aviation powerhouse?
Expanding Aviation Agreements:
The UAE-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) aims to improve air travel and cargo transport between the two countries. Increasing the current limits to 134,000 weekly passenger seats and 4,000 tonnes of cargo through relaxed rules can boost trade and improve connectivity.
Using UAE’s Logistics Strength:
The UAE’s major airports, like Dubai International and Al Maktoum International, can help meet India’s growing air cargo needs.
Working together can make cargo transport faster and more efficient between the two nations.
Improving India’s Aviation Sector:
India, as the third-largest domestic aviation market, can learn from the UAE to improve international flights and upgrade airport facilities.
Way forward:
Enhancing Policy Frameworks:
India can revise its aviation policies to allow greater flexibility in bilateral agreements, enabling increased flight frequencies and better access for UAE carriers.
Updating the Open Sky policy for Gulf nations can promote competition, reduce airfares, and improve passenger services.
Strengthening Aviation Infrastructure:
India can invest in upgrading airport capacity, regional connectivity, and advanced Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) facilities to accommodate increased traffic.

Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Gender Budget;
Why in the News?
The Union and State governments often express their commitment to women’s empowerment. One of the four main pillars of
Viksit Bharat 2047
is
women’s development
What are the three components of the gender budget?
Part A:
Schemes with 100% allocation for women and girls. Example: Beti Bachao Beti Padhao – a scheme focused entirely on improving the welfare of girls.
Part B:
Schemes with 30% to 99% allocation for women and girls. Example: National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) – where a significant portion is directed toward maternal and child healthcare.
Part C:
Schemes with less than 30% allocation for women and girls (introduced in 2024-25). Example: Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) – where a small portion benefits women, though the primary beneficiaries are land-owning farmers.
Why is the agricultural sector’s allocation under the gender budget considered ineffective for women?
Land Ownership Inequality:
Most agricultural schemes, like
, are
land-linked
, and since agricultural land is typically
owned by men
, women are excluded from direct benefits.
provides
₹6,000 per year
to land-owning farmers, but women who work on the land without ownership
do not qualify
Limited Focus on Women Farmers:
There is
insufficient funding
for programs addressing the
specific needs
of women farmers, such as
access to credit
training
technology
Schemes like the
Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP)
, which focus on empowering women in agriculture, receive a
smaller share
of the gender budget.
Exclusion from Decision-Making:
Women in agriculture often lack
legal and institutional representation

Despite women forming a
significant share
of the agricultural workforce, they are underrepresented in
farmer producer organizations (FPOs)

Land-Owning Farmers:
The primary beneficiaries of the
scheme are
small and marginal land-owning farmers
who receive

patriarchal households
, the registered
male family member
receives the PM-Kisan payments, excluding women working on the same land.
Joint Landholders (Primarily Men):
In cases of
joint land ownership
, the payment is usually disbursed to the
registered owner
, who is
more often a man
, rather than women co-owners.
If a piece of farmland is jointly owned by a husband and wife,
the husband
is more likely to be listed as the primary beneficiary.
Why are women often excluded from its advantages?
Lack of Land Ownership: Women
often do not hold
legal ownership
of agricultural land, making them
ineligible
for PM-Kisan benefits, as the scheme is limited to
landowners
A woman working on her family’s farmland
cannot receive
PM-Kisan payments if the land is
in her husband’s name.
Patriarchal Inheritance Practices: Customary inheritance laws
patriarchal norms
often prevent women from
inheriting land
, limiting their access to
direct agricultural benefits
In many rural areas, agricultural land is
passed down
sons
daughters
from ownership and thus from PM-Kisan benefits.
Administrative and Documentation Barriers:
Women face
challenges
in providing
legal documents
(such as land records or identity proof) required to register as beneficiaries under the scheme.
Widowed or
