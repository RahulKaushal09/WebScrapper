India calls for safety of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon
Why in news?
India expressed concern over the worsening security situation in West Asia after two UN peacekeepers were injured near Lebanon's border with Israel.
The incident occurred when an Israeli tank fired on a UN observation tower. This marks the most serious escalation since Israel asked the UN peacekeeping force, UNIFIL, to relocate from positions near Hezbollah rocket launch sites in Lebanon. The request was declined by the UN.
UNIFIL, present in southern Lebanon since 1978, has an observational mandate that was expanded in 2006 following the Israel-Hezbollah war.

UN Peacekeeping
About
The UN Charter gives the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.
In fulfilling this responsibility, the Council can establish a UN peace operation.
Peacekeeping mandates
UN peace operations are deployed on the basis of mandates from the United Nations Security Council.
These mandates differ from situation to situation, depending on the nature of the conflict and the specific challenges it presents.
Depending on their mandate, peace operations may be required to:
Deploy to prevent the outbreak of conflict or the spill-over of conflict across borders;
Stabilize conflict situations after a ceasefire;
Assist in implementing comprehensive peace agreements;
Lead states or territories through a transition to stable government, based on democratic principles, good governance and economic development.
Principles
Consent of the parties
In the absence of such consent, a peacekeeping operation risks becoming a party to the conflict; and being drawn towards enforcement action.
Impartiality
Peacekeepers should be impartial in their dealings with the parties to the conflict, but not neutral in the execution of their mandate.
Non-use of force except in self-defence and defence of the mandate
Current status
India is one of the largest troop contributing nation to UNPK.
Currently, India has around 5,900 troops deployed in 12 U.N. Missions.
India’s contribution to the peacekeeping budget stands at 0.16%.
Contribution so far
India has been actively participating in peacekeeping right from 1950 when it supplied medical personnel and troops to the UN Repatriation Commission in Korea.
India has contributed approximately 2,75,000 troops to peacekeeping missions so far and 159 Indian Army soldiers have lost their lives across the globe.
Joint training of U.N. peacekeepers from African countries
In 2016, India and the U.S. had begun an annual training programme for joint training of U.N. peacekeepers from African countries.
Centre for United Nations Peacekeeping (CUNPK)
Indian Army has established a CUNPK in New Delhi to impart training in peacekeeping operations and the Centre trains more than 12,000 troops every year.
Women deployment
India has deployed Female Engagement Teams in United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei.
This is the second largest women contingent after Liberia.
India has also deployed Women Military Police in United Nations Disengagement Observer Force and women staff officers and military observers in various missions.
Other contributions
In August 2021, India, in collaboration with the UN launched UNITE AWARE platform.
It is a technology platform to ensure the safety and security of peacekeepers.
India has also proposed a 10-point plan, including making those targeting UN peacekeepers more accountable.
It also suggested to build a memorial wall to honour peacekeepers.
The UNIFIL is an international peacekeeping mission with over 10,000 civilian and military personnel from 50 countries, tasked with preventing violations along the 121-km "Blue Line" border between Lebanon and Israel.
Established under a 2006 UN resolution, the force is responsible for ensuring the area is free of hostile activities, including the presence of weapons or fighters.
However, the U.S. and Israel have criticized UNIFIL for being ineffective in preventing Hezbollah from stockpiling and firing rockets.
Though armed, the peacekeepers can only use force when their safety or civilians are in immediate danger, and they report violations to the UN Security Council.
Issue – attack on UNIFIL
During its invasion of southern Lebanon, the Israeli military set up new positions near a UNIFIL base, using these sites to fire at Hezbollah targets, which increased the risk to UN peacekeepers.
Despite requests from Israel to relocate, UNIFIL declined to move.
Attacks on UN personnel are illegal under international law, but Hezbollah has been launching rockets from areas close to UN positions for a year, complicating the situation.
Recently, Israeli tank fire hit a UN observation tower and the entrance of a bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering at a UNIFIL base in Naqoura, Lebanon.

**********WTO Lowers Global Trade Growth Forecast Amid West Asia Conflict
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background
Impact of West Asia Conflict (Forecast for Global Trade, Regional Outlook, Europe’s Performance, etc.)
Background:
The
World Trade Organization (WTO)
has revised its growth forecast for global merchandise trade for 2025, lowering it to
3% from the earlier estimate of 3.3%
The revision comes in the wake of
intensifying conflicts in West Asia
, which have disrupted key shipping routes, particularly the
Red Sea corridor
, and are expected to further impact global trade flows and energy prices.
Impact of the West Asia Conflict on Global Trade:
The ongoing conflict in West Asia has escalated, with recent military operations by Israel targeting the
Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah
in Lebanon.
This follows heightened tensions and violent incidents in the region, including explosions targeting Hezbollah members and the assassination of its long-time leader,
Hassan Nasrallah
These events have raised concerns about the future stability of trade in the region, given that
West Asia plays a crucial role in global petroleum production and international shipping routes
The WTO expressed concerns that the conflict could worsen, potentially leading to
further disruptions in global shipping
rising energy prices
as risk premiums increase.
The WTO warned that any
disruption to energy supplies
from West Asia, a major hub for oil production, could significantly dampen
economic growth in importing economies
, further straining global trade.
Forecasts for Global Trade and GDP Growth:
In light of these challenges, WTO economists forecast global merchandise trade growth at
2.7% for 2024
, followed by
3% in 2025
This marks a slight downward revision from earlier projections, with a similar forecast for
global GDP growth
, which is expected to remain at
2.7% for both 2024 and 2025
The latest revisions come after WTO's April 2024 forecast, which had estimated
2.6% growth in trade and GDP
in 2024, followed by
3.3% trade growth
2.7% GDP growth
in 2025.
Regional Outlook - India, Vietnam, and Asia's Emerging Role:
Despite the global slowdown in trade,
India and Vietnam
are emerging as key players in global exports.
The WTO highlighted the
growing role of these nations
as “
connecting economies
,” demonstrating strong export growth in recent years.
The recovery in
Asian exports
has been fuelled by leading manufacturing economies such as
China, Singapore
South Korea
These nations have played a crucial role in revitalizing the region’s trade, with growing demand for their manufacturing exports.
However, not all Asian economies are experiencing growth.
Japan
, for instance, is expected to witness
stagnant exports in 2024
following a contraction in 2023.
The WTO notes that Japan's trade struggles are mainly due to challenges in its export sectors, specifically in industries like
machinery and technology
Europe’s Drag on Global Trade Performance:
In contrast to Asia's export growth,
Europe’s performance
continues to weigh heavily on global merchandise trade.
The WTO identified Europe as a
drag on both imports and exports
, with significant contractions observed in the
chemicals
automotive
Organic chemicals
, which had seen a surge in demand during the pandemic due to their use in medicines, are now returning to pre-pandemic trends, leading to a decrease in trade activity.
European imports, particularly in
, have also declined, with a noticeable reduction in imports from
The WTO clarified that this decline is not solely due to
geopolitical tensions
but also reflects broader
global economic trends
, with similar reductions seen in other economies like the
United States, South Korea
Diverging Monetary Policies and Financial Volatility Risks:
The WTO also warned that
diverging monetary policies
across major economies could lead to
financial volatility
As different countries adopt varying stances on interest rates and inflation control, there is a risk of sudden shifts in
exchange rates or capital flows
, which could make
debt servicing difficult for poorer economies
The WTO emphasized that policymakers face a delicate balancing act—acting too cautiously could result in
economic slowdowns
, while aggressive policy moves could trigger
rising inflation
Fragmentation of Trade Flows Due to Geopolitical Tensions:
Since the onset of the
Russia-Ukraine war
, the WTO has observed increasing
fragmentation of global trade flows
Trade routes and economic alliances are increasingly reorienting along
geopolitical lines
, with countries forming new trade blocs and shifting import-export strategies.
This fragmentation is likely to further complicate the global trade landscape in the coming years.
Conclusion:
WTO's reduced forecast
for global trade growth reflects the numerous challenges facing the global economy, from
in West Asia to
economic risks
stemming from divergent monetary policies.
While countries like
offer bright spots in the global trade landscape, others, such as
Japan and Europe
, face more difficult paths ahead.
As the conflict in West Asia and global financial instability continue to evolve, these factors will shape the future trajectory of global trade and economic growth.
Countries will need to adapt to these challenges by fostering
regional cooperation
, supporting
trade diversification
, and enhancing
resilience in supply chains
to navigate an increasingly complex global trade environment.

**********Addressing Hunger and Malnutrition in India
Why in News?
India's struggle with hunger and malnutrition has been underscored by its ranking in the
2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI),
where it stands
105th out of 127 countries
with a score of 27.3, categorising it in the
'serious' range
Despite being one of the fastest-growing economies globally, India continues to lag behind several of its South Asian neighbours, highlighting the urgent need for effective interventions.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the GHI?
Highlights of the 19th GHI 2024
India Specific Findings in the GHI 2024
India's Performance Trends in the GHI
The GHI is
a peer-reviewed annual publication designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger at global, regional, and national levels
, reflecting multiple dimensions of hunger over time.
Created in 2006
, the GHI was initially published by the US-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and Germany-based Welthungerhilfe. In 2007, the Irish NGO Concern Worldwide also became a co-publisher.
In 2018
, IFPRI withdrew from the project and the GHI became a joint project of
Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide.
The GHI is intended to -
Raise awareness
and understanding of the struggle against hunger,
Provide a way to compare
levels of hunger between countries and regions, and
Call attention
to those areas of the world where hunger levels are highest and where the need for additional efforts to eliminate hunger is greatest.
Highlights of the 19th GHI 2024:
Theme:
The theme for the 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI) is "How gender justice can advance climate resilience and zero hunger".
Global hunger statistics:
Current GHI score:
8.3 shows a slight improvement from 2016's score of 18.8.
Vulnerable populations:
2.8 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet.
Regional disparities in hunger:
Sub-Saharan Africa:
Highest rates of malnutrition and child mortality globally and ongoing conflicts in Somalia and Sudan exacerbate hunger crises.
South Asia:
Countries like Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan are facing substantial hunger challenges.
Issues:
Difficulties in achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger by 2030):
The GHI 2024 reveals that 42 countries face alarming or serious hunger levels, marking a stagnation in the fight against hunger despite decades of progress.
Gender disparity:
Women are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity due to discriminatory norms and violence, limiting their access to resources.
Underlying causes of hunger:
Climate change and environmental degradation
impacts food production and threatens the natural foundations of economies and agriculture.
Armed conflicts
lead to significant displacement and disruption in food systems and affect cultivation.
Lower-income countries struggle with debt
, diverting funds away from critical development needs.
Success stories amidst the crisis:
Mozambique and Nepal
have achieved significant improvements in their GHI scores since 2016, showcasing that progress is possible.
A call to action:
The GHI 2024 underscores the urgent need for coordinated efforts to address the intersecting crises of climate change, armed conflict, gender inequality and economic instability.
It emphasises the importance of supporting vulnerable populations, particularly women, in the fight against hunger.
India Specific Findings in the GHI 2024:
Alarming child malnutrition rates:
Approximately 35.5% of children under five are stunted, indicating chronic undernutrition, while 18.7% are wasted, a sign of acute malnutrition.
These figures reflect
a significant lack of adequate nutrition during crucial developmental periods
, severely impacting children's physical and cognitive growth.
Furthermore, around 13.7% of the overall population suffers from undernourishment, which remains a persistent issue.
Child mortality rates:
While there has been some progress in reducing child mortality, with 2.9% of children dying before their fifth birthday, the overall hunger situation remains dire.
The interplay between malnutrition and child mortality underscores the need for immediate action.
India's Performance Trends in the GHI:
Minimal improvement over the decade:
There is a stagnation in India’s performance as it moved from a score of
29.3 in 2016 to 27.3 in 2024
Although there have been gains in certain areas, such as child mortality rates, the overarching issue of hunger persists.
India vs. neighbours:
When compared to neighbouring countries like
Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh
each of which has fewer economic resources
- India's performance on the GHI is particularly alarming.
This indicates that economic growth alone does not necessarily lead to improved nutritional outcomes.
Addressing Hunger and Malnutrition in India:
The need for comprehensive solutions:
India's GHI score serves as a stark reminder that economic advancement is insufficient for eradicating hunger.
A more holistic approach is required to tackle the underlying causes of malnutrition.
Effective policy interventions including key focus areas such as:
Food security:
Ensuring access to nutritious food for all segments of the population is essential.
Healthcare access:
Improving healthcare infrastructure can significantly impact maternal and child health outcomes.
Maternal and child nutrition programs:
Investing in targeted nutritional programs for mothers and children is vital for breaking the cycle of malnutrition.
Some initiatives in India:
National Food Security Act (NFSA), PM POSHAN Scheme, etc.

**********International NGOs and the Perils of Outsourcing Development
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to population control;
Why in the News?
For many years, International NGOs (INGOs) have promoted donor-driven agendas that have frequently caused harm to local communities.
Case Study: Africa and Bolivia
Tanzania and Kenya (Africa)
: In these regions, INGO-led conservation efforts, often backed by Western donors, displaced indigenous
Maasai communities
from their ancestral lands. These interventions were justified as conservation projects but disregarded local rights and livelihoods, leading to social and economic harm for the Maasai.
Bolivia (Cochabamba)
: Water privatization, supported by INGOs and international donors, restricted access to basic water resources, sparking widespread public outcry.
The privatization, part of broader neoliberal reforms, was later reversed due to local resistance, revealing the negative effects of donor-driven agendas on essential public services.
What are the Historical roots of Gender Imbalance?
Colonial Policies
: British colonial land reforms in the
18th and 19th centuries
, especially among land-owning castes, exacerbated
female infanticide
due to several socio-economic factors linked to
inheritance, property rights,
structure
of agrarian society.
Post-Independence Malthusian Fears
: Following independence, fears of overpopulation dominated Western perceptions of India, and INGOs, influenced by these Malthusian concerns, promoted population control measures.
Note:
originate from the ideas of Thomas Malthus, an 18th-century British scholar. In his 1798 work,
An Essay on the Principle of Population
Malthus argued that population growth would outpace food production, leading to widespread famine, disease, and societal collapse.
Role of INGOs in Worsening Gender Imbalance in India
Population Control Focus
: INGOs such as the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, and Population Council were instrumental in introducing sex-determination technologies, particularly between the
1950s and 1980s,
by directing significant funds towards these efforts while sidelining other public health needs.
Influence in Institutions
: INGOs embedded themselves in key Indian institutions such as AIIMS and the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), shaping the direction of research and policy towards population management.
For example,
Sheldon Segal of the Population Council
worked closely with the Indian Health Ministry to prioritize family planning over other pressing health concerns like tuberculosis and malaria.
Promotion of Sex Selection
: Doctors, influenced by the donor-driven agendas of INGOs, began promoting sex-determination technologies like amniocentesis under the pretext of reducing
“unnecessary fecundity.”
Impact of Sex Determination Technology
Introduction and Spread
: Sex determination technologies, such as amniocentesis and ultrasound,  Initially intended for detecting fetal abnormalities, they were quickly co-opted for sex selection, leading to a significant increase in female foeticide.
Census data reveals a steady decrease from 943 girls per 1,000 boys in 1951 to 927 girls per 1,000 boys by 1991. The sharpest fall occurred between 1971 and 1991, coinciding with the spread of these technologies.
Regional Variations
: States with easier access to sex-determination tests, such as Punjab and Haryana, experienced the
steepest declines
in their child sex ratios.
By 2001, Punjab’s ratio had dropped to 876 girls per 1,000 boys, while Haryana’s fell to 861.
Missing Girls
: A 2006 study published in
The Lancet
estimated that sex-determination technologies contributed to the
loss of 10 million female births
in India between 1980 and 2010, with approximately 500,000 female foetuses aborted annually during this period.
Way forward:
Strengthen Legal Enforcement and Awareness
: Enforce stricter penalties for illegal sex determination practices and raise public awareness to shift societal norms that value male children over female children, promoting gender equality at all levels.
Focus on Holistic Public Health and Gender Policies
: Redirect INGO and government efforts toward comprehensive health programs, prioritizing women’s health, education, and economic empowerment, rather than solely focusing on population control.
**********Workplace carcinogens are increasingly a global problem
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues in the Workplace;
Why in the News?
Data indicates that Central Europe and the wealthiest nations in Asia are approaching the cancer rates from workplace exposure to carcinogens seen in Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
Carcinogens are associated with Occupational Cancer:
Asbestos:
A major contributor to lung cancer and mesothelioma, responsible for the highest number of deaths is related to occupational exposure.
Benzene:
Associated with leukemia and bladder cancer; prevalent in chemical industries.
Silica:
Linked to lung cancer; significant exposure occurs in construction and mining.
Diesel Engine Exhaust:
Contributes to lung cancer and other respiratory issues.
Secondhand Smoke:
Increases risk of lung cancer among workers in smoke-exposed environments.
Arsenic, Beryllium, Cadmium, Chromium:
Various cancers are associated with these substances, including kidney and lung cancers.
Data Trends on Cancer from Workplace Exposure:
Western Europe and Australasia
historically had the highest rates of death from cancers attributed to workplace carcinogens. These regions have maintained the highest mortality rates for over three decades.
Southeast Asia
countries like Singapore, Japan, Brunei, and South Korea have seen their cancer death rates from occupational exposure triple since 1990. This increase correlates with their growing manufacturing sectors.
In Central Europe and East Asia,
death rates have doubled in Central Europe and increased by 2.5 times in East Asia since 1990. The rise is attributed to a large manufacturing economy that often lacks stringent safety regulations.
International guidelines:
World Health Organization (WHO):
The WHO emphasizes the need for primary prevention by avoiding exposure to carcinogens. They recommend specific interventions, such as banning asbestos and introducing benzene-free alternatives. WHO also advocates for comprehensive national cancer control programs that include occupational health standards.
International Labour Organization (ILO):
The ILO has established conventions and recommendations aimed at preventing occupational hazards caused by carcinogenic substances. These include:
Replacement of carcinogenic substances with less dangerous alternatives.
Establishing lists of prohibited or controlled carcinogens.
Implementing medical surveillance and exposure monitoring
Way forward:
Strengthen Regulations and Enforcement
: Implement and enforce stricter occupational health and safety regulations, including banning or limiting the use of known carcinogens, such as asbestos and benzene, and promoting safer alternatives in industries.
Enhance Awareness and Training
: Develop comprehensive training programs for workers and employers on the risks of carcinogens, safe handling practices, and the importance of regular health monitoring to prevent occupational cancers.
**********As the green patch spreads in Antarctica, here’s what is worrying scientists
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of global warming;
Why in the News?
A new study reveals that plant cover on the Antarctic Peninsula, a mountainous region extending towards South America, has increased more than tenfold in recent decades due to rising temperatures.
What has the study found?
Vegetation in the Antarctic Peninsula increased
14-fold between 1986 and 2021,
expanding from less than 1 sq km to nearly 12 sq km.
Mosses and lichens dominate
this vegetation, with greening accelerating by 30% between 2016 and 2021.
The changes are linked to anthropogenic climate change and observed through satellite data.
How quickly is Antarctica warming?
Antarctica is warming
twice as fast
as the global average, at 0.22-0.32°C per decade (compared to 0.14-0.18°C globally).
Peninsula is warming five times faste
r than the global average and is now almost 3°C warmer than in 1950.
Record-breaking heatwaves have occurred, with temperatures rising up to 28°C above normal in July 2023 and 39°C above normal in March 2022.
Why should we worry about increased vegetation in Antarctica?
Invasive Species
: Warming temperatures and increased vegetation disrupt the ecological balance, allowing non-native species to
outcompete native flora
like mosses and lichens, leading to reduced biodiversity and altered habitats.
Albedo Effect
: Increased plant cover lowers the albedo effect, resulting in
greater solar energy absorption
and further warming, creating a feedback loop that promotes additional vegetation growth.
Soil Formation
: Plant life accelerates soil development by adding organic matter,
enhancing nutrient cycling
, and creating a more hospitable environment for non-native species, thereby increasing the risk of invasives.
Ice Loss and Sea-Level Rise
: Higher temperatures from warming and the albedo effect lead to increased
ice melt,
contributing to
global sea-level rise
, which threatens coastal ecosystems and human settlements with flooding and erosion.
Way forward:
Strengthen climate action
: Accelerate global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, focusing on renewable energy and sustainable practices to mitigate further warming in Antarctica.
Monitor ecosystems
: Establish stricter biosecurity measures and enhanced monitoring to prevent invasive species from spreading and disrupting Antarctica’s fragile ecosystem.
Promote global cooperation
: Increase international collaboration on Antarctic research, focusing on climate change impacts, ecosystem protection, and adaptation strategies to minimize global sea-level rise and biodiversity loss.
Mains PYQ:
Major cities of India are becoming vulnerable to flood conditions. Discuss.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Hurricane Milton made
landfall near Siesta Key, Florida, USA
which caused heavy rain, flooding and strong winds resulting in significant damage and loss of lives.
What is a Hurricane?
A hurricane is a large, powerful
cyclonic storm
that forms over
warm ocean waters
Hurricanes mostly occur in the
Atlantic Ocean
Gulf of Mexico
, and the
Caribbean Sea
They usually form when
sea-surface temperatures
above 26°C
Warm water causes
evaporation
, which fuels the storm as it gathers strength and moisture.
These storms typically
develop in the late summer
and early fall, which is the
Atlantic hurricane season
(June to November).
Global Terminology:
Typhoon
: Northwest Pacific Ocean.
: North Atlantic, Central and Eastern North Pacific Oceans.
Cyclone
: South Pacific and Indian Ocean.
Hurricane Milton: Origin and Causes
Hurricane Milton was a powerful storm that made landfall in
, causing
widespread damage
It was a
Category 5
hurricane with
wind speeds of 285 km/h
, making it one of the strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the
It originated in the
, an area connected to the
Why it was an unusual storm?
Milton went from a
Category 1
storm to a
storm in just
12 hours
Usually,
hurricanes intensify at a slower pace
, but Milton’s wind speeds increased by
145 km/h
in one day
, which is very rare.
Sea-surface temperatures
31°C
were much higher than the
needed for hurricane formation.
This excess heat allowed Milton to intensify quickly.
Most hurricanes follow a westward path, but Milton moved
eastward
and made landfall on the
western coast of Florida
According to scientists, very few hurricanes have taken this path before.
Wind shear
is a change in wind speed and direction that can weaken hurricanes.
In Milton’s case, there was almost no wind shear, allowing the storm to grow stronger without interference.
