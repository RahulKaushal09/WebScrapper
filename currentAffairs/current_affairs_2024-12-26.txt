GOVERNORS: APPOINTMENT AND TRANSFER
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
Context:
Government announced new gubernatorial appointments, including former Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla as Governor of Manipur and former Army Chief V K Singh as Governor of Mizoram. Among the other appointments by President are: Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan as Governor of Bihar; Mizoram Governor Dr Hari Babu Kambhampati as Governor of Odisha; and Bihar Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar as Governor of Kerala.
Background: –
The choice of Bhalla as Manipur Governor is significant as the Centre has been struggling to control the ethnic violence in the state for over one-and-a-half years. Bhalla was Union Home Secretary when the violence began on May 3, 2023.
Key takeaways
Article 153 of the Constitution says “There shall be a Governor for each State.” A few years after the commencement of the Constitution, an amendment in 1956 laid down that “nothing in this article shall prevent the appointment of the same person as Governor for two or more States”.
Article 155 says that the “Governor of a State shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal”.
Under Article 156, “the Governor shall hold office during the pleasure of the President”, but his normal term of office will be five years. If the President withdraws her pleasure before the completion of five years, the Governor has to step down. Since the President acts on the aid and advice of the Prime Minister and the Union Council of Ministers, in effect, the Governor is appointed and removed by the central government.
Articles 157 and 158 lay down the qualifications of the Governor and the conditions of his office.
The Governor must be a citizen of India and should have completed the age of 35 years. The Governor should not be a member of Parliament or a state legislature, and must not hold any other office of profit.
Powers and Functions
Executive Powers : Article 154 – The executive power of the State shall be vested in the Governor and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with this Constitution.
The Governor appoints the Chief Minister and other ministers based on their majority in the Legislative Assembly (Article 164).
Key Appointments: Appoints the Advocate General (Article 165), State Election Commissioner (Article 243K), and members of the State Public Service Commission.
Legislative Powers
Summoning and Dissolution: Summons, prorogues, and dissolves the state legislature (Article 174).
Addresses the legislative assembly at the beginning of its first session (Article 176).
Assent to Bills: Can give or withhold assent to bills, or reserve them for the President’s consideration (Article 200).
Ordinances: Can promulgate ordinances during recess of the legislature (Article 213).
Judicial Powers
Can grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, or suspend, remit, or commute sentences in cases involving state laws (Article 161).

CONCERN OVER PLAN TO REDESIGN SIKKIM DAM WASHED AWAY IN 2023
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
A Union environment ministry expert panel has expressed serious concerns about the redesign of the 1,200 MW Teesta-III Chungthang Dam in Sikkim, which was washed away after a glacial lake outburst in October 2023, and deferred its nod for restarting the project with a new dam.
The expert appraisal committee (EAC) appraising hydroelectric and river-valley-sector projects said it had concerns regarding the dam’s design and stability and its ability to withstand potential natural disasters in the future.
Government enterprise Sikkim Urja Limited has sought an amendment to the project’s old environmental clearance as it has proposed to redesign the project dam. It wants to replace the washed-away, concrete-faced rockfill dam with a concrete gravity dam.
On the intervening night of October 3 and October 4, an ice avalanche hit the South Lhonak Lake, located at an altitude of 5,200 metres, breaching the glacial lake. The avalanche created giant waves, leading to a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), and triggered a flash flood downstream in Teesta.
The force of the floodwaters breached the Chungthang dam, exacerbating the floods, killing 40 people across four districts of Sikkim. Across Mangan, Gangtok, Pakyong, and Namchi districts, about 100 villages were affected and 76 people were reported missing.
The Teesta-III project is in Mangan district and utilises a drop of about 800m in the Teesta River between Chungthang and Sankalang villages. The flash floods triggered by the GLOF event had overtopped the project dam and flooded the underground powerhouse, bringing power generation to a halt.
Following the GLOF event, the Centre and Sikkim government are collaborating on reducing levels of potentially risky glacial lakes in the upper reaches of Mangan district. The Centre has approved a Rs 150 crore National GLOF Risk Mitigation Programme and 189 lakes have been identified as high-risk glacial lakes, to mitigate the risks they pose.

KEN-BETWA LINK PROJECT (KBLP) LAUNCHED
Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Ken-Betwa river-linking project in Madhya Pradesh’s Khajuraho, aimed at solving the water woes of the Bundelkhand region, spread across parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
The Ken-Betwa Link Project is the first project under India’s National Perspective Plan for interlinking rivers, which was prepared in 1980. This plan has 16 projects under its peninsular component, including the KBLP. Apart from this, 14 links are proposed under the Himalayan rivers development plan.
The Ken-Betwa Link Project (KBLP) is a major river interlinking project in India with a project outlay of ₹45,000 crore.
Objective: The project aims to transfer water from the Ken River to the Betwa River, both tributaries of the Yamuna. This will provide irrigation to 10.62 lakh hectares (8.11 lakh hectares in Madhya Pradesh and 2.51 lakh hectares in Uttar Pradesh), supply drinking water to about 62 lakh people, and generate 103 MW of hydropower and 27 MW of solar power.
Components: The project includes the construction of the Daudhan Dam, a 77-meter-high, 2.13-kilometer-long dam within the Panna Tiger Reserve, and a 221-kilometer canal linking the Ken and Betwa Rivers.
The Ken-Betwa Link Project has two phases.
Phase-I will involve building the Daudhan Dam complex and its subsidiary units such as the Low Level Tunnel, High Level Tunnel, Ken-Betwa Link Canal and power houses.
Daudhan dam is 2,031 m long, out of which 1,233 metre will be earthen and the rest 798 m will be of concrete. According to the Jal Shakti Ministry, the dam will submerge about 9,000 hectares of land, affecting 10 villages.
Phase-II will involve three components — Lower Orr Dam, Bina Complex Project and Kotha Barrage.
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-200705" decoding="async" height="268" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/26-dec-dna-300x268.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/26-dec-dna-300x268.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/26-dec-dna.png 608w" width="300"/>
What are the project’s likely environmental and social impacts?
The Supreme Court’s Central Empowered Committee (CEC) had questioned the project on multiple counts while examining its wildlife clearance. The CEC had raised questions on the economic viability of the project, advocating for first exhausting other irrigation options in the upper Ken basin.
The submergence of around 98 sq km of Panna national park and felling of about two to three million trees has been one of the most controversial aspects of the project. The Daudhan dam is situated inside the national park.
The Union environment ministry approved its construction inside the core of the Panna tiger reserve, despite no precedent of such heavy infrastructure projects deep within national parks and tiger reserves.
Downstream of the national park, the Daudham dam is also likely to affect the Gharial population in the Ken Gharial sanctuary along with vulture nesting sites, the CEC had noted.

FREE MOVEMENT REGIME (FMR)
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
Months after announcing that the Free Movement Regime (FMR) along the Myanmar border has been entirely suspended, the Union Home Ministry has brought in fresh protocol to regulate the movement of people living within 10 kilometres on either side of the largely unfenced international border.
Home Minister Amit Shah had announced in February that the FMR had been scrapped to ensure internal security and to maintain the demographic structure of the northeast. However, the new guidelines indicate that the regime has not been done away with but stricter regulations, such as reducing the range of free movement to 10 km from the earlier 16 km, have been introduced.
The Assam Rifles is the primary border guarding force along the 1,643-km-long border with Myanmar along the States of Arunachal Pradesh (520 km), Nagaland (215 km), Manipur (398 km) and Mizoram (510 km).
The Free Movement Regime (FMR) is a bilateral agreement between India and Myanmar that allows people living along the border to move freely within 16 (now reduced to 10) kilometers on either side without needing a visa.
what is the genesis of the FMR?
The roots of this regime go back to the late 19th century when both nations were part of the British Empire. The regulation allowed free movement across borders within British territories. After independence in 1947 (India) and 1948 (Myanmar), the two countries continued the arrangement under a revised bilateral agreement in 1967.
However, India and Myanmar established the FMR in 2018 as part of New Delhi’s Act East Policy promoting cross-border movement of people up to 16 km without a visa.
The FMR facilitates easier movement and interactions for people residing in the border areas of both nations, allowing them to meet relatives and carry out economic activities.

New rules
For entry into India from Myanmar, individuals will have to report at the designated border crossing points and fill a form.
The Assam Rifles will conduct the document inspection followed by a security and health check by the State police and health department officials, respectively.
The Assam Rifles will upload all the forms on the Indo-Myanmar Border portal, record biometrics, and issue a border pass with a photograph of the applicant and a QR code. The pass will have to be deposited on return at the same crossing point before completion of seven days.
The protocol stated that the police will do physical checks to verify the visit of Myanmar nationals as per the details provided in the border pass and anyone violating the conditions will face legal action.

**********Ocean Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a)
A recent study published in Science Advances has refined the timing and duration of Ocean Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a) by analyzing prehistoric rocks and fossils from Mount Ashibetsu, Japan.
About Ocean Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a):
OAE 1a occurred during the
Cretaceous Period (145–66 million years ago)
, marking a time when
Earth’s oceans became depleted of oxygen
. This led to severe disruptions in
marine ecosystems
It was
triggered by
massive volcanic eruptions
, which released large amounts of
carbon dioxide (CO₂)
, resulting in
global warming
oxygen depletion
in the oceans.
These conditions created
anoxic marine basins
, where oxygen levels were nearly absent.
Impacts
: The interaction of
CO₂ and seawater
formed
carbonic acid
, dissolving marine organisms’ shells and reducing oxygen levels.
Resulted in the extinction of several marine species, particularly
plankton
, and led to the formation of
black shales
, organic carbon-rich layers preserved in geological records.
Anoxic marine basins:
Bodies of water, often in
deep ocean regions
, where oxygen levels are extremely low or absent.
Characteristics
: Favor the survival of specialized microbes and fungi while inhibiting most aerobic life forms.
Carbon Sequestration
: Low oxygen levels slow the decomposition of organic matter, aiding in
long-term carbon sequestration
, which helps reduce atmospheric CO₂ levels.
Examples
Black Sea
Cariaco Basin
(Caribbean Sea), and
Orca Basin
(Gulf of Mexico).
Key Highlights of the Recent Study:
Timing
: The event began
119.5 million years ago
, confirmed through isotopic analysis of
volcanic tuffs
from Japan’s Hokkaido Island.
OAE 1a lasted approximately
1.1 million years
, indicating the extended recovery period for oceans after CO₂-driven warming and anoxia.
Volcanic activity
: Linked to massive volcanic eruptions, such as the
Ontong Java Nui complex
, which released significant CO₂ into the atmosphere and oceans.
Modern relevance
: Highlights parallels between ancient volcanic CO₂ emissions and
current human-induced warming
Warns that rapid modern warming could trigger similar disruptions in
and potentially lead to a
Holocene extinction event

**********Mitochondrial DNA Mutations and Age-Related Muscle Loss
A recent study published in Genome Research highlights that deletion mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) play a significant role in age-related muscle loss.
What are Mitochondria?
Mitochondria are
membrane-bound organelles
present in the cytoplasm of most eukaryotic cells,
They are often called the
"powerhouses" of the cell
, due to their role in the aerobic respiration, where
metabolite of glucose
is utilized to yield
ATP and Carbon dioxide
, and oxygen is reduced to water.
ATP is the energy currency in living organisms.
Other functions of Mitochondria:
Regulating cell death
: Control
apoptosis
, ensuring the maintenance of healthy tissues.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
: Contains its own DNA, which is prone to mutations that significantly affect cellular functions.
Mitochondria are inherited
exclusively from the mother
via the egg cell.
Findings on the mtDNA Mutations:
Deletion mutation’s role
: Deletion mutations in mtDNA reduce its size and functionality, gradually
eroding mitochondrial efficiency
These mutated mtDNA molecules
outcompete healthy ones
, leading to a decline in ATP production.
Chimeric genes
: Deletion mutations create
chimeric genes
by fusing different mitochondrial genes, forming abnormal sequences.
Chimeric genes disrupt mtDNA expression, accelerating mitochondrial dysfunction and muscle degradation.
Age-related changes
: Older individuals exhibit a
two-fold increase in chimeric mitochondrial mRNA
, correlating with biological aging.
Mutations also affect
brain and muscle tissues
, emphasizing their systemic impact on aging.
Biomarkers for biological ageing
mtDNA deletion mutations
chimeric mRNA
are key indicators of biological aging.
Understanding these markers could pave the way for therapies to
prevent or repair mutations
, delaying age-related muscle loss.

**********Imaging Active Hydrothermal Vents
India's Deep Ocean Mission recently achieved a landmark by capturing high-resolution images of an active hydrothermal vent 4,500 meters below the Indian Ocean’s surface.
About Hydrothermal Vents:
Hydrothermal vents are
underwater hot springs
near tectonic plate boundaries, expelling hot water and minerals from beneath the Earth's crust into the ocean.
They were first identified in
1977
near the
Galapagos Islands
, Ecuador.
Formation
Cold seawater (around
2°C
) seeps through fissures in the oceanic crust near tectonic activity,
The water then contacts
hot magma
, heating to temperatures up to
370°C
or higher,
Superheated water then resurfaces as mineral-rich
hydrothermal fluids
, forming vents and plumes.
Types
Black Smokers
: Emit particle-laden fluids, primarily containing

**********20 Years After Indian Ocean Tsunami, India is Better Prepared
Context
On December 26, 2004, a catastrophic event
forever
changed the way the world perceived natural disasters and preparedness.
9.1 magnitude earthquake beneath the seabed off Indonesia unleashed a massive tsunami,
devastating countries bordering the Indian Ocean including India,
particularly the Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) Islands and the southern coastline.
Twenty years later,
reflections on this tragedy reveal the remarkable progress made in disaster preparedness
while underscoring the importance of continued vigilance and innovation.
The Tragedy and its Immediate Aftermath
In 2004, the
lack of a robust warning system and limited public understanding of tsunamis resulted in immense human and material losses.
tsunami struck the A&N Islands within 20 minutes of the earthquake,
and its waves travelled to India’s mainland and Sri Lanka within hours.
With no early warning (EW) mechanism in place,
people were caught off guard, exacerbating the scale of destruction.
The tragedy starkly highlighted deficiencies in India’s seismic monitoring network
and reliance on international seismic data, which delayed critical warnings.
Institutional and Technological Responses
Establishment of Institutional Frameworks
One of the most critical institutional responses
to the tsunami was the
enactment of the Disaster Management Act of 2005
, which created a legal framework for disaster preparedness, mitigation, and response.
This
legislation led to the formation of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)
, tasked with coordinating, and implementing disaster management plans across the country.
NDMA also emphasised integrating disaster risk reduction (DRR) into development planning and policies
, ensuring that disaster preparedness became a central part of governance.
Additionally,
state-level disaster management authorities were established to decentralise disaster response
and allow tailored approaches based on local vulnerabilities.
The NDMA, in collaboration with these state bodies, introduced training programs, guidelines, and awareness campaigns
to enhance community resilience.
Recognition of Collaboration between Civilian and Military Agencies
The tragedy also led to the
recognition of the importance of collaboration between civilian and military agencies.
Indian Armed Forces have since become key players in disaster response operations
, offering logistical support, rapid mobilisation, and expertise during crises.
Joint exercises, like those conducted at the Headquarters Andaman and Nicobar Command (HQ ANC), further enhance the readiness of armed forces
and civilian agencies to work together seamlessly.
Development of Early Warning Systems
Technological advancements have been at the forefront of India’s efforts to prevent a recurrence of the 2004 disaster.
The establishment of the
Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre (ITEWC) at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) in Hyderabad marked a significant leap forward.
Operational since 2007,
the ITEWC is now among the most advanced tsunami warning centres globally.
The ITEWC operates a real-time seismic monitoring network capable of detecting tsunamigenic earthquakes both in the Indian Ocean and globally within 10 minutes
of their occurrence.
This is made possible through a network of seismic stations and the integration of international seismic data,
ensuring comprehensive monitoring coverage.

**********US FDA approves use of weight loss drug for sleep apnoea
Why in news?
The FDA has approved Tirzepatide, marketed as Zepbound, for treating Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). The drug is recommended alongside a low-calorie diet and increased physical activity for individuals with moderate to severe OSA.
This approval highlights Tirzepatide's diverse applications beyond managing type-2 diabetes and obesity, as fat accumulation around the neck contributes to throat muscle laxity causing OSA.
It also marks the first drug treatment option for certain patients with obstructive sleep apnoea.
What’s in today’s article?
How Zepbound Works?
Types of Sleep Apnoea
:
Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA):
The most common form, caused by physical blockage of the airway.
Central Sleep Apnoea
: Occurs when the brain fails to send proper signals to muscles controlling breathing.
Complex Sleep Apnoea Syndrome
: A combination of OSA and central sleep apnoea.
About OSA
It is a sleep disorder characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep due to the relaxation of throat muscles.
These interruptions, or apneas, can lead to a choking sensation, causing the person to wake up briefly and disrupt sleep quality.
As a result, individuals with OSA often feel fatigued during the day despite having a full night’s sleep.
Link Between Obesity and OSA
As per the experts, smaller lungs due to abdominal fat and a floppy tongue are key contributors to OSA, emphasizing obesity as a significant risk factor.
Impact of Fat Accumulation
Fat around the abdomen reduces lung size, increasing the risk of airway blockage.
Neck fat and fat deposits on the back of the tongue can obstruct airways during sleep.
Prevalence
: Over 50% of OSA patients are obese, and 25% are overweight.
Other risk factors
Other risk factors include aging, smoking, and a family history of sleep apnoea.
Symptoms of OSA include loud snoring, frequent waking during the night, and excessive daytime sleepiness.
Current Treatment for OSA
Patients with OSA commonly use a positive airway pressure machine, which delivers pressurized air to keep the airway open during sleep.
Medications may also be prescribed to improve sleep quality.
Weight loss, lifestyle changes, and medications may also be recommended.
However, no drug has been available specifically for treating OSA until now.
Zepbound activates the receptors of hormones secreted by the intestine, such as
glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1)
glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)
, which reduces appetite and food intake.
Manufactured by Eli Lilly and Co., Zepbound is approved for individuals who are obese or overweight with related health conditions like type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure.
Studies suggest that by reducing body weight, Zepbound also improves OSA.
Experts noted that excess body fat contributes to diseases like OSA.
Zepbound's weight-loss properties are being linked to benefits in multiple conditions, with additional mechanisms under study.

**********PM lays foundation stone of Ken-Betwa project
Why in news?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Ken-Betwa river-linking project in Madhya Pradesh’s Khajuraho.  The project aims to transfer excess water from the Ken River in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa River. It is expected to bring prosperity to the Bundelkhand region.
What’s in today’s article?
Ken-Betwa Link Project (KBLP)
Environmental and social concerns
Controversies and Criticism Surrounding the Project
About
It aims to transfer water from the
Ken River to the Betwa River
, both
tributaries of the Yamuna
The project includes a 221-km canal with a 2-km tunnel.
The project also includes a 73.8-meter-high dam on Ken at Daudhan in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhattarpur district.
History of the Ken-Betwa interlinking project
The project was conceptualised in the 1980s but the water-sharing agreement could not be reached between the two states.
The work on the project was originally slated to begin in 2015 but only got a fresh push last year with the government making a revised deal with the two states.
Finally, On March 22, 2021, a memorandum of agreement was signed among the Ministry of Jal Shakti and the governments of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh to implement the Project.
Project Phases
Phase-I:
Construction of the
Daudhan Dam complex
, Low Level Tunnel, High Level Tunnel, Ken-Betwa Link Canal, and powerhouses.
Phase-II:
Construction of Lower Orr Dam, Bina Complex Project, and Kotha Barrage.
Completion of project
According to the Jal Shakti Ministry, the KBLP project is proposed to be implemented in eight years.
Regions Benefiting from the project
The project will benefit the Bundelkhand region, which spans 13 districts in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Key beneficiary districts include:
Madhya Pradesh:
Panna, Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Sagar, Damoh, Datia, Vidisha, Shivpuri, and Raisen.
Uttar Pradesh:
Banda, Mahoba, Jhansi, and Lalitpur.
The project aims to address water scarcity in this drought-prone region, fostering development and paving the way for future river interlinking initiatives.
Benefits of the Project
Irrigation:
Annual irrigation for 10.62 lakh hectares (8.11 lakh ha in Madhya Pradesh and 2.51 lakh ha in Uttar Pradesh).
Drinking Water:
Supply for ~62 lakh people.
Power Generation:
103 MW of hydropower and 27 MW of solar power.
Environmental Impacts
Deforestation in Panna National Park:
The project will result in large-scale deforestation, with around 98 sq km of the park submerged and 2–3 million trees felled.
Threat to Wildlife:
Tigers:
The Daudhan Dam, located inside the Panna National Park, could undermine the successful tiger reintroduction program that revived the population after local extinction in 2009.
Gharials and Vultures:
Likely to affect the Gharial population in the Ken Gharial Sanctuary and disrupt vulture nesting sites downstream.
Hydrological Concerns:
IIT-Bombay scientists warn the project could reduce September rainfall by up to 12% due to disruptions in land-atmosphere feedback.
Experts demand transparency in Ken River's hydrological data for a thorough review.
Social Impacts
Displacement:
The dam will displace 5,228 families in Chhatarpur district and 1,400 families in Panna district due to submergence and land acquisition.
Inadequate Compensation:
Protests have erupted over perceived inadequate compensation and minimal benefits for affected communities, particularly in Panna district.
Wildlife and Environmental Clearance:
The Supreme Court’s Central Empowered Committee (CEC) questioned the wildlife clearance and the project's economic viability.
Violation of Precedents:
The Union Environment Ministry approved construction within the core of the Panna Tiger Reserve, despite no precedent for such heavy infrastructure in national parks or tiger reserves.

Uniform Civil Code (UCC):
Uttarakhand’s UCC, effective January 2025, mandates registration of live-in relationships and introduces penalties for non-compliance.
Similar codes in BJP-ruled states face scrutiny for encroaching on personal freedoms.
Sub-classification of Scheduled Castes:
States can now create sub-quotas within Scheduled Caste reservations, potentially reshaping affirmative action policies.
Conclusion:
2024 underscored the Supreme Court's evolving role in addressing critical legal and social issues.
With high-stakes cases and legislative reforms on the horizon, 2025 promises to be another pivotal year for India’s judiciary.
The challenge lies in balancing judicial intervention
with respect for legislative intent, ensuring justice and constitutional values prevail.

**********MoSPI modifying CPI base year
Why in the News?
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is modifying the Consumer Price Index (CPI) base year by updating CPI weights and baskets.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About CPI (Meaning, Components, Types, Calculation Method, Purpose, etc.)
Changes in CPI (Proposal, Rational Behind Changes, Implications, etc.)
Consumer Price Index (CPI):
The CPI measures the average change in prices of a fixed basket of goods and services that households typically consume.
It reflects how the purchasing power of money changes over time due to inflation.
: CPI includes various categories, such as:
Food and Beverages
: Items like cereals, pulses, vegetables, milk, meat, and beverages.
Housing
: Rent or imputed rent for self-occupied houses.
Clothing and Footwear
: Costs of garments, footwear, and other related items.
Fuel and Light
: Includes LPG, kerosene, firewood, and electricity.
Miscellaneous
: Education, healthcare, transport, communication, and recreation expenses.
Publishing Authority
: The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for compiling and releasing CPI data.
Types of CPI:
CPI for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW)
Tracks price changes for industrial workers.
Base Year:
2016
Used for wage adjustments in organized labor.
CPI for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL) and Rural Labourers (CPI-RL)
Measures inflation for rural and agricultural laborers.
1986-87
CPI (Urban), CPI (Rural), and CPI Combined
Measures retail inflation at a national level.
2012
is widely used as the official retail inflation rate in India.
How CPI Is Calculated?
CPI is calculated using the following formula:
Here:
represents typical household consumption.
serves as a reference point for comparison (currently 2012, likely to be revised to 2024).
Purpose of CPI:
Tracking Inflation
: CPI helps monitor the rate at which prices are rising or falling.
Policy Formulation
: RBI uses CPI as the primary metric for inflation targeting, maintaining it at 4% ± 2%.
Wage and Pension Adjustments
: CPI is used to revise salaries and pensions, especially in government sectors.
Economic Analysis
: It provides insights into consumption trends and economic health.
Key Issues in the Current CPI:
Exclusion of Free PDS Items
Free goods distributed under the Public Distribution System are currently excluded as they do not involve direct monetary transactions.
This aligns with international practices and recommendations, such as those by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which suggest excluding non-monetary transactions from CPI.
Challenges with PDS Inclusion
Redistribution of weights for free items has occasionally caused inflation spikes.
Free items complicate inflation calculation as their inclusion may distort the measure of consumer expenditure.
Proposed Changes in the New CPI Series:
The MoSPI is revising the CPI methodology with 2024 as the new base year. Key changes under consideration include:
Inclusion of PDS Items
Reflecting free PDS items at a zero price, with future adjustments as weights change.
This could lower headline inflation figures but requires significant adjustments to the CPI calculation process.
Redistribution of Weights
Restrict redistribution to the same category (current practice).
Broader redistribution across the entire CPI basket for greater accuracy.
Stakeholder Consultation
The new CPI series is expected to roll out by the final quarter of FY26, post stakeholder consultations and technical adjustments.
MoSPI has invited inputs from experts, academicians, and the public on the proposed treatment of free PDS items, with the deadline set for January 15, 2025.
Rationale Behind the Proposed Changes:
Economic Representation
The Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) and other experts argue that excluding free PDS items undermines the true representation of market conditions.
With increased free food grain distribution during economic crises, including these items may provide a more accurate inflation measure.
Alignment with Household Expenditure
The updated CPI will derive weights from the 2022–23 Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES), ensuring the basket reflects current consumption patterns.
Methodological Challenges:
Compliance with International Norms
Global practices recommend limiting CPI to monetary transactions, complicating the inclusion of free PDS items.
Mid-Series Adjustments
Adapting ongoing CPI series to account for changes in PDS pricing—such as shifting from zero to positive prices—presents statistical challenges.
Impact on Headline Inflation
Including free items may lower inflation figures, but it risks skewing the index’s purpose of capturing monetary price movements.
Broader Implications:
Policy Decisions
The revised CPI will serve as a critical input for monetary policy, helping the RBI frame more accurate inflation-targeting measures.
Global Trade Considerations
As India aims to align its statistical practices with international standards, changes in CPI methodology may affect global investor perceptions.
Conclusion:
The ongoing deliberations on including free PDS items in CPI aim to enhance the index’s robustness and accuracy.
While aligning with international best practices, India’s revised CPI could better capture the dynamics of consumer expenditure and inflation in a rapidly evolving economic landscape.
Stakeholder feedback and meticulous planning will be crucial to navigating the statistical and policy complexities of these changes.
