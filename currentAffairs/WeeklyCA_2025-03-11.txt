PMMVY Implementation Concerns
Source: TH
Why in News?
Despite maternity benefits being a legal entitlement under the
National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013
, the
Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)
faces significant implementation challenges, leaving millions of pregnant women without essential benefits.
What is PMMVY and its Concerns?
PMMVY:
The
Centrally Sponsored
scheme launched in 2017 under the
Ministry of Women and Child Development,
provides maternity benefits to eligible pregnant and lactating women.
However, government employees and those receiving similar benefits are not eligible.
Objectives:
PMMVY ensures maternal nutrition, promotes institutional deliveries, supports financial stability, and encourages the birth of girl children.
Key Features
: Provides
financial assistance
to support maternal health and nutrition.
First child:
Rs 5,000 is provided, and additional benefits under
Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)
ensure that women receive around
Rs 6,000
in total.
Second child (only if a girl):
Rs 6,000 is given to promote
gender equality
and discourage
female feticide
Concerns:
Restricted Coverage
: The scheme violates the
NFSA, 2013
, which mandates universal maternity benefits, by limiting benefits to only the
first two children
, with the second child covered only if it is a
Budget Cuts
: In
2023-24, the central government allocated just Rs 870 crore
for the scheme, only one-third of what was allocated in 2019-20.
Covering
90% of births
at Rs 6,000 each would require at least
Rs 12,000 crore
Poor Implementation
: The scheme’s effective coverage dropped from
36% in 2019-20 to just 9% in 2023-24.
Bureaucratic and Digital Hurdles
: The scheme is plagued by
Aadhaar
-based verification issues
, complex application processes and frequent software failures, making it difficult for
poor and digitally illiterate women
to access benefits.
What are the Provisions for Maternity Benefits Under NFSA?
NFSA 2013:
Aims to provide
food and nutritional security
by ensuring access to affordable food grains for a large section of India's population.
The Act marks a shift from
welfare-based to rights-based food security,
making the
Public Distribution System (PDS
more structured and legally binding.
Maternity Benefits Under the NFSA, 2013
: All pregnant women (except those in the formal sector) are entitled to
Rs 6,000 per child
as maternity benefits.
Maternity benefits
help ensure
proper nutrition, healthcare, and rest
for pregnant women, which is crucial for maternal and child health.
Way Forward
Grassroots Implementation:
Involve
Accredited Social Health Activists
Anganwadi workers
Panchayati Raj institutions
to identify and assist eligible beneficiaries.
Extend benefits to
low-income workers in the informal economy
, as many are outside the scope of
paid maternity leave.
Extend benefits to all pregnant women, as mandated by the NFSA  instead of restricting it to the first child and second child.
Holistic Approach:
Ensure better linkage with JSY,
POSHAN Abhiyaan
, and state maternity schemes (state models like Tamil Nadu and Odisha) to provide comprehensive maternal care.
Combine cash transfers with
free nutrition kits,
antenatal care
postpartum support
for better maternal and child health outcomes.
Monitoring:
Conduct regular independent audits to evaluate fund utilization and beneficiary reach.
Remove Digital Hurdles:
Introduce
alternative identity verification
to prevent exclusion due to Aadhaar-related issues.
Ensure payments are credited without delays by
integrating with Jan Dhan accounts
removing unnecessary bureaucratic approvals
Drishti Mains Question:
How does the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana contradict the provisions of the National Food Security Act, 2013? Suggest measures to align the scheme with NFSA.
