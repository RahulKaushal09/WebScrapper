**********What is the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)?
The Union Finance Ministry recently notified operationalisation of the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) as an option under the National Pension System (NPS) for central government employees.
About Unified Pension Scheme (UPS):
UPS will apply to
Central Government employees
who are
covered under the National Pension System (NPS) and who choose this option
under the NPS.
Both current and future Central Government employees covered under the NPS have the option to choose between the UPS or continue with the existing NPS plan.
Once a decision is made
to switch to the UPS, it is considered
final and binding.
Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)
may issue regulations for operationalizing the UPS.
The effective date for operationalization of the Unified Pension Scheme shall be April 1, 2025.
Key Features:
UPS provides a
guaranteed payout
to employees upon superannuation.
It will
offer 50% of the average basic pay drawn
by a Central government employee during the 12 months prior to retirement, provided
they complete 25 years of service.
Employees with less than 25 years
but more than 10 years
will receive a
pension on a proportionate basis.
minimum payout of Rs 10,000 per month
is assured for
employees with 10
or more
years of qualifying service.
For those who choose to retire voluntarily after 25 years of service, the payout will begin from the date they would have reached superannuation if they had continued working.
In the event of the
payout holder's death
after superannuation, a
family payout at 60% of the payout
admissible to the holder will be given
to the legally wedded spouse.
Additionally,
dearness relief
will be available o
n the assured payout and family payout
. Dearness relief will be worked out in the same manner as Dearness Allowance applicable to serving employees.
or assured payout would
not be available in case of removal or dismissal
from service
or resignation

Contributions under the UPS:
Unlike the old pension scheme, UPS is
contributory in nature
, wherein
will be required to
contribute 10 percent of their basic salary and dearness allowance while
employer's
contribution (the
central government) will be 18.5 percent.
However, the eventual
payout depends on the market returns
on that corpus, mostly invested in government debt.

**********Corpse Flower
Recently, a “corpse flower” at the Royal Botanic Gardens of Sydney has drawn more than 20,000 curious viewers to a special display for its much-anticipated opening.
About Corpse Flower:
It is the common name of
Titan arum
Scientific name:
Amorphophallus titanium
It is native to the
Sumatra Island
, Indonesia and gets its name from the literal translation of the Indonesian phrase
Bunga bangkai
Features:
Some corpse flowers have been known to grow 3 meters tall before revealing a phallic spadix (or spike).
The spadix of the flower emits a foul odor that smells like rotting meat to attract pollinators. Its blooms are often inconsistent.
Many flowers bloom once a decade, though sometimes more frequently.
Life Cycle:
The life cycle depends on the time it takes for the “corm” of the flower to gather enough energy to bloom.
When enough energy has been stored through leaf cycles, the flowering stage begins.
The bloom lasts for a day, with the spathe (the purple, petal-like structure surrounding the spadix) taking hours to fully unfurl.
These flowers have
both male and female flowers
. Female flowers open first to prevent a plant from pollinating itself. Nearby flowers are required to bloom at similar times in order for cross-pollination to be possible.
Insects attracted to the odor are ones that lay their eggs in decaying meat, but they have the benefit of moving pollen between male and female flowers to trigger the flower’s reproductive cycle.
Chemicals emitted during female flowering are:
Dimethyl disulfide, Dimethyl trisulfide, 3-Methylbutanal, Methanethiol, Methyl thioacetate
Isovaleric acid.
It is categorized as
Endangered
by the IUCN.

Recently, a 24-year old woman was awarded the death sentence by a Thiruvananthapuram court which found her guilty of poisoning her boyfriend in 2022 with a chemical herbicide called paraquat.
About Paraquat:
Also known as
paraquat dichloride or methyl viologen
, it is one of the world’s most-used herbicides.
It is primarily used to control the growth of weeds and desiccate crops like
cotton
before harvest.
The
WHO classifies
paraquat as
Category 2
(moderately hazardous and moderately irritating) chemical.
Its sale is banned in over 70 countries, including China and the European Union, due to its potent toxicity. It is widely used in
the US and in India.
Mode:
Ingestion
is the most common route of exposure.
It may also be transferred and absorbed through
prolonged skin contact
Symptoms:
It depends on the amount, means and length of exposure to the chemical.
If ingested in a small amount, a person would display signs of
damage to the heart, kidneys, liver and lungs
over several days or weeks.
If ingested in large amount then the person could face
acute kidney failure, rapid heart rate
failure of the heart and liver
seizures
respiratory failure
The person would immediately display
abdominal pain
swelling and pain in the mouth and throat
bloody diarrhoea
nausea
Treatments:
There are no known antidotes for paraquat poisoning but some studies mentions that
immunosuppression
Charcoal Hemoperfusion (CHP)
can be used.

**********Should Governors Be Chancellors of State Universities?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Historical Context (Governor’s Role, Origin, Power, etc.)
Current System (Challenges, Insights from Commissions, Reform Models, etc.)
Historical Context of the Governor’s Role:
The role of Governors as Chancellors of State universities in India traces its roots to colonial-era policies.
Introduced in 1857 with the establishment of universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras
, this model aimed to maintain British control over educational institutions.
Post-independence, the system was retained without reconsideration of its relevance in a democratic and federal context.
Governors, in their capacity as Chancellors, wield significant authority over universities, including appointing Vice-Chancellors, nominating syndicate members, and approving university statutes.
However, this role has often led to conflicts, especially in states governed by opposition parties.
Challenges of the Current System:
Politicization of the Role
From the late 1960s, Governors transitioned from neutral figures to politically influenced appointees.
Studies reveal that
52% of Governors between 1950 and 2015 were active politicians
, undermining the credibility of the position.
Conflicting Authorities
The dual accountability of universities to both state governments and Governors has led to governance challenges, including delays in appointments and decision-making.
Lack of Expertise
Many Governors
lack the academic qualifications
necessary to guide universities effectively.
This gap often results in non-transparent decisions and political interference.
Erosion of Federal Principles
Allowing centrally appointed Governors to control state-funded institutions dilutes federalism, reducing universities’ accountability to state governments.
Insights from Commissions and Alternatives:
Several commissions have highlighted the limitations of the Governor’s role:
Sarkaria Commission (1983-88)
: Recognized the Governor’s statutory role but recommended consultations with Chief Ministers in university matters.
M. M. Punchhi Commission (2007-10)
: Advocated for separating the Governor’s constitutional and statutory roles, suggesting that states appoint eminent academicians as Chancellors.
Reform Models:
Ceremonial Role
: States like Gujarat, Karnataka, and Maharashtra have redefined the Governor’s role to a ceremonial one, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers.
State-Appointed Chancellors
: Telangana and Kerala propose appointing distinguished academicians or public figures as Chancellors, but such reforms face delays in Presidential assent.
University-Elected Chancellors
: Global practices, like those in Oxford and Melbourne, allow university bodies to elect Chancellors, ensuring autonomy and accountability.
Need for Progressive Reforms:
The colonial legacy of Governors as Chancellors must be dismantled to ensure university autonomy, foster academic excellence, and minimize political interference.
Reforming university governance aligns with global best practices and reinforces India’s federal structure.
States like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal await Presidential assent for their reform Bills, highlighting the need for equitable and timely decision-making at the national level.
Conclusion:
Reforming the role of Governors as Chancellors is essential for fostering transparent, accountable, and autonomous university governance.
By adopting models that prioritize academic independence and minimize political entanglements, India can create an educational framework aligned with democratic principles and global standards.

**********Genocide and the World’s Averted Gaze
Context
Eighty years ago, on January 27, 1945
, Soviet soldiers liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau, encountering
a horrific scene of emaciated prisoners and remnants of systematic murder.
Among the haunting artifacts were 44,000 pairs of shoes and mounds of spectacles
, silent witnesses to the atrocities committed against
~1.1 million people, predominantly European Jews.
This
tragic moment in history epitomised the devastating consequences of hatred and indifference,
compelling the world to collectively vow
‘never again’
to the horrors of genocide.
Yet, as history has painfully demonstrated,
this promise remains unfulfilled, and the shadows of such atrocities continue to loom over humanity.
The Crime of Genocide: An Enduring Stain
1948 Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed with the intent to destroy
, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.
definition underscores the systematic nature of such crimes,
rooted in prejudice and power.
Holocaust, with its meticulous Nazi codification of Jewish persecution beginning in 1933, culminated in the industrialised killing of six million Jews
alongside countless Roma, Sinti, political dissidents, and others deemed inferior.
While the
Allies were not fully aware of the extent of this horror,
the Nuremberg Laws, the Kristallnacht pogroms, and accounts from Jewish refugees foreshadowed the genocide to come.
Tragically, bureaucratic barriers, xenophobia, and antisemitism hindered timely intervention
, leaving millions to face annihilation.
The Reality of ‘Never Again’
The Cambodian Genocide (1975–1979)
One of the most harrowing examples of the world’s failure occurred
during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia.
Pol Pot and his government pursued a radical vision of agrarian communism
, systematically
targeting intellectuals, professionals, religious groups
, and ethnic minorities.
Over
two million people perished due to executions, forced labour, starvation, and disease
The genocide unfolded while
global powers prioritised Cold War allegiances over humanitarian concerns.
China and the West supported the Khmer Rouge
to counter Vietnam and its Soviet-aligned government, even after Vietnam intervened and ousted Pol Pot in 1979.
International condemnation was overshadowed by political calculations
, leaving millions of victims to suffer in silence.
The Rwandan Genocide (1994)
In Rwanda, the genocide unfolded at a staggering pace, with
nearly one million people, mostly minority Tutsi and moderate Hutu, slaughtered within 100 days.
world watched in horror but failed to act.
The United Nations peacekeepers in Rwanda, under-resourced and constrained by strict mandates, were powerless to stop the violence.
Despite clear warning signs
, including hate propaganda disseminated by Rwandan radio stations and the stockpiling of weapons,
the global community delayed its response.
When help did arrive, it was too little, too late.
Rwanda stands as a grim reminder of how bureaucratic inertia, lack of political will,
and international indifference
can result in catastrophic consequences.
The Srebrenica Massacre (1995)
Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia further exemplifies the world’s failure
to prevent genocide.
Declared a UN safe zone during the Bosnian Wa
r, Srebrenica became a
symbol of false security.
In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces overran the enclave, separating men and boys
from women and children.
Over 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were systematically executed
in what became Europe’s worst atrocity since World War II.
UN peacekeepers, under Dutch command, were unable to prevent the massacre,
as requests for reinforcements from NATO and the UN went unanswered.
tragedy was not merely a failure of protection but also of recognition
, as the global community grappled with
how to respond to ethnic cleansing within Europe.
The Darfur Genocide (2003–2005)
In Darfur, Sudan, another genocide unfolded under the world’s gaze.
Sudanese government, in collaboration with Janjaweed militias, targeted non-Arab ethnic groups
through systematic killings, displacement, and sexual violence.
By the time the international community acknowledged
the scale of the atrocities,
over 200,000 people had been killed, and millions were displaced.
While the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Sudanese leaders, including President Omar al-Bashir,
geopolitical interests and diplomatic inertia limited the enforcement of justice.
Today,
violence continues to plague Sudan
, with fears of renewed genocide as global attention shifts elsewhere.
Gaza: A Contemporary Crisis
The ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza adds another layer to this grim narrative.
As the world commemorates the liberation of Auschwitz,
Gazans sift through rubble, searching for loved ones among the estimated 10,000 missing.
International Criminal Court (ICC) is investigating allegations of genocide
, with arrest warrants issued for both Israeli and Hamas leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
However,
the international response reflects a troubling inconsistency
. While the United States and Western Europe condemn the ICC’s actions
, a hierarchy of suffering appears to dictate their reactions.
Arms continue to flow to Israel, even as Gaza suffers staggering devastation
: over 47,000 deaths, predominantly women and children, widespread destruction of homes, healthcare, and schools, and the displacement of entire populations.
Gaza’s plight forces the global community to confront uncomfortable questions
about the boundaries between self-defence and genocide, and the moral cost of inaction.
A Path Forward: Lessons from the Past
UN Secretary-General, aptly noted in 2020 that genocide is always preceded by clear warning signs.
these warnings are often ignored or dismissed,
enabling perpetrators to act with impunity.
To honour the victims of past and present genocides,
the world must transcend geopolitical interests and embrace a genuine commitment to justice and prevention.
This includes strengthening international institutions, ensuring accountability for crimes against humanity,
and addressing the systemic inequalities and prejudices that fuel such violence.
Conclusion
liberation of Auschwitz serves as a stark reminder of the depths of human cruelty
and the resilience of the human spirit.
The recurring failures to prevent genocide
, from Auschwitz to Gaza,
expose deep flaws in humanity’s collective conscience.
As we reflect on this dark chapter,
let it inspire a renewed resolve to uphold the promise of ‘never again’, not as an empty refrain, but as a guiding principle
for a more just and compassionate world.

**********An Enduring Commitment to the Indo-Pacific
Context
The
inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th President
of the United States marks an extraordinary political comeback,
reshaping American politics and signalling a critical moment in global geopolitics.
Central to the vision of Trump’s administration is the Indo-Pacific region
, which plays a vital role in shaping global trade, security, and stability.
Therefore,
it is crucial to explore the Indo-Pacific's growing significance, analyses the evolution of U.S. policy, and outlines the potential trajectory of Trump’s approach
to the region.
The Indo-Pacific Region Under Trump’s First Term: Redefining the Indo-Pacific
A New Geopolitical Lens
Trump’s administration popularised the term ‘Indo-Pacific,’
moving beyond the narrower Asia-Pacific framework to encompass a broader geographical and strategic focus.
This
semantic shift underscored the significance of the Indian Ocean alongside East Asia,
reflecting Washington’s commitment to countering China's growing influence in both maritime and terrestrial spheres.
Indo-Pacific narrative emphasised securing vital sea lines of communication, addressing maritime security challenges
, and maintaining a balance of power in a region central to global trade and security.
Institutional and Structural Reforms
Significant structural adjustments further cemented the region's importance
in U.S. strategic thinking.
renaming of the U.S. Pacific Command to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in 2018 symbolised the operational prioritisation
of the region.
Moreover,
the Office of the Secretary of Defence reorganised its framework to establish specialised units focusing on partnerships with Indo-Pacific allies
, signalling a long-term commitment to safeguarding regional stability.
Revival of the Quad
Perhaps most crucially,
the Trump administration revitalised the Quad,
elevating it from an informal dialogue to a ministerial-level engagement.
reflected a pragmatic convergence of interests among the United States, India, Japan, and Australia
in countering shared challenges, including China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and the need for resilient supply chains.
Maritime security, technological cooperation, and standards-setting became focal points of the Quad
, laying the groundwork for deeper collaboration in maintaining a rules-based order.
Indo-Pacific Under Biden
Continuity with a Broader Agenda
Biden administration inherited Trump’s Indo-Pacific framework
, maintaining its strategic centrality while expanding its scope.
Biden elevated the Quad further by organising the first Quad leaders’ summit in 2021,
broadening its focus beyond defence to include pressing global challenges like vaccine distribution, climate change, and critical infrastructure development.
This approach reflected a blend of hard and soft power,
emphasising multilateralism and inclusive development to strengthen the Indo-Pacific's stability and prosperity.
Introduction of Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)
Biden also introduced the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) in 2022
to complement strategic priorities with economic engagement.
These efforts underlined a bipartisan consensus in Washington
on the Indo-Pacific's critical role, providing a solid foundation for Trump’s second term to build upon.
Potential Trajectory of Trump’s Approach to the Indo-Pacific Region
Countering China’s Assertiveness
administration views China not only as a regional competitor but also as a global adversary
with ambitions to challenge the U.S.-led world order.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s remarks, describing China as the most formidable adversary,
underscore the administration’s commitment to adopting a more confrontational stance.
may involve increased freedom-of-navigation operations in contested areas like the South China Sea,
expanded sanctions against Chinese entities, and intensified efforts to counter Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative by offering alternative development projects to nations in the region.
The U.S. is expected to lead a coalition of like-minded countries to deter coercive actions by China,
particularly those that seek to alter the status quo through force or intimidation.
Strengthening the Quad as a Pillar of Regional Stability
The Quad
remains a cornerstone of Trump’s Indo-Pacific strategy
grouping of the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia is seen as a vital mechanism
for promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific.
Trump’s administration will
likely prioritise making the Quad more operational
, with an emphasis on joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and coordinated responses to maritime security challenges.
The revival of the Quad during Trump’s first term was a reflection of its strategic necessity,
and his administration is poised to take it further.
Regular ministerial and leaders’ summits, such as the one planned to be hosted by India, will focus on institutionalising the Quad into a more robust platform
for addressing regional challenges.
Advancing Defence Cooperation
central feature of Trump’s Indo-Pacific strategy will be deepening defence ties
with key regional allies and partners.
to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command during Trump’s first term
was symbolic of this commitment.
In his second term, Trump is likely to accelerate efforts to build the defence capacities of allies like India, Japan, and Australia
through technology transfers, joint exercises, and co-production agreements.
Trump’s administration may also expand trilateral or multilateral defence initiatives
beyond the Quad.
For instance,
enhancing military collaboration with Southeast Asian nations such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia could serve to reinforce regional deterrence
against China.
Promoting Economic and Technological Alliances
While hard power will dominate Trump’s Indo-Pacific strategy,
economic and technological collaboration will remain critical components of his approach.
Recognising the importance of economic security
in maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific,
Trump’s administration is likely to promote resilient supply chains
that reduce dependency on China.
could involve strengthening initiatives to diversify production networks
, particularly in key sectors like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and critical minerals.
Furthermore,
technological partnerships with Indo-Pacific allies are expected to gain prominence.
U.S. may spearhead initiatives to develop and deploy 5G networks, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies,
ensuring that these innovations align with democratic values and standards.
Balancing Hard Power with Broader Agendas
While the focus on hard power will be a defining feature of Trump’s second term,
the administration is also likely to support broader initiatives that align with U.S. strategic interests.
For example,
efforts to address climate change, enhance vaccine distribution, and promote infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific
could serve as complementary strategies to reinforce regional stability.
These initiatives,
however, will likely be pursued through bilateral or multilateral frameworks that prioritise U.S. leadership
and align with the broader objective of countering China’s influence.
Conclusion
Donald Trump’s second term as President heralds a renewed focus on the Indo-Pacific
, reaffirming its centrality to U.S. foreign policy and global geopolitics.
By building on the foundational work of his first term and leveraging bipartisan consensus,
Trump’s administration is poised to adopt a more assertive posture against China while creating deeper collaboration with Quad partners.
As the Indo-Pacific continues to shape the geopolitical dynamics of the 21st century,
the U.S.'s role under Trump 2.0 will be critical in navigating this complex and evolving landscape.

) awards, highlighting the need to avoid such policies.
The GST System - Challenges and Flaws:
Revenue maximization over growth:
The GST Council’s narrow focus on revenue collection leads to:
High tax rates suppressing demand and growth.
Complex exemptions, circulars, and show-cause notices.
A lack of a fair appellate system.
Input tax credit issues:
Denial of input tax credit for essential sectors (e.g., real estate) creates economic inefficiencies.
High tax burden:
Excessive GST on lease rentals, affordable housing, and infrastructure hampers economic progress.
Economic Impacts of High Tax Rates:
Consumption and competition:
High taxes
reduce consumption
, while lower rates could boost demand and tax revenues.
Simplified and competitive tax rates could help Indian businesses compete with Chinese imports.
Sectoral challenges:
Real estate:
Multiple taxes increase costs, contradicting affordable housing goals.
Cement:
A uniform 18% GST could lower infrastructure costs.
Hospitality:
Standardizing GST rates for hotels and restaurants can drive growth.
The Slide back to old practices:
India’s tax system (1950-1990) prioritized revenue over growth, leading to economic stagnation.
Signs of a return to these practices are evident in:
Rising imports from China
($70 billion in 2018-19 to $100 billion in 2023-24).
Declining manufacturing sector contribution to GDP (<15%).
Continued depreciation of the rupee.
A New Policy Framework for Growth:
Reforms 2.0:
After 1991, it’s time for the Reforms 2.0.
India needs to
prioritize growth maximization
, with taxes as a byproduct of growth.
Introduce empirical studies to evaluate tax impacts on consumption.
Simplify tax structures to encourage investment and growth.
Transition to a long-term fiscal policy (2025-2030) focused on a
9-10% annual growth rate.
Urgency for change:
The current system risks a downward spiral of low growth and high taxes, requiring immediate reforms.
Conclusion - A New Year, A New Vision:
Just as individuals resolve to improve themselves, nations must do the same. The need of the hour is
a bold fiscal overhaul
, embracing growth-focused policies and respecting the rule of law.
Without reform, India risks stifling its potential; with it, a brighter economic future is within reach.
The GST Council and, indeed, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) must now adopt a new policy framework that focuses on growth maximisation.

Editorial Analysis
**********Understanding the Whip System
Why in news?
Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar criticized the party whip system, stating it restricts MPs' freedom of expression and enforces servility by compelling them to follow the party line.
Speaking to students recently, he questioned the necessity of whips, arguing that they prevent representatives from using independent judgment.
The whip system is perceived as crucial for ensuring party discipline, particularly during significant votes in Parliament, with penalties like expulsion for non-compliance.
What’s in today’s article?
Introduction to the Whip System in India
Types of Whips
Key Roles in the Whip System
Significance of the Whip System
About Whip System
The term "whip" originates from England's hunting fields, where a whipper-in was tasked with keeping stray hounds within the pack.
Introduction to Politics
The political use of the term is credited to Edmund Burke, an Anglo-Irish politician and philosopher.
In a speech in the House of Commons, he described how the King’s ministers rallied their supporters, referring to it as “whipping them in.”
The whip system in India dates back to the beginning of its parliamentary history and plays a crucial role in maintaining party discipline, particularly during important votes.
Legal and Democratic Context
The Anti-Defection Law, enacted in 1985, enforces compliance with the whip system to preserve the integrity of political parties in India’s parliamentary democracy.
While some view the system as restrictive,
even the Supreme Court has upheld its necessity for maintaining party discipline and stability in governance
Purpose of the Whip System
Parties see voting on key issues as central to their political identity and expect MPs to align with the party line.
Non-compliance or absence during critical votes can cause significant embarrassment.
Significance During Division Voting
For ruling parties or coalitions, unanimous attendance and compliance during division votes are vital to showcase their majority strength. Failure to do so could lead to a no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha.
Role of the Party Whip
The party chief whip acts as the liaison between the leadership and MPs, communicating the party's stance on critical matters, ensuring attendance during votes, and coordinating which members speak on specific issues in Parliament.
One-Line Whip
: Informs members about a vote but allows them to abstain.
Two-Line Whip
: Requires members to be present but does not dictate how to vote.
Three-Line Whip
: The strictest directive, instructing members to be present and vote as per the party line.
Significance of the Three-Line Whip
The three-line whip, typically issued by the party’s chief whip, mandates strict adherence.
Violation can lead to disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law, as recommended by the party leader to the House's Presiding Officer.
The chief whip of a political party holds the most crucial role in enforcing the whip system, supported by additional whips within the party.
Government’s Chief Whip
In the
, the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs acts as the government’s chief whip, coordinating with ruling alliance leaders to issue a three-line whip.
Rajya Sabha,
the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs serves as the government’s chief whip.
Consequences of Violating a Whip
If a member of the ruling alliance defies the chief whip’s directive, the party leader can recommend the member’s disqualification to the Presiding Officer.
For members, compliance with their party whip’s directions remains paramount.
The whip system ensures discipline and coherence within political parties, crucial for the functioning of Parliamentary democracy.
According to experts, the outcome of a single vote in Parliament can determine the fate of legislation or even the Council of Ministers.
Role in Parliamentary Democracy
Former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan emphasized that MPs elected on a party ticket represent the party’s ideology and policies.
While internal disagreements can be voiced within party forums, compliance with the party’s final decision is necessary, ensuring accountability and unity.
Platform for Exchange: All-India Whips Conference
Since 1952, the All-India Whips Conference is organized by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.
The Conference has provided a platform for whips from all political parties, both ruling and Opposition, to share views and strategies, promoting better coordination in Parliamentary processes

**********Geo-tagging of chinar trees in J&K
Why in news?
The Jammu & Kashmir government has launched the
“Tree Aadhaar”
mission to conserve the region’s declining chinar trees.
The initiative includes conducting a census of chinar trees and assigning each tree a unique identity to monitor and protect them effectively.
What’s in today’s article?
Chinar Tree
Importance of Chinar in Kashmir
Chinar Conservation Project Overview
About Chinar Tree (Oriental plane tree)
Characteristics:
Maple-like tree with a vast canopy.
Found in cool climates with sufficient water, mainly in the Eastern Himalayas.
Grows up to 30 metres tall with a girth of 10-15 metres.
Takes 30-50 years to mature and 150 years to reach full size.
Origin of the Name 'Chinar'
Coined by the Mughals, possibly by Emperor Jahangir.
Derived from the Persian phrase “Che naar ast” meaning “What flame is that?” – inspired by the crimson red leaves in autumn.
Mughal Influence on Chinar Plantations
Role:
Mughals expanded chinar plantations in Kashmir and parts of Jammu’s Chenab region.
Symbol:
Considered a “royal tree.”
Notable Contributions by Jahangir:
Created
Naseem Bagh
on Dal Lake’s banks with over 1,100 chinar trees.
Planted chinars on a small Dal Lake island, now known as
Chaar Chinari
(Four Chinars).
State Tree
The chinar is the "state tree" of Jammu & Kashmir (now a Union Territory).
Tourist Attraction
The chinar becomes a major attraction in autumn when its leaves turn crimson red and golden.
Cultural and Artistic Significance:
Chinar motifs are commonly seen in local
papier mache
embroidery
hand-woven carpets
, and
walnut wood carvings
The tree holds a special place in the art, literature, and craft traditions of Kashmir.
Religious Significance:
Chinar trees are found near many
Muslim and Hindu shrines
in the region.
Oldest Chinar Tree:
oldest surviving chinar
(around 700 years old) is located in
Chattergam village

**********[27th January 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Genocide and the world’s averted gaze
International Relations
PYQ Relevance:
) To what extend can Germany be held responsible for causing the two World Wars? Discuss critically.
(UPSC CSE 2015)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC Mains has always focused on
World Wars (2015)
India’s relations with Israel
(2018).
On January 27, 1945, Soviet soldiers liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau
(network of Nazi concentration and extermination camps)
, finding 8,000 starving prisoners and remnants of the 1.1 million, mostly Jewish, who perished there. With Nazi records destroyed, exact figures are uncertain. On this anniversary, survivors and world leaders gather to honor the victims and renew the commitment to prevent genocide.
Today’s editorial  talks about Genocide in the world and laws related to Genocide. It will help in GS Paper 2 Internqtional relation and GS Paper 1 World History.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
World leaders will gather in Poland to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day and the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, a Nazi concentration camp.
What is Holocaust?
The Holocaust, known in Hebrew as the Shoah , refers to the systematic,
state-sponsored genocide
of approximately
six million Jews
by
Nazi Germany
and its collaborators during World War II, primarily between 1941 and 1945.
This atrocity was characterized by mass murders carried out through various means, including mass shootings and the use of extermination camps, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka.
What is Constitutes Genocide?
Genocide is defined under international law as a series of acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group. This definition is codified in
Article II
1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention).
How is it Recognized Internationally?
Legal Frameworks:
The 1948 Genocide Convention defines genocide and obligates signatory states to prevent and punish the crime. This convention has been incorporated into the statutes of various international tribunals, including the International Criminal Court (ICC), establishing a legal basis for prosecution and accountability for genocidal acts.
International Courts and Tribunals:
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) and other tribunals have jurisdiction to adjudicate cases related to genocide.
They interpret and enforce the provisions of the Genocide Convention, allowing for legal proceedings against individuals or states accused of committing genocide.
Recognition by States and Organizations:
Various countries and international organizations have formally recognized specific events as genocides, which can influence diplomatic relations and international responses.
For example, numerous nations have acknowledged the Armenian Genocide, while the European Parliament has recognized the actions of ISIS against Yazidis as genocide.
Why do global powers often remain silent or inactive in the face of genocidal acts?
Geopolitical and Strategic Interests:
Global powers often prioritize alliances and regional influence over humanitarian intervention.
For example:
Rwanda Genocide (1994):
Despite clear warnings, the UN and major powers failed to act decisively as Rwanda was not strategically significant to their interests, leading to the massacre of over 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
Economic Dependencies and Trade Priorities:
Economic ties, such as energy or trade partnerships, often deter powers from addressing genocidal acts.
China’s Treatment of Uyghur Muslims:
Countries like the U.S. and EU hesitate to impose strong measures against China due to its role as a major trading partner, despite widespread reports of atrocities in Xinjiang.
International Bureaucratic Deadlock:
Global institutions like the UN are often hindered by vetoes and a lack of consensus among major powers.
Syrian Civil War:
Allegations of genocide and mass atrocities in Syria were met with inaction, as Russia and China vetoed resolutions in the UN Security Council, paralyzing international intervention.
What responsibilities do nations have to prevent and respond to genocide?
Primary Responsibility to Protect:
States have the primary obligation to protect their own populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.
This responsibility is affirmed by the 2005 United Nations World Summit Outcome, which emphasizes that national governments must take proactive measures to prevent such atrocities within their territories.
International Cooperation and Support:
The international community is obligated to assist states in fulfilling their protective responsibilities. This includes providing diplomatic, humanitarian, and other peaceful means to help protect populations at risk of genocide. If a state is manifestly failing to protect its citizens, the international community must be prepared to take collective action, including potential military intervention, in accordance with the UN Charter.
Early Warning Systems and Preventive Measures:
Nations and international organizations should establish early warning systems to identify signs of potential genocidal acts. This involves gathering information, promoting human rights, addressing root causes of conflict, and implementing strategies that foster social cohesion and prevent discrimination.
Way forward:
Strengthen International Accountability Mechanisms
: Nations must collaborate to reinforce the effectiveness of international courts and tribunals to ensure swift and impartial prosecution of genocidal acts. This includes reforming veto power in the UN Security Council to prevent deadlocks in responding to atrocities.
Invest in Prevention and Early Intervention
: Establish robust early warning systems and prioritize diplomacy, economic aid, and social cohesion initiatives to address the root causes of conflicts, reducing the risk of genocidal acts before they escalate.
**********How has India revised obesity parameters?
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges in the Health sector;
Why in the News?
A report by The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Commission emphasized body fat distribution, beyond Body Mass Index (BMI), as a vital health and disease risk indicator. In this response, India has revised its obesity guidelines after 15 years.
What is the present status of Obesity?
Rising Obesity Rates:
The obesity rate in India has significantly increased, with approximately 9.8% of women and 5.4% of men classified as obese as of 2022, compared to just 1.2% for women and 0.5% for men in 1990
. This translates to around eight crore individuals being classified as obese, including one crore children aged 5 to 19 years
Economic Impact and Healthcare Costs:
It is projected that India will spend about $13 million annually on treating obesity-related illnesses by 2025 as per the
World Obesity Federation.
The rising prevalence of obesity is associated with various non-communicable diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular issues.
Changing Demographics:
The prevalence of obesity is expected to continue rising, with forecasts suggesting that by 2040, around 30.5% of men and 27.4% of women will be either overweight or obese.
What are the initiatives taken by the government?
National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Stroke (NPCDCS):
This program aims to screen individuals for obesity-related risk factors and ensure early intervention to prevent complications associated with obesity. It is part of the broader National Health Mission.
Eat Right India Movement:
Launched by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), this initiative focuses on transforming the food system to promote safe, healthy, and sustainable food for all citizens. It includes awareness campaigns about nutrition and healthy eating habits.
Ayushman Bharat Health Wellness Centres:
These centres strengthen preventive healthcare by promoting wellness activities and targeted communication at the community level, addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including obesity.
Regulatory Measures:
The FSSAI has set guidelines to limit trans fats in food products to no more than 2% by weight and has introduced labelling regulations that require nutritional information on food packaging, helping consumers make informed dietary choices.
What are the new guidelines?
Terminology Update:
The term “overweight” has been removed, categorizing obesity into Grade I (BMI >23 kg/m² without health issues) and Grade II (BMI >23 kg/m² with associated health limitations) to emphasize nuanced stages of obesity.
Focus on Abdominal Obesity:
Waist circumference (>90 cm for men, >80 cm for women) and waist-to-height ratio are prioritized as critical measures for assessing health risks in Asian Indians
Why has it been revised after 15 years?
Rising Prevalence of Obesity:
The prevalence of obesity in India has doubled over the past two decades, with significant increases observed in both adults and children. This alarming trend necessitated a reevaluation of existing guidelines to address the growing public health crisis effectively.
Limitations of Previous Guidelines:
The previous guidelines, established in 2009, relied solely on Body Mass Index (BMI) for diagnosing obesity.
This approach was found inadequate as it did not consider critical factors such as abdominal fat distribution and the unique metabolic responses of Asian Indians, who tend to develop obesity-related health issues at lower BMI thresholds compared to Western populations.
Global Framework Alignment:
The revised guidelines align with global recommendations from
The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology Commission,
which advocates for a broader understanding of obesity as a chronic disease rather than merely excess weight. T
What are the health issues that can develop due to obesity?
Cardiovascular Diseases:
Obesity significantly increases the risk of developing heart disease and stroke. It contributes to high blood pressure and unhealthy cholesterol levels, which are critical risk factors for cardiovascular conditions.
Type 2 Diabetes:
Excess body weight can disrupt the body’s ability to use insulin effectively, leading to insulin resistance and a higher likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. This chronic condition is closely linked to obesity and can result in severe health complications if not managed properly.
Certain Cancers:
Obesity is associated with an elevated risk of various cancers, including breast, colon, endometrial, and liver cancers. The increased body fat may influence hormone levels and inflammation, contributing to cancer development.
Way forward:
Comprehensive Public Health Strategies
: Strengthen preventive measures through awareness campaigns, promote healthy lifestyles, regulate unhealthy food products, and expand screening programs under initiatives like NPCDCS and Ayushman Bharat.
Collaborative Policy Reforms
: Enhance inter-sectoral collaboration to address urbanization, sedentary lifestyles, and dietary patterns while aligning with global obesity management frameworks for effective, long-term solutions.
Mains PYQ:
Public health system has limitations in providing universal health coverage. Do you think that private sector can help in bridging the gap? What other viable alternatives do you suggest?

**********India with Indonesia
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India-Indonesia relations;
Why in the News?
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s visit to India as the chief guest at the Republic Day parade highlighted the strong and historic relationship between the two countries.
Evolution of the bilateral relationship between India and Indonesia
Historical Foundations and Early Cooperation:
India and Indonesia established diplomatic relations in 1949, following India’s recognition of Indonesia’s independence in 1946.
The early years were marked by a strong partnership against colonialism, highlighted by President Sukarno’s participation as the chief guest at India’s first Republic Day in 1950 and their collaboration during the Bandung Conference in 1955, which laid the groundwork for the Non-Aligned Movement.
Revitalization in the 1990s:
The relationship saw a significant revival with India’s
‘Look East Policy’
initiated in the 1990s, aimed at strengthening ties with Southeast Asian nations.
This period marked increased political engagement and economic cooperation, culminating in the establishment of a strategic partnership during President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s visit to India in 2005.
Contemporary Engagement and Strategic Partnership:
Recent years have seen a deepening of bilateral relations through comprehensive agreements on defence, maritime security, and economic collaboration.
The signing of the
“Shared Vision of Maritime Cooperation” in 2018
and ongoing joint military exercises reflect a commitment to enhancing security cooperation amid regional challenges, particularly concerning China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea.
What are the implications of India-Indonesia bilateral relations?
Strengthened Strategic Partnership:
The agreement to position an Indonesian liaison officer at India’s Information Fusion Centre highlights a commitment to enhance maritime cooperation and information sharing, which is crucial for regional security amidst rising tensions in the South China Sea.
Collective Security Efforts:
Both nations have emphasized the importance of combating terrorism and have agreed to enhance anti-terror cooperation. This reflects a mutual understanding of shared security challenges and the need for collaborative responses.
Maritime Dialogue:
The establishment of early dialogues on maritime security and cyber security indicates a proactive approach to address emerging threats and maintain stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
How will the agreements reached during this visit impact regional security dynamics?

Support for International Law:
Their joint statement reinforces adherence to international laws, including the 1982 UNCLOS, which could serve as a counterbalance to unilateral actions by China in the South China Sea.
Enhanced Cooperation with ASEAN:
Both countries are likely to strengthen ties with ASEAN nations that share similar concerns about China’s maritime ambitions, fostering a united front in regional diplomacy.
What economic benefits are anticipated from enhanced collaboration?
Local Currency Transactions:
The emphasis on using local currencies for bilateral trade is expected to reduce transaction costs and enhance trade volumes between India and Indonesia, thereby boosting economic ties.
Increased Trade Opportunities:
Enhanced cooperation in sectors such as hydrography and defense could open new avenues for economic collaboration, potentially leading to increased investments and joint ventures.
Maritime Commerce:
By advocating for unimpeded lawful maritime commerce, both nations aim to secure vital trade routes that are crucial for their economies, particularly in light of the South China Sea’s significance as a global trade corridor.
Way forward:
Strengthen Multilateral Diplomacy:
India and Indonesia should continue to collaborate with ASEAN and other regional stakeholders to promote a unified stance on maritime security, focusing on the full implementation of the South China Sea Code of Conduct and adherence to international law.
Enhance Economic Integration:
Both nations should prioritize deepening economic ties through initiatives like local currency transactions and joint ventures in defence and maritime sectors, fostering sustainable growth and bolstering regional economic stability.

**********SEBI proposes sachetization of mutual funds to boost financial inclusion
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Capital Market;
Why in the News?
SEBI is collaborating with the mutual fund industry
to find ways to make monthly SIPs of just Rs 250 possible, aiming to encourage more people from lower-income groups to invest in mutual funds.
What is Sachetisation?
Sachetisation refers to
offering products in small, affordable units,
making them accessible to a broader consumer base, especially those in price-sensitive segments.
The term originated from the
FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) sector,
where products like shampoos were made available in small sachets at low prices to cater to low-income consumers.
SEBI is now proposing a similar approach for mutual funds, allowing small-ticket investments through
SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) with low monthly amounts (such as Rs 250).
What are the significances of Sachetisation?
Affordable Financial Products:
Just as small sachets of consumer goods made them accessible to lower-income groups, small-ticket SIPs in mutual funds can make investment opportunities available to a larger section of the population, particularly those who may not have the financial capacity to invest larger amounts.
Promoting Financial Empowerment:
By lowering the entry barrier for mutual fund investments, sachetisation can help empower underserved communities and individuals by enabling them to participate in the growing financial markets and benefit from the potential returns.
Expanding Reach:
This approach would encourage mutual fund companies to expand their reach to remote locations, helping them penetrate rural and low-income markets, and promote a wider culture of saving and investing.
Financial Inclusion for the Bottom of the Pyramid:
The primary target of sachetisation in mutual funds is low-income groups that have limited access to traditional investment products. By offering small, regular investments, SEBI aims to promote financial inclusion at the grassroots level.
How does it work?
SEBI has proposed introducing
small ticket SIPs at Rs 250 per month,
which would allow new investors from
to participate in mutual funds without the burden of higher minimum investment requirements. This contrasts with existing schemes that often require a
minimum SIP of Rs 500 or more.
Investors can commit to a small ticket SIP for a
duration of five years (60 installments),
although they have the flexibility to withdraw or stop their investments without restrictions if needed. This structure encourages consistent investment while providing an exit option for investors.
To facilitate the success of small ticket SIPs, SEBI plans to implement
discounted rates for intermediaries and reimburse
certain costs from the Investor Education and Awareness Fund. This will help
asset management companies (AMCs)
break even more quickly on their investments in these small ticket offerings.
The sachetised SIPs will be available under
specific mutual fund schemes,
excluding high-risk options like small-cap and mid-cap equity schemes, which are deemed unsuitable for new investors from
lower-income backgrounds.
This targeted approach aims to safeguard these investors while still encouraging their entry into the market.
To further promote financial inclusion, SEBI proposes incentives for distributors who successfully
guide investors through 24 instalments of the small ticket SIP
, thereby enhancing participation and support for new investors in mutual funds.
Conclusion:
The strategy could result in a significant increase in domestic investor participation, contributing to the resilience of India’s equity market and fostering long-term financial stability.

Why in the News?
Researchers have created a
gene-editing tool
to fix
ABCA4 gene mutations
, offering hope for treating Stargardt disease, a rare condition that causes progressive vision loss.
is a
rare inherited eye disorder
, primarily affecting the central part of the retina, called the
macula
It is typically caused by mutations in the
, which disrupts the body’s ability to use Vitamin A, leading to an excessive buildup of
