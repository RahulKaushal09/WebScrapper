What are the Key Recommendations of the World Bank on Boosting Employment Opportunities for Women in India?
Assign Priority Sector Tag for Women-led Rural Enterprises:
study found that loans to women's micro-enterprises are not prioritised separately.
It suggests creating a
new sub-category
within the micro-enterprise sector to cater specifically to women-owned ventures with high growth potential.
Bridging the Digital Divide:
The report emphasised the need to
equip women entrepreneurs with digital literacy,
training programs for digital bookkeeping and payment systems to enhance their financial management capabilities.
Graduation Programs for Sustainable Growth
The report suggests
implementing graduation programs
to help micro-loan borrowers transition to mainstream commercial finance.
It also advocates for the
strategic use of district-level data analytics
by stakeholders, including banks, to
make informed decisions and effectively promote women's entrepreneurship
in rural India.
Strengthening the Institutional Ecosystem:
The report recommends
decentralising incubation centres in rural areas
for mentorship and business support.
It also suggests developing
women's entrepreneur associations
to foster community and peer learning.
Drishti Mains Question:
Discuss the state of Women's workforce participation in Indian corporates. Also, suggest measures to enhance their participation in the workforce.
