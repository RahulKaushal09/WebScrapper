International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation
Source: DTE
Why in News?
The world observed the
Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)
(6
February)
under the theme
"Step up the Pace",
emphasizing the need for stronger alliances and expanding movements to end FGM.
What is Female Genital Mutilation?
Definition:
FGM involves altering or injuring the female genitalia for non-medical reasons. It is internationally recognized as a
violation of human rights
(violates non-discrimination on the basis of sex),
health, and integrity of girls and women.
Health Impacts:
Immediate:
Severe pain, excessive bleeding, infections, shock, and even death.
Long-term:
Chronic pain, infections, menstrual and sexual health issues,
Global Prevalence:
Over
230 million girls and women
worldwide have undergone FGM, mostly in 30 countries across
Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.
FGM is usually performed on
young girls between infancy and age 15.
An estimated
4 million girls
are at risk of undergoing FGM every year, averaging
12,000 cases per day
Reasons for Practicing FGM:
In many communities, FGM is seen as a necessary part of
raising a girl
, preparing her for adulthood and marriage. It is believed to
control female sexuality,
ensuring premarital
virginity
and marital fidelity.
Some mistakenly believe that FGM is a religious requirement, although no religious texts prescribe the practice.
Rooted in gender inequality,
gender-based violence
that harms girls' bodies and endangers their lives.
Elimnaiton:
The UN aims to eliminate FGM by 2030 under
Sustainable Development Goal
5.3
, which targets ending harmful practices like child marriage and FGM.
Challenges:
Progress remains uneven, with opposition in some regions, such as
Gambia's
attempts to repeal the FGM ban.
Nearly 7 million girls and women have accessed prevention services, but the global decline
must be 27 times faster to end FGM by 2030.
Of the 31 countries where data is collected on FGM prevalence, only
are on track to meet the
2030 UN SDG
target to eliminate the practice.
Increasing
trend of healthcare providers
performing FGM, under the false belief that it makes the
practice safer.
Call for Collaborative Efforts:
Countries like
Kenya
Uganda
have shown declining prevalence rates due to community-led initiatives and stronger policies.
UN agencies urged for increased collaboration among governments, civil society, healthcare providers, and grassroots organisations to eliminate FGM.

Rising Online Child Abuse
Source: HT
Why in News?
A study published in
The Lancet
, based on a comprehensive analysis of
123 studies
from various regions, has highlighted the
growing concern of online sexual abuse
faced by children worldwide.
What are the Key Findings of the Study on Online Child Abuse?
Prevalence of Abuse:
It highlights that
one in 12 children globally
(approximately
8.3%)
experienced online sexual abuse
in the last decade
Types of Exploitation:
The study identified several subtypes of online sexual abuse, including
online solicitation
involving sexual inquiries/conversations (12.5%),
non-consensual image sharing
(12.6%),
online sexual exploitation
(4.7%), and
sexual extortion
(3.5%).
Gender Dynamics:
There is
no significant difference in online abuse rates between boys and girls,
challenging earlier beliefs that girls are more vulnerable.
This suggests
changing online environments and behaviors,
with
increasing risks for boys.
Mental Health Implications:
The report links online sexual exploitation to
severe mental and physical health consequences
for victims, including
lower life expectancy
and reduced employment prospects.
What are the Reasons for Rising Online Child Abuse?
Increased Internet Access: Widespread internet access
has significantly
increased children's online presence (1/3 of internet users)
rendering them vulnerable to exploitation, especially in unsupervised social media and gaming.
Pandemic-Related Factors:
Increased online activity during
Covid-19 pandemic
enabled
offenders to exploit children,
leading to a surge in abuse cases, including a
threefold rise in sextortion since March 2020.
Advancements in Technology
: The large number of
artificial intelligence (AI)
tools and
digital platforms
has made it easier for offenders to create and distribute
child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
that is difficult to
detect and trace.
Lack of Digital Literacy
Limited awareness of online safety
makes users vulnerable; only
38% of Indian households are digitally  literate.
Inadequate Monitoring and Enforcement
: Law enforcement and technology companies face challenges in keeping up with
rapidly evolving online platforms
, leaving
gaps in monitoring and enforcement.
What Measures Can Be Taken to Prevent Online Child Abuse?
Strong Legislation and Enforcement:
Stronger Legislation
: Implement
stricter legal frameworks
with enhanced penalties for offenders.
International Cooperation
: Strengthen
collaboration with agencies
like
INTERPOL and FBI
to dismantle
cross-border abuse networks.
Robust Reporting Systems
: Improve
real-time reporting and
monitoring tools for social-media platforms,
establish
confidential helplines,
and encourage social networks to report emerging ways to share abuse material.
Public Awareness and Education
: Promote
digital literacy and online safety
through
awareness campaigns
for children, parents, and educators.
Enhance
online safety through dedicated kids’ sections
, features like
“safe search”
on social media and browsing platforms,
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
based content filtering, and
parental controls.
Collaboration with Tech Industry
: Encourage tech companies to
adopt stricter content moderation, better age-verification
, and develop
ethical AI tools
to prevent CSAM creation on dark web platforms.
Need for Further Research:
Invest in
extensive research and data collection
, especially in underrepresented regions around the world, to develop
evidence-based policie
strengthen child protection frameworks.
Drishti Mains Question:
Discuss the state of cybercrime in India and its impact on children. Suggest measures to mitigate these threats.

Legal Basis for the Ban
The ban is enforced under
Section 163
of the
Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023
This law empowers officials such as the
district magistrate, sub-divisional magistrate, or any other executive magistrate
to issue an order in urgent cases of
‘nuisance or apprehended danger.’
The order can prohibit any person from engaging in a particular act.
Applicability
: The law applies to residents of a particular place, those visiting a specific area, or the general public frequenting certain locations.
Punishment under the Ban :
Violators of the ban will be punished under
Section 223
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS
), 2023, which includes:
Up to six months imprisonment or a fine of ₹2,500 or both.
If the act poses a danger to public health or safety, punishment increases to one year imprisonment and a fine of ₹5,000.

It can be extended
for up to six months
by the state government.
Who is a Beggar?
Definition of a Beggar (as per Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959):
A beggar is anyone who:
Solicits alms in any form.
Performs or offers items for sale.
Appears destitute and lacks visible means of subsistence.
Colonial Law:
The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 criminalized nomadic tribes, linking them with vagrancy and begging.
Constitutional Reference:
The Constitution of India allows
both Union and state governments to
enact laws related to vagrancy, beggary, and nomadic/migratory tribes
Concurrent List (List III, Entry 15).
Precedence
: There is no national law on begging. Instead, many states and Union Territories follow the
Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959.
Delhi High Court (2018):
Struck down multiple provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, calling them “manifestly arbitrary” and violative of Article 21 (Right to Life with Dignity).
Supreme Court of India (2021):
Rejected a PIL that sought to remove beggars from public spaces.
Stated that begging is a socio-economic issue rather than a criminal offense.
Reasons for Begging in India
Economic Factors:
Poverty, unemployment, underemployment, and rural-urban migration force individuals into begging due to lack of opportunities.
Natural Disasters
: Displacement caused by floods, droughts, or famines leaves people homeless and reliant on begging for survival.
Social Issues:
Family disintegration, ancestral profession, and widowhood contribute to the prevalence of begging.
Physical and Psychological Challenges:
Lack of rehabilitation for disabled individuals and mental health issues drive people to beg.
Organized Begging Cartels:
Begging is often controlled by syndicates that exploit vulnerable individuals, especially in urban areas.

Support for Marginalized Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise (SMILE) Scheme
Launched in 2022 by the
Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.
Objective:
To rehabilitate beggars by offering medical care, education, and skill training.

Statistics (as per Census 2011):
India has approximately
4,13,670 beggars
vagrants.
West Bengal has the highest number of beggars, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Implications of Begging
Discrimination and Exploitation:
Beggars, especially those with disabilities, face social exclusion and are vulnerable to abuse by organized begging gangs and traffickers.
Public Health and Hygiene Risks:
Begging hotspots often lack sanitation, leading to disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and additional strain on public healthcare systems.
Crime and Human Trafficking:
Organized syndicates force children and vulnerable individuals into begging, sometimes using drug addiction and physical abuse to control them.
Impact on Urban Spaces and Tourism:
Aggressive begging creates security concerns, discourages tourism, and reinforces negative perceptions of India’s cities.
Pros and Cons of Ban on Begging
Reduces exploitation by begging cartels
Encourages rehabilitation programs
Improves urban aesthetics and tourism
Addresses public health and safety concerns
Promotes donations to credible charities
Criminalizes poverty, targeting vulnerable groups
Lacks adequate infrastructure for rehabilitation
Violates dignity and right to livelihood
May push beggars into illegal activities
Enforcement challenges and misuse of laws

Way Forward
Strict Enforcement Against Exploitation:
Strengthen anti-trafficking laws and dismantle begging cartels through police-NGO collaboration, focusing on rehabilitation over punishment.
Public Awareness and Community Support:
Promote donations to credible charities instead of direct almsgiving to prevent organized exploitation.
Rehabilitation and Employment:
Expand government shelters, provide skill training, and integrate beggars into the workforce for long-term economic stability.
Policy Reforms and Local Partnerships:
Develop holistic policies addressing unemployment and homelessness, engaging businesses to create sustainable livelihoods.

Exploitation of Domestic Workers
Source: TH
Why in News?
The
Supreme Court (SC) of India
has raised concerns over the
exploitation and abuse of
domestic workers in India
due to the
absence of a protective legal framework.
It has directed the Centre to form an
inter-ministerial expert committee
to assess the need for a protective law.
Who are Domestic Workers?
About:
According to the
ILO
, Domestic workers are those workers who
perform work in or for a private household or households.
They provide
direct and indirect care services,
and as such are key members of the
care economy.
Status of Domestic Workers in India:
Women make up the majority of domestic workers in India, with
26 lakh of the 39 lakh workers being female,
according to 2019 government estimates.
12.6 million minors
are employed as domestic workers (
86% are girls
, and
25% are under 14 years old)
Characteristics of Domestic Workers:
Informal and Unregulated
: Most domestic workers
lack job contracts, social security, and legal protection
Live-in and Part-time Work
: Some workers live with their employers (live-in workers), while others work in multiple households (part-time workers).
Migration:
Domestic workers often migrate from
poverty-stricken states like Jharkhand, Bihar, and Odisha
to cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai, as well as to
Arab States,
due to extreme poverty and a lack of job opportunities.
Marginalized Communities:
The workforce is primarily composed of marginalized communities from
Scheduled Castes (SCs)
Other Backward Classes (OBCs)
Scheduled Tribes (STs).
What are the concerns of Domestic Workers India?
Low Wages
: Many earn below the
minimum wage,
no formal contracts.
They often work
excessive hours
without breaks or
overtime pay.
Abuse
: Workers face
physical and emotional abuse,
including beatings, harsh conditions,
sexual harassment
forced labour
human trafficking
, particularly minors from vulnerable communities.
states domestic work as a
"modern slavery" practice,
where workers, including minors, are vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, forced labor, and trafficking.
Sexual Harassment
: Female workers are vulnerable to sexual abuse. Many cases of abuse go
unreported due to fear of retaliation
or the lack of legal recourse.
Exploitation by Agencies
: Placement agencies exploit domestic workers by charging
high fees for employment,
without guaranteeing fair wages or safe conditions.
Workers are often not informed about the terms of their employment, including wages or job responsibilities.
Pandemic:
Covid-19
worsened conditions, a 2020 study found that 57% of domestic workers in Kochi, Delhi, and Mumbai faced discrimination, while 40% worked without safety measures.
What Laws Govern Domestic Work in India?
No Dedicated Central Law:
Domestic workers are excluded from mainstream labor laws as
"workman" and "workplace"
definitions do not cover household work, often seen as
"unproductive" women's labor.
Multiple attempts were made to pass a Central law to protect domestic workers, including the
Domestic Workers (Conditions of Employment) Bill of 1959
and the
Domestic Workers (Regulation of Work and Social Security) Bill of 2017.
2019 National Domestic Worker Policy
aimed to regulate agencies and ensure workers' rights,
, social security, and benefits.
However, none of these proposed laws were enacted.
Weak Legal Protections:
Unorganised Sector Social Security Act, 2008
: Provided some benefits but was later replaced by the
Code on Social Security, 2020
, which
has not been implemented
Minimum Wages Act, 1948
: Recognizes domestic work, but
only 10 states
have set minimum wages for domestic workers.
Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act, 2013
: Recognizes domestic workers but
lacks an enforcement mechanism
Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986
: In 2006, India banned minors under 14 from domestic work, deeming it
"hazardous child labor,
" but the
Child Labour Act, 1986
, allows
children over 14 to work in homes, considering them a "safe" place.
State Laws: Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Kerala
have implemented laws to protect domestic workers.
These states have established
specialized bodies
to oversee social security benefits, maternity care, education assistance, medical reimbursements, and minimum wages.
Global Protections:
In 2011, India voted in favor of
ILO Convention 189
, which aims to improve domestic workers' conditions by recognizing
domestic work as legitimate work
ensuring domestic workers enjoy the same rights as others.
However, India has yet to ratify the convention.

Way Forward
Policy Changes:
Implement the
Draft National Domestic Worker Policy, 2019
to regulate placement agencies, ensure mandatory contracts with fair wages and benefits, and include domestic workers in social security and pension schemes.
Ratify the
, create laws to protect domestic workers' rights, recognize their
work as legitimate,
and ensure legal protection and policy enforcement.
Anti-Trafficking Measures:
Mandatory registration of
placement agencies to ensure transparency, additionally,
ensure strict enforcement of anti-trafficking laws under the
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023
which mandates punishment up to
life imprisonment
for trafficking offenses, including those involving domestic workers.
Empower Workers:
Raise awareness of domestic workers' rights, provide access to legal aid and social services, and establish a
statutory body to address grievances.
Drishti Mains Question:
Q. Critically examine the exploitation of domestic workers in India and suggest measures to improve their working conditions and social security.
UPSC Civil Services Examination, Previous Year Questions (PYQs)
Distinguish between ‘care economy’ and ‘monetized economy’. How can the care economy be brought into a monetized economy through women empowerment?
