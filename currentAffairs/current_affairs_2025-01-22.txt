EXCAVATION IN RATNAGIRI
Syllabus:
Prelims – ART & CULTURE, HISTORY
Context:
The Archaeological Survey of India recently resumed excavations at Odisha’s Ratnagiri Buddhist complex, uncovering a colossal Buddha head, a massive palm, an ancient wall, and inscribed relics from the 8th-9th Century AD.
Background: –
The discoveries are significant, especially given Odisha’s historical relationship with Buddhism beginning with Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (304-232 BCE), one of Buddhism’s greatest patrons whose invasion of the kingdom of Kalinga – the ancient name for Odisha – led to him embracing the religion.
Key takeaways
Ratnagiri — the centre of ancient Buddhist learning

Located 100 km northeast of Bhubaneswar and part of the famous Diamond Triangle of Odisha along with Udaygiri and Lalitgiri, Ratnagiri – translated as the ‘Hills of Jewels’ – was first documented as a historical site in 1905.
The last excavations carried out between 1958 and 1961 led to the discovery of many remains — including a brick stupa, three monastic complexes and over hundreds of votive and commemorative stupas.
However, with the ASI eventually shifting focus on sites such as Lalitgiri, where the oldest Buddhist monastery in the state was found, the Ratnagiri excavation was put on the backburner.
Experts date Ratnagiri to the 5th and 13th Century, although the peak period of construction is dated between the 7th and 10th centuries. Ratnagiri rivalled Nalanda as a learning centre.
There are some studies that suggest that the renowned Chinese Buddhist monk and traveller, Hiuen Tsang, who visited Odisha, during 638-639 AD, might have visited Ratnagiri.
Odisha, Southeast Asia and Buddhism
Odisha has long enjoyed maritime and trade links with Southeast Asian countries: pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, silk, camphor, gold, and jewellery were popular items of trade between the ancient kingdom of Kalinga and Southeast Asia.
Even though there was no evidence of Buddha visiting Odisha during his lifetime, Kalinga played a great role in popularising Buddhism, especially in Southeast Asia, because of its trade link: experts believe that Tapassu and Bhallika, the two merchant brothers who became the first disciples of Lord Buddha, having their origins from Utkala, another ancient name of Odisha.
Mauryan Emperor Ashoka is believed to have invaded Kalinga in 261 BC but, deeply moved by the bloodshed, he embraced Buddhism, which he eventually helped spread not only to his own empire but also to Sri Lanka, and Central and Southeast Asia.
In Odisha, Buddhism is stated to have particularly flourished under the Bhaumakara dynasty, which ruled parts of the state in between the 8th and 10th Century.
Odisha annually holds Baliyatra, literally ‘voyage to Bali’ – a seven-day festival to commemorate the 2,000-year-old maritime and cultural links between Kalinga and Bali and other South and Southeast Asian regions such as Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka).

DEATH PENALTY
Mains – GS 2 & GS 4
A sessions court in Kolkata sentenced Sanjoy Roy, convicted of the rape and murder of a doctor at RG Kar Medical College, to life imprisonment. The CBI had argued strongly for the death penalty in the case that shook West Bengal and triggered several weeks of protests.
The Supreme Court has held that a sentence of death should be passed only in the “rarest of rare” cases, after the court has considered possible “aggravating” and “mitigating” circumstances (Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, 1980).
In Bachan Singh, the SC considered a challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty. It upheld the death penalty, but said it should be imposed only in the “rarest of rare” cases where there is no possibility of reformation.
The five-judge Constitution Bench did not specify the standards to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed, but laid down non-exhaustive lists of “aggravating” and “mitigating” circumstances for courts to consider while making the decision.
Aggravating circumstances, which could tilt the court’s decision towards the death penalty:
If the murder is pre-planned, calculated, and involves extreme brutality;
If the murder involves “exceptional depravity”;
If the accused has been found guilty of murdering a public servant, police officer or a member of the armed forces while on duty, or because of anything they may have lawfully done while discharging their duty.
Mitigating circumstances, which could tilt a case away from the death penalty:
Whether the accused was “under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance” at the time of the offence;
Age of the accused; they would not be given death if they are very young or very old;
Probability of the accused posing a continued threat to society;
Probability of reforming the accused;
If the accused was acting on the directions of another person;
If the accused believed their actions were morally justified;
If the accused suffers mentally and is unable to appreciate the criminality of their actions.
The understanding of mitigating and aggravating circumstances has evolved over the years, and new factors have been added through several decisions.
In Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab (1983), the SC held that death could be given in cases where the “collective conscience” of society is so shocked that the judiciary is expected to impose the death penalty.
In Santosh Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra (2009), the SC said “the court will have to provide clear evidence as to why the convict is not fit for any kind of reformatory and rehabilitation scheme”.
The Law Commission of India noted in its 262nd Report (2015), The Death Penalty, age as a mitigating factor has been used very inconsistently.
The Law Commission Report said the requirement for evidence was held as essential in Bariyar for introducing an element of objectivity into the sentencing process.
When should the court consider these circumstances?
In Bachan Singh, the SC said courts must conduct a separate trial after convicting, so that judges can be persuaded why the death sentence should not be imposed.
In Dattaraya v. State of Maharashtra (2020), the court held that such a hearing did not take place, and that this was a valid reason to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment.

MOUNT IBU
Prelims – GEOGRAPHY
Indonesia’s Mount Ibu has erupted at least a thousand times this month, according to an official report, as efforts are under way to evacuate thousands of villagers.
Mount Ibu sent a column of smoke up to 4 km into the sky in an eruption on January 15. It was one of 1,079 eruptions by the volcano recorded since January 1 by Indonesia’s Geological Agency, sending columns of ash reaching between 0.3 km and 4 km above its peak.
Mount Ibu is classified as a stratovolcano, which indicates a conical volcano built up by many layers of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash.
Situated on Halmahera Island, Indonesia.
Positioned within the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area known for frequent volcanic activity and earthquakes.
Why is Mount Ibu Important?
Geological Significance: Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, contributing to the study of plate tectonics and volcanic processes.
Hazard Management: Frequent eruptions require effective disaster management strategies to protect local populations.
Biodiversity: Halmahera Island, where Mount Ibu is located, is part of the Wallacea region, known for unique biodiversity.
Global Climate Impact: Volcanic eruptions release sulfur dioxide and ash into the atmosphere, potentially influencing weather patterns and global temperatures.

BOREAL FORESTS
Nearly half of the global boreal forests — spanning Canada, Alaska and Siberia — are undergoing major transitions due to climate change, making them increasingly vulnerable to forest fires and altering their role as a key carbon sink, a new study has revealed.
Boreal forests, also known as Taiga, are the largest terrestrial biome on Earth, forming a critical part of the planet’s ecological balance.
Boreal forests are primarily found in the high northern latitudes, forming a circumboreal belt around the world, spanning across northern Europe, Asia, and North America.
They are located between temperate forests in the south and the Arctic tundra in the north.
Characteristics
Climate: Boreal forests experience long, cold winters and short, mild summers. The regions are characterized by low temperatures, low precipitation, and frequent snow cover.
Vegetation: The predominant vegetation consists mainly of coniferous trees like pines, spruces, and larches. There are also some deciduous trees, such as birches and poplars. Understory vegetation includes shrubs, mosses, and lichens.
Soils: The soils in boreal forests are usually acidic and nutrient-poor, formed under cool, moist conditions which slow down the decomposition of organic matter. This results in a thick layer of litter on the forest floor.
Ecological Importance
Carbon Storage: Boreal forests are vital carbon sinks, holding more carbon than all tropical forests combined. The accumulation of organic matter, under cold temperatures, leads to large stores of carbon.
Biodiversity: They support a variety of wildlife adapted to the cold, such as moose, caribou, wolves, bears, and many bird species. These forests also provide essential breeding grounds for several migratory bird species.
Hydrology: Boreal forests contain substantial amounts of surface freshwater and play a critical role in regulating the water cycle.

**********Ratnagiri Buddhist Site
Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has discovered significant Buddhist remains during renewed excavations at the historic Ratnagiri site in Jajpur district adding another chapter to its 1,200-year-old legacy.
About Ratnagiri Site:
It is located 100 km northeast of Bhubaneswar, Odisha.
The site stands on a
hill between Birupa and Brahmani rivers
and is Odisha’s most famous and most excavated Buddhist site.
It is part of the famous
Diamond Triangle
of Odisha along with Udaygiri and Lalitgiri, translated as the
‘Hills of Jewels’
Time Period:
Experts date Ratnagiri to the
5th and 13th Century
, although the peak period of construction is dated between the 7th and 10th centuries.
It was a center for
Mahayana and Tantrayana
(also known as Vajrayana) Buddhism.
There are some studies that suggest that the renowned Chinese
Buddhist monk and traveller, Hiuen Tsang
visited here during 638-639 AD.
So far ASI have unearthed a
colossal Buddha head, a massive palm, an ancient wall and inscribed Buddhist relics
, all of which are estimated to date back 8th and 9th Century AD.
Buddhism in Odisha and links with Southeast Asian countries:
Mauryan Emperor
Ashoka
is believed to have invaded
Kalinga
in 261 BC but, deeply moved by the bloodshed in the war, he eventually embraced Buddhism.
In Odisha, Buddhism is stated to have particularly flourished under the
Bhaumakara dynasty
, which ruled parts of the State in
between the 8th and 10th Century.
Odisha has long enjoyed
maritime and trade links
with Southeast Asian countries. According to historians, pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, silk, camphor, gold, and jewellery were popular items of trade between the ancient kingdom of
Kalinga and Southeast Asia.
The State also annually holds
Baliyatra, literally ‘voyage to Bali’
– a seven-day festival to commemorate the 2,000-year-old maritime and cultural links between Kalinga and Bali and other South and Southeast Asian regions such as Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka).

**********Mount McKinley
Recently, the US President signed an executive order renaming Denali to Mount McKinley.
About Mount McKinley:
It is the highest peak in
North America.
It is located near the centre of the
Alaska Range
, with two summits rising above the
Denali Fault
in south-central Alaska,
S.
The mountain is essentially a
giant block of granite
that was lifted above Earth’s crust during a period of tectonic activity that began about 60 million years ago.
It rises abruptly some 18,000 feet (5,500 metres) from Denali Fault at its base to the higher, more southerly of its two summits.
The upper half of the mountain is
covered with permanent snowfields
that feed many glaciers like Kahiltna Glacier, the Muldrow Glacier, the Peters Glacier, the Ruth Glacier, and the Traleika Glacier.
It forms the central feature of the
Denali National Park and Preserve.
Key facts about the Denali Fault:
It is located in
southern Alaska
, has played a crucial role in shaping Earth's geological history.
A study reveals
that three sites
along the Denali Fault were once part of a single geologic feature, symbolizing the final joining of two landmasses millions of years ago.
Over 483 km of horizontal movement along the fault tore apart this united feature due to millions of years of tectonic activity.
These three locations once formed a
terminal suture zone,
indicating the last phase of tectonic plate integration into a larger mass.

**********Oyster
A groundbreaking find by Southern Cross University has shown oysters might be able to help treat a growing worldwide public health problem: antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
About Oyster:
Oysters are
marine animals
belonging to the
phylum Mollusca,
found in
brackish habitats.
They are very
irregular in shape
and the valves of some are highly calcified.
Characteristics:
These marine animals can filter up to 1.3 gallons of water per hour.
They are animals with
eyes all over their body
. These eyes help them escape their predators.
These creatures are known to hide in their
shell upon sensing danger
. The shells then close tightly to protect them.
These animals do
not have a central nervous system
. Therefore, they cannot feel pain like humans.
They are animals that
eat algae
and other food particles that are usually drawn to their gills.
They are known to reproduce through
broadcast spawning in warm waters
and are also
capable of changing their gender
Key points about the finding:
Oysters are exposed to high concentrations of diverse microorganisms in their natural marine environment. Because of this, they have
evolved strong immune defences.
For example, they rely
heavily on antimicrobial proteins
and strings of molecules known as
peptides in their hemolymph
(blood) to protect them from infection.
The study showed that the antimicrobial proteins isolated from the
oyster hemolymph
(the equivalent of blood) can kill certain bacteria responsible for a range of infections.
The proteins can also
improve the efficacy of conventional antibiotics
against problematic bacteria species.

**********Antivenom
A terrible number, estimated 58000 snakebite cases renders India the ‘snakebite capital’ of the world and in this regard antivenoms plays a crucial role.
About Antivenom:
Antivenoms are life-saving medicines used to
treat snakebites.
They work by specifically
binding to the venom toxins
to render them ineffective, allowing the body’s natural defence systems to clear them safely over time.
How lethal is Snake venom?
Snake venom is one of nature’s most lethal weapons, a complex cocktail of toxic proteins.
Haemotoxins destroy blood cells
and disrupt clotting.
Neurotoxins
block nerve signals and paralyse.
Cytotoxins
dissolve tissues
at the bite site. The effects are often fatal without medical intervention.
Productions of Antivenoms:
French physician
Albert Calmette in
the 1890s developed the first antivenom using horses, a practice that continues today.
To produce antivenom, healthy and
mature venomous snakes
are first captured from the wild by trained experts who then extract the venom from them.
Next, they immunise horses with increasing doses of venom over many weeks, allowing their immune systems to produce antibodies.
Over time, the horses develop a robust immune response, producing antibodies that neutralise venom toxins. These
antibodies are antivenoms.
The experts extract these antibodies from the horse’s blood and purify and formulate them as
The antibodies thus produced are very specific to the type of toxins injected.
Polyvalent antivenoms
(PVAs) target multiple snake species. However, their efficacy varies against less common snakes.
Issues in India:
India is the world’s largest producer and consumer of antivenoms in the world.
However, access to
timely medical care remains a significant challenge
for many Indians.
Administration issue:
Improper administration
and inadequate facilities exacerbate the crisis.
Logistical issues
, unequal access to care,
superstitious beliefs, and cultural practices
often delay proper treatment in many parts.
Lack of Infrastructure:
Antivenoms often need to be transported in cold storage, however, India’s rural parts lack the supporting infrastructure and power supply.
The high cost of manufacturing antivenom limits accessibility for the economically-disadvantaged.

**********Indus Waters Treaty, 1960 — Decision by the Neutral Expert on his competence
Why in news?
Michel Lino, the World Bank-appointed Neutral Expert (NE), declared he is “competent” to decide differences on hydroelectric projects under the
Indus Water Treaty (IWT), 1960
.
India welcomed the decision, emphasizing that all seven technical disputes fall within the NE's jurisdiction.
The IWT allocates the three eastern rivers (Sutlej, Beas, Ravi) to India and the three western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan. Signed in 1960, the treaty aimed at equitable water sharing between the two nations.
What’s in today’s article?
Dispute Resolution Mechanism under the Indus Water Treaty (IWT)
Background of the Dispute
Neutral Expert's Decision
About Dispute Resolution Mechanism under the Indus Water Treaty (IWT)
The IWT 1960 outlines a three-tiered dispute resolution process to address disagreements regarding projects on the Indus rivers.
Article IX of the treaty defines this structured mechanism.
Level 1: Permanent Indus Commission (PIC)
Initial Notification
: Both parties must inform each other about any planned projects on the Indus rivers, sharing all relevant information.
Role of PIC
: The Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), established under the IWT, is responsible for managing and overseeing the treaty's objectives.
Outcome
: If the PIC fails to resolve the disagreement, the issue is escalated to the next level.
Level 2: Neutral Expert Appointment
World Bank’s Role
: If the PIC is unable to resolve the dispute, the World Bank appoints a neutral expert to mediate the issue.
Resolution Attempts
: The neutral expert's goal is to resolve the dispute through technical assessments and recommendations.
Escalation
: If the neutral expert cannot resolve the matter, it is considered a formal dispute and moves to the final level.
Level 3: Court of Arbitration (CoA)
Final Step
: When a dispute persists after the neutral expert's intervention, it is referred to the Court of Arbitration (CoA).
Chairperson
: The chair of the CoA is appointed by the World Bank.
Final Decision
: The CoA is the final body to adjudicate the dispute, with its decisions considered binding.
This three-tiered structure ensures that disputes over the Indus waters are addressed in a graduated manner, with efforts focused first on cooperation and technical expertise before moving to formal arbitration.
The dispute between India and Pakistan centers on the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects.
Kishenganga Project:
On the Kishenganga River, a tributary of Jhelum.
Ratle Project:
On the Chenab River.
India advocates resolution through a neutral expert, as outlined in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960, while Pakistan supports the involvement of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (CoA) in The Hague.
Pakistan raised objections to these projects, initially seeking the appointment of a Neutral Expert in 2015.
However, in 2016, Pakistan unilaterally withdrew this request and sought adjudication by a Court of Arbitration, violating the dispute resolution mechanism outlined in Article IX of the treaty.
Pakistan bypassed the sequence mentioned in dispute redressal mechanism under IWT and sought arbitration directly in 2016.
India then requested the matter to be referred to a Neutral Expert.
Parallel Mechanisms and Legal Challenges
Pakistan’s move for a CoA led to the World Bank facilitating both a Neutral Expert and a CoA in 2022.
India has refused to participate in the CoA, calling it "illegally constituted" and contrary to treaty provisions.
Engagement on Treaty Review
India and Pakistan are also in contact under Article XII (3) of the IWT for the review and potential modification of the treaty.
India issued formal notices to Pakistan for review (August 30, 2024) and modification (January 2023) of the treaty.
Pakistan has not formally responded despite four letters from India.
The World Bank-appointed neutral expert, Michel Lino, ruled in favor of India's stance, affirming his competence under Paragraph 7 of Annexure F of the IWT to resolve the differences.
India's Response
India welcomed the decision.
Earlier, India had dismissed the legitimacy of the Court of Arbitration, calling it illegally constituted and reaffirmed that the treaty does not allow parallel proceedings on the same issues.
The Ministry of External Affairs stated that the ruling upholds India's consistent position that the neutral expert is the appropriate authority to address the seven issues concerning the two projects.
Next Steps

**********Trump signs executive order to end US birthright citizenship
Why in news?
On his first day in office, US President Donald Trump signed several executive orders, including a controversial one aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of parents without legal status.
This decision drew immediate backlash, prompting lawsuits from immigrant and civil rights groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union.

Birthright Citizenship and the 14th Amendment
Trump’s Executive Order on Birthright Citizenship
Impact on the Indian Community
About Birthright citizenship in the US
Birthright citizenship automatically grants citizenship at birth.
In the US, it exists in two forms:
jus soli
(citizenship based on birthplace) and
jus sanguinis
(citizenship based on ancestry, for children born abroad to US citizens).
The Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution, adopted in 1868 after the Civil War, guarantees birthright citizenship.
It states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”
This was originally intended to ensure citizenship for America-born children of formerly enslaved people.
US President Trump has signed an executive order ending birthright citizenship for children of parents without legal status.
Categories Excluded from Birthright Citizenship
According to Trump’s executive order, individuals
not subject to the jurisdiction of the US Constitution
fall into two main categories:
Unlawful Presence
When the mother was unlawfully present in the US at the time of birth.
The father was neither a US citizen nor a lawful permanent resident.
Lawful but Temporary Presence
When the mother was lawfully in the US temporarily (e.g., under a visa or the Visa Waiver Program).
Interpretation
President Trump’s executive order challenges the traditional interpretation of the 14th Amendment.
It emphasizes that birthright citizenship is not universally applicable.
It argues that the amendment excludes individuals born in the US who are not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”
Legal Challenge
Requirement for a Constitutional Amendment
Eliminating birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment. This process demands:
A two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Approval by three-quarters of US states.
Republican Majority
Trump’s Republican Party holds a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, which could influence the legislative process.
The executive order seeks to revoke automatic citizenship for children born in the US to non-citizen parents, potentially impacting immigrant communities, including Indian Americans.
H-1B Visa Holders and Green Card Backlogs
Indian professionals on H-1B visas and Green Card applicants will be affected as their US-born children may lose automatic citizenship.
Families already waiting for Green Cards face additional uncertainty about their children’s future in the US.
Indian Students in the US
Indian students, who form a significant group of international students in the US, will face difficulties securing citizenship for children born during their study tenure.
Discouragement from Moving to the US
Indian professionals, students, and families may opt for immigration-friendly countries like Canada and Australia instead.
Economic Impact
The Indian community contributes significantly to the US tech industry, healthcare, and education sectors. Revoking birthright citizenship could reduce these contributions.
Conclusion
Trump’s executive order has created uncertainty for Indian professionals, students, and families in the US. While legal challenges are underway, the potential loss of automatic citizenship could deter Indians from seeking opportunities in the US, shifting their focus to other countries.
The Indian-American community, one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups, will be significantly affected if the policy is implemented.

**********The U.S. Withdrawal from WHO: Implications for Global Health
Why in the News?
On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the
World Health Organization
(WHO).
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
About the Withdrawal (Reasons, Implications, Consequences for US, Challenges for WHO, etc.)
Background:
President Donald Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the WHO.
This decision marks the second attempt by Trump to exit the global health body, citing dissatisfaction with WHO’s management during the COVID-19 pandemic, perceived political biases, and disproportionate financial burdens placed on the U.S.
Trump had initially announced a withdrawal during his first term in 2020. However, this was reversed by then-President Joe Biden in 2021.
The new executive order revives the debate, calling into question the role of the U.S. in global health diplomacy and its commitment to multilateralism.
Key Reasons for the Withdrawal:
Mishandling of the COVID-19 Pandemic:
Trump criticized WHO’s delayed response to the pandemic and its handling of China's accountability in the initial stages of the outbreak.
Perceived Political Bias:
The administration accused WHO of being overly influenced by certain member states, including China.
Financial Burden:
The U.S. contributes the highest assessed membership dues, ranging between $100 to $122 million annually, and nearly $1.3 billion in voluntary funding in 2022-2023.
Trump labelled this burden “unfair” when compared to China’s significantly lower contributions.
Immediate Actions Outlined in the Executive Order:
Halt in U.S. Funding
: Immediate cessation of all financial transfers to WHO.
Personnel Withdrawal
: Recall of U.S. government employees working with WHO.
Development of Alternatives
: Identification of credible domestic and international partners to replace WHO’s functions.
Pandemic Treaty Exit
: Discontinuation of negotiations on the WHO’s pandemic treaty, a framework aimed at improving global pandemic responses.
Implications of the Withdrawal:
Financial Strain on WHO:
The U.S. contributes nearly 20% of WHO’s funding. Losing this would severely impact the organization’s ability to support health programs, including vaccine development, eradication of diseases like polio, and pandemic preparedness.
Program Disruptions in Developing Nations:
WHO aids various global health programs, including India's immunization and disease surveillance efforts. Reduced funding could hinder these initiatives, particularly in low-resource countries.
Loss of Expertise:
The withdrawal would sever collaboration between WHO and U.S. institutions like the CDC, which are instrumental in global health surveillance and response.
Domestic Consequences:
Limited Access to Global Health Data:
The U.S. would lose access to critical information on emerging infectious diseases, potentially leaving the country vulnerable to new health threats.
Vaccine Preparedness:
Exiting the WHO could impact access to influenza strain samples, essential for producing effective vaccines, leading to increased hospitalizations and deaths from preventable diseases like the flu.
Reduced Influence in Global Health Policy:
By withdrawing, the U.S. would relinquish its leadership role, creating a vacuum likely to be filled by countries like
. This shift could reduce America’s diplomatic leverage in international health.
Geopolitical Shifts and the Role of Emerging Economies:
S. withdrawal may pave the way for greater involvement from China and the Global South, including India
China has already pledged $30 million in additional funding to WHO, a move likely to strengthen its influence in global health governance.
Experts suggest this is an opportunity for India and other emerging economies to step up.
India’s leadership in vaccine production and its positioning as the "voice of the Global South" can play a pivotal role in shaping a balanced global health framework.
Challenges for WHO:
WHO faces significant internal criticisms, including slow responses to health crises and inefficiencies in implementing reforms.
While funding cuts may exacerbate these issues, experts argue that constructive engagement rather than withdrawal is a better strategy to drive meaningful reform within the organization.
Way Forward:
Judicial Clarity:
Legal experts question the constitutionality of Trump’s decision, suggesting Congressional approval may be required for withdrawal.
Reforming WHO:
WHO must address inefficiencies, improve transparency, and speed up emergency response protocols to regain trust and maintain global health leadership.
Strengthened Collaboration with Emerging Economies:
Nations like India and South Africa should collaborate to fill the financial and strategic gap left by the U.S. withdrawal.

Editorial Analysis
**********Trump 2.0 as Disruptor of the Global Legal Order
Context
Donald Trump’s return to the presidency has sparked discussions about the beginning of a new Trumpian era,
characterised by his unorthodox leadership and disruptive tendencies.
This
era is expected to significantly impact the global legal and institutional frameworks
, potentially redefining the United States’ complex relationship with international law.
As a leading global power,
the U.S. has historically balanced its role as a key architect of international law
with a pattern of exceptionalism that often undermines the same systems it helped create.
Under Trump’s leadership, this dichotomy reached unprecedented levels,
and his second term could exacerbate these challenges further.
A Complicated Relationship of the U.S. and International Law
The
United States has played a pivotal role in establishing and shaping international legal frameworks
to align with its interests.
Its
influence spans critical areas such as climate change, space law, human rights,
and trade.
However,
this leadership has been accompanied by a policy of exceptionalism, where the U.S. often views itself as distinct and exempt from the rules
binding other nations.
Critics argue that
this undermines the credibility and efficacy of international law,
especially when the U.S. disregards the very norms it expects others to follow.
Features of Trump’s First Term
A Sovereigntist Approach
first term marked a dramatic shift in the U.S.’s approach to international law.
Elected on an America First platform,
Trump adopted what scholars describe as a sovereigntist view, perceiving multilateral treaties as constraints on U.S. sovereignty.
manifested in a preference for bilateral agreements and scepticism towards multilateralism,
an approach more typical of emerging powers than an established superpower.
Weakening of Multilateral Organisations
During his first term,
Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,
reneged on nuclear agreements with Russia and Iran, and
undermined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) by blocking appointments to its Appellate Body.
These
actions weakened multilateral institutions
and signalled a retreat from global cooperation.
also withdrew the U.S. from international bodies like UNESCO, attempted to leave the World Health Organisation (WHO),
and dismantled agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Prospects for a Second Trump Term
Unilateralism Over Multilateralism
Central to Trump’s policy outlook is
his disdain for multilateral frameworks, which he perceives as constraints on American sovereignty.
view drives his preference for bilateral agreements
that allow the U.S. to negotiate from a position of strength, often disregarding broader international consensus.
For instance,
Trump’s first term saw the U.S. withdraw from landmark agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
These actions not only disrupted global efforts to address climate change and trade but also signalled a retreat from U.S. leadership in multilateral settings.
Protectionism and Economic Nationalism
Trump’s economic policies
reflect a clear preference for protectionism, with tariffs and trade restrictions forming the backbone of his strategy.
Trump imposed tariffs on allied nations such as Canada and Mexico,
citing unfair trade practices.
He also initiated trade wars with China,
disrupting global supply chains and straining economic relations.
In his second term, Trump has proposed even more aggressive measures
, including a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, even if it violates WTO rules.
Such policies could exacerbate tensions within the global trading system,
further undermining the already fragile World Trade Organisation.
Territorial Ambitions and Geopolitical Risks
Trump’s rhetoric surrounding territorial acquisitions
, such as annexing Greenland or the Panama Canal,
underscores a return to a revisionist approach reminiscent of 19th-century great-power politics.
While
such statements may not translate into immediate action, they challenge the post-World War II international consensus
that prohibits territorial conquest and prioritises self-determination.
ambitions also set a dangerous precedent for other revisionist states
, particularly China and Russia.
Erosion of Norms and Institutions
Trump’s second term
could further erode the normative authority of international institutions.
His administration’s
deliberate undermining of the WTO’s Appellate Body during his first term rendered it effectively non-functional
, and a renewed Trump presidency would likely continue such tactics.
Without a functioning dispute resolution mechanism, global trade could devolve into a series of unilateral actions and retaliatory measures
, eroding trust and predictability in international commerce.
Additionally,
Trump’s antagonism toward global governance mechanisms could weaken international cooperation on pressing issues such as climate change,
public health, and human rights.
The Path Forward to Countering these Challenges
While Trump’s first term faced resistance from domestic institutions and participants in the transnational legal process,
his renewed control over the Senate and House could enable him to implement his policies more effectively in a second term.
In this scenario,
other nations must collaborate to preserve the international legal order.
Strengthening multilateral institutions, developing global solidarity, and resisting the erosion of established norms will be essential
to counterbalance the unilateral tendencies of a Trump administration.
Conclusion
second term promises to deepen the challenges facing the international legal order.
His leadership style, marked by unilateralism and exceptionalism, risks undermining multilateral institutions
and destabilizing global norms.
To mitigate these effects,
the international community must remain vigilant
and proactive,
ensuring that the principles of international law continue to guide global governance.
Only through collective effort
can the integrity of
the international legal system be preserved in the face of such disruptions.

**********Time to Seize the Promise of the U.S.-India Nuclear Deal
Context
The
U.S.-India civil nuclear deal
, finalised in 2008,
stands as a landmark in international diplomacy
and strategic cooperation.
While the agreement paved the way for enhanced strategic and defence collaboration,
it fell short of fulfilling its energy and commercial potential.
With the onset of new US administration,
it is important to explore the historic significance, and the multifaceted challenges that have hindered the deal's full realisation,
alongside potential strategies to overcome them.
Historical Significance of US-India Civil Nuclear Deal: A New Era of Strategic Cooperation
The U.S.-India civil nuclear deal (2008)
marked a turning point in bilateral relations, particularly in defence and strategic domains.
Historically,
Cold War politics had estranged the two nations, but the nuclear agreement signalled a newfound trust.
By cooperating on nuclear technology, one of the most potent and potentially destructive advancements, the two nations laid the groundwork for deeper collaboration
in defence procurement, technology transfer, military exercises, and intelligence sharing.
Without this foundational trust,
the current level of interaction between the two countries would have been inconceivable.
Multifaceted Challenges Hindering the Deal's Full Realisation
Unfulfilled Energy and Commercial Promises
Despite the optimism surrounding the deal,
its energy and commercial goals remain largely unrealised.
Proponents envisioned a robust Indian civil nuclear sector powered by U.S. technology and equipment,
generating employment in both nations while providing clean energy for India's burgeoning population.
However,
the promise of six new nuclear plants announced in 2016 by President Barack Obama remains unfulfilled.
Clean energy from these plants was expected to reduce India's dependence on fossil fuels
, a significant contributor to climate change,
but bureaucratic and structural challenges have impeded progress.
Regulatory and Security Barriers
One of the initial hurdles to implementing the deal was
the inclusion of Indian entities on the U.S. Entity List, a trade restriction mechanism.
Although most entities were removed from the list following the deal,
a few remained due to concerns over dual-use technology potentially falling into adversarial hands.
Recently,
the Biden administration took steps to resolve these issues
, indicating progress.
such measures alone cannot address the core problems
that have obstructed the deal's full potential.
The Liability Risk Conundrum
major obstacle has been India's Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act of 2010,
which deviates from international norms by placing liability for nuclear accidents on suppliers rather than operators.
This liability framework, influenced by the Bhopal gas tragedy and associated anti-foreigner sentiment
, deterred U.S. suppliers like GE and Westinghouse from participating.
While the Indian government later introduced an insurance-based solution to mitigate supplier risks, it primarily benefited Russian suppliers
whose state-backed companies enjoyed sovereign immunity.
U.S. companies,
operating in a stricter legal and market environment,
remain reluctant to accept these terms.
Technological and Economic Challenges
Beyond liability issues,
technological and economic barriers further complicate U.S. involvement in India's civil nuclear sector.
rapidly evolving nature of nuclear technology necessitates that U.S. companies offer state-of-the-art solutions
at competitive prices.
cost overruns in U.S. nuclear projects have raised concerns
among Indian officials wary of burdening consumers with increased electricity rates.
Thus,
the challenge lies not only in providing advanced technology but also in ensuring its affordability and efficiency.
Potential Strategies to Overcome these Challenges
Resolving the Liability Issue
primary roadblock for U.S. companies is India's Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act,
which places undue risk on suppliers.
One possible solution involves revising the Act to align with international norms, such as those established by the Convention on Supplementary Compensation
for Nuclear Damage (CSC).
alignment would clarify the roles of operators and suppliers,
reducing the legal risks faced by the latter.
Alternatively,
India could expand its insurance-based mechanism by involving international insurers,
ensuring robust coverage for potential liabilities while reassuring suppliers of financial protection.
Enhancing Technological Collaboration
To compete effectively in India’s nuclear energy market,
U.S. companies must demonstrate their technological superiority while ensuring affordability.
Investing in joint research and development (R&D
) initiatives between
American and Indian institutions could lead to innovations tailored to India's unique energy demands.
For example,
small modular reactors (SMRs), which offer scalable and cost-effective solutions, could be a game-changer
for India’s energy landscape.
Moreover, the U.S. could facilitate technology transfers and capacity-building programs to empower Indian industries to locally manufacture critical components.
Addressing Cost and Consumer Concerns
For the Indian government, affordability is paramount.
Nuclear energy projects must be cost-competitive with other energy sources,
such as solar and wind, which have seen significant cost reductions in recent years.
To achieve this,
U.S. companies must streamline their project management processes, minimise delays, and prevent cost overruns.
U.S. and India could also explore innovative financing models,
such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and international funding from climate-related initiatives.
inclusion of green energy subsidies or low-interest loans could further enhance the financial viability
of nuclear projects.
Strengthening Policy and Regulatory Frameworks
A robust policy framework is critical to addressing lingering uncertainties.
two governments should establish a joint task force
dedicated to overcoming regulatory barriers and aligning export control systems.
task force could ensure that dual-use technologies are securely managed
while expediting approvals for nuclear energy projects.
Additionally,
bilateral agreements could focus on streamlining project implementation
timelines and ensuring transparency in procurement processes.
Deepening Strategic Partnerships
success of the nuclear deal should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a broader U.S.-India strategic partnership.
Enhanced cooperation in other areas,
such as renewable energy, defence, and space exploration, could complement nuclear energy initiatives.
Joint efforts to address global challenges, such as climate change and energy security, would strengthen bilateral ties and reinforce mutual trust.
Conclusion
The U.S.-India civil nuclear deal remains a testament to the transformative power of diplomacy,
yet its potential remains largely untapped.
While it has significantly enhanced strategic cooperation between the two nations,
its energy and commercial promises are yet to be realised.
Addressing regulatory, liability, technological, and economic challenges will require
concerted efforts from both governments and private entities.
stakes are high, but so are the potential rewards
, clean energy, economic growth, and stronger bilateral ties.
