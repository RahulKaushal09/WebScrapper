PRADHAN MANTRI SCHOOLS FOR RISING INDIA (PM-SHRI)
Context:
After Punjab, the AAP government in Delhi has also relented under financial pressure and agreed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Centre to implement the Pradhan Mantri Schools for Rising India (PM-SHRI) scheme in the Capital.
The Education Ministry had stopped funds under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), the flagship school education programme, to three Opposition-ruled states — Delhi, Punjab and West Bengal — due to their reluctance to participate in the PM-SHRI scheme.
About PM- SHRI Scheme
The PM SHRI is a centrally sponsored scheme initiated by the Government of India.
Its objective is to establish over 14,500 PM SHRI Schools, overseen by the Central Government, State/UT Governments, local bodies, as well as Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS).
These schools aim to create an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere for every student, ensuring their well-being and providing a secure and enriching learning environment.
The goal is to offer a diverse range of learning experiences and ensure access to good physical infrastructure and appropriate resources for all students.
These schools will not only focus on enhancing cognitive development but also creating holistic and well-rounded individuals equipped with key 21st-century skills.
The pedagogy adopted in these schools will be more experiential, holistic, integrated, play/toy-based (particularly in the foundational years), inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and enjoyable.
The focus will be on the learning outcomes of every child in every grade. Assessment at all levels will be based on conceptual understanding and application of knowledge to real-life situations and will be competency-based.
PM SHRI Schools will help showcase the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020 and emerge as exemplar Schools over a period of time.
Current issue
States must confirm their participation in PM SHRI by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Education Ministry.
Five states — Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Delhi, Punjab and West Bengal — are yet to sign the MoU. While Tamil Nadu and Kerala have indicated their willingness, Delhi, Punjab and West Bengal had earlier refused, prompting the Centre to stop their SSA funds.
The AAP-ruled Punjab and Delhi had held out over the implementation of PM-SHRI saying they have their own schemes along similar lines, called Schools of Specialised Excellence in Delhi and Schools of Eminence in Punjab. Both had not received crores worth of SSA funds.
Punjab was the first to end the logjam on July 26 when Punjab Education Secretary wrote to Union Education Secretary, expressing willingness to implement the scheme in the state.
On September 2, Delhi also relented. Its Secretary (Education) has written saying that Delhi is interested in signing the MoU for establishing PM-SHRI schools in Delhi.
With this, West Bengal is now the only state holding out on the implementation of the scheme. The state opposes prefixing ‘PM-SHRI’ to the names of its schools, especially since it bears 40% of the cost.

INDIA’S STEEL SECTOR
: GS 3
Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal recently asked the steel industry to target 500 million tonnes steel production by 2034.
The steel industry in India dates back to the early 20th century, with the establishment of Tata Steel in 1907, which was the first integrated steel plant in Asia. Post-independence, the sector grew with the establishment of public sector steel plants. Since the liberalization of the 1990s, there has been significant private sector investment.
Indias Global Standing:
India is the second-largest producer of steel in the world, after China.
In recent years, India’s steel production has exceeded 120 million tonnes per year (2022).
Structure and Capacity of the Industry:
Integrated Steel Plants (ISPs): These are large steel plants that produce steel from iron ore using blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces (BOF). ISPs generally have full-scale operations from raw material processing to finished steel products. Major ISPs include SAIL, Tata Steel, JSW Steel, and JSPL.
Mini Steel Plants: These are smaller plants that primarily produce steel by recycling scrap metal in electric arc furnaces (EAF) or induction furnaces (IF). Mini steel plants cater to the demand for long steel products used in construction and local markets.
Contribution to the Economy:
GDP Contribution: The steel sector contributes about 2% to 3% of India’s GDP. It is a core industry that has a multiplier effect on other sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and transportation.
Employment: The sector provides direct and indirect employment to millions of people, including those involved in raw material extraction, steel production, and downstream industries.
Exports: India is a significant exporter of steel, with major markets in Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. India also imports certain types of steel, especially specialized steel that is not produced domestically in sufficient quantities.
Recent Trends and Developments:
Growth in Capacity: India’s steel production capacity has increased significantly in recent years, and the country aims to reach a capacity of 300 million tonnes by 2030, according to the National Steel Policy 2017.
National Steel Policy 2017: This policy aims to encourage the domestic steel industry to become self-reliant and globally competitive. Goals include increasing per capita steel consumption to 160 kg by 2030-31 (from about 74 kg currently), making India a global hub for steel production and exports, and promoting environmentally sustainable practices.
Infrastructure Push: The Indian government’s focus on infrastructure development, including roads, railways, airports, and smart cities, has boosted demand for steel.
As global demand for eco-friendly and low-carbon steel grows, Indian steelmakers are exploring green steel production methods, including hydrogen-based steelmaking, reducing emissions, and increasing the use of scrap metal.
Raw Material Supply: While India has abundant iron ore, it relies heavily on imported coking coal, making the sector vulnerable to global price fluctuations.
Environmental Concerns: Steel production is energy-intensive and generates significant emissions, leading to pressures to adopt cleaner technologies.
Competition: Indian steelmakers face competition from global producers, particularly Chinese steelmakers who dominate the global market.

**********Responsible use of Artificial Intelligence in war
Background:
As military use of
artificial intelligence (AI)
expands, efforts to regulate its application in warfare are also intensifying. Conflicts like those in
Ukraine and Gaza
are becoming testing grounds for AI in combat.
India, despite its active role in promoting the development and safe use of AI in the civilian sector, has been largely absent from the global discussion on restricting its military applications. As international frameworks for
AI arms control
begin to take shape, it is crucial for India to engage and influence these discussions rather than remain on the sidelines.
What’s in today’s article?
Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain (REAIM)
The AI Debate in Warfare
Stand of India, China, US and UN on AI use in weapons
About the summit
The Summit on Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain (REAIM) is part of a growing global effort to establish norms for AI's military applications.
This is the
second iteration of the summit
. It
begins on September 9 in
Seoul
, co-hosted by Kenya, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.
Objectives of the Korea Summit
The second REAIM summit in South Korea aims to build on the progress from the first summit and achieve a three-fold objective:
Understand the implications of military AI on global peace and security.
Implement new norms for using AI systems in military affairs.
Develop ideas for long-term global governance of AI in the military domain.
Outcome of the first summit
The first summit, held in February 2023 in The Hague, broadened the debate on military AI, focusing on issues like autonomous weapons or "killer robots."
A key concern is keeping humans in the decision-making loop on the use of force.
Discussions on lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) have been ongoing at the United Nations since 2019.
Increased use of AI in warfare
REAIM process
has broadened the discussion on military AI beyond just "killer robots" to recognize the increasing role of AI in various aspects of warfare.
While AI has long been used for tasks like inventory management and logistical planning, its application in
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) on the battlefield has significantly grown in recent years.
Leading militaries are now leveraging AI to process vast amounts of data, enhance
situational awareness
, speed up
on the use of force, improve
precision in targeting
, limit civilian casualties, and increase the overall tempo of warfare.
Concerns Over AI in Warfare
Despite these perceived benefits, many critics caution that the allure of AI in warfare could be illusory and dangerous.
The rise of AI decision-making support systems (AI-DSS) is a critical area of debate under the REAIM process, with concerns over the risks and ethical implications of relying on AI for battlefield decisions.
Promoting responsible use of AI in military affairs
The REAIM process has shifted
its focus from trying to reverse the AI revolution in military affairs to advocating for the responsible use of AI in warfare
It is part of several global efforts—national, bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral—aimed at promoting responsible AI.
At the end of the Hague summit, the United States issued a draft political declaration on responsible AI use, formalizing it in November 2023.
In 2020, the US had already released national guidelines for the military use of AI and has encouraged NATO allies to adopt similar standards.
NATO's 2021 strategy identified six principles for responsible AI use in military settings and released corresponding guidelines in July 2023
, aiming to accelerate AI deployment in warfare while ensuring safety and responsibility.
As part of this effort,
the US is also conducting a bilateral dialogue with China to discuss limiting AI’s impact on nuclear deterrence
US introduced resolution at the UNGA
introduced a resolution on the
UN General Assembly (UNGA)
, co-sponsored by 123 countries and adopted by consensus.
While the UN's focus is broad, the REAIM process fosters more detailed discussions on military AI and aims to build a wide international coalition to establish new global norms.
Over 50 countries have endorsed the US's
on responsible AI use in the military, and the US is reaching out to
Global South
countries for support.
India’s stand
India has taken a 'watch-and-wait' approach to this debate, carefully evaluating the long-term significance of these developments without fully committing to the new AI initiatives.
It did not endorse the “call to action” at The Hague summit and may or may not support the global AI blueprint expected at the Korea summit
However, India risks being left behind if it remains passive in shaping these crucial norms.
India’s negative experience with nuclear arms control, where hesitation cost it the opportunity to shape global rules, serves as a reminder that it’s easier to influence
during the
design phase
rather than trying to change them after they are established.
Stand of China
has been proactive, engaging in both strategic and regulatory discussions on military AI.
China talks about
"intelligised warfare"
and released a White Paper on military AI regulation in 2021. It also supported the
Hague summit’s call to action

**********Plastic Pollution in India
Why in News?
According to a new study, India has secured the top spot as the biggest plastic polluter in the world.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What are the Findings of the Study About Plastic Pollution?
Effort to Regulate Plastic Use
Highlights:
The study assesses five sources of plastic pollution:
uncollected waste, littering, collection systems, uncontrolled disposal, and rejects from sorting and reprocessing.
The findings reveal that
global plastic waste emissions
reached 52.1 million tonnes (Mt) in 2020.
Notably, 69% of global plastic waste emissions
originate from 20 countries, including 4 low-income, 9 lower-middle-income, and 7 upper-middle-income nations.
Littering was the predominant source of emissions
in the Global North, while
was the major source in the Global South.
High-income countries
, despite having higher plastic waste generation rates, are not in the top 90 polluters due to their comprehensive waste collection and controlled disposal systems.
Case of India:
India has emerged as the world's top plastic polluter,
releasing 9.3 Mt of plastic annually
amounting to roughly one-fifth of global plastic emissions.
Plastic emissions are greenhouse gases (GHGs) released throughout the life cycle of plastic, from production to disposal.
While India’s official plastic waste generation rate (which is about 0.12 kilograms per capita per day) is likely underestimated, waste collection figures are inflated.
This discrepancy
may stem from the exclusion of data from rural areas, the open burning of uncollected waste, and waste recycled by the informal sector.
Case of other countries:
After India, it’s
Nigeria and Indonesia
that hold the 2nd and 3rd position in the plastic emissions, with 3.5 Mt and 3.4 Mt, respectively.
China,
which was identified as the top global polluter, has dropped to 4th position, mainly due to progress in waste management, including investments in incineration and controlled landfills over the past 15 years.
Significance of the study:
These insights are crucial for the upcoming
Global Plastics Treaty
, which aims to create a legally binding agreement on plastic pollution by 2024.
offer a new baseline
for countries to assess and address their plastic pollution, helping shape future action plans and improve waste management strategies.
Concerns regarding study:
This comprehensive study may still underestimate emissions from some high-income countries as it
excluded plastic waste exports
Effort to Regulate Plastic Use:
India - The Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules (2021):
In 2022
, India brought into effect the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules (2021) that banned 19 categories of
‘single-use plastics’
- disposable goods that are made with plastic but are
generally use-and-throw
Global:
Resolution to end plastic pollution:
The United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) passed a resolution to “end plastic pollution” in 2022.
An Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC)
was set up and tasked to develop a legally binding instrument - a global treaty - to govern plastic production and use across all nations.
Global Plastics Treaty:
In 2022, 175 nations agreed to develop a legally binding agreement on plastic pollution by 2024 to reduce GHG emissions from plastic production, use and disposal.
However, after multiple rounds of extensive discussions and negotiations,
the world seems to be nowhere near an agreement on how to deal with the plastic waste menace

**********Musharraf’s ancestral land in UP to be auctioned under Enemy Property Act
Why in news?
The Indian government is set to auction a parcel of land in Uttar Pradesh that once belonged to the family of former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. The land, measuring around 13 bighas in the Kotana Bangar village of Baghpat district, is being sold under
The Enemy Property Act
In this regard, the Union Home Ministry has posted a notice on the land.
What’s in today’s article?
Laws dealing with enemy property in India
Court orders on the issue of enemy properties
About
Enemy property is property left behind by the people who migrated to enemy countries.
Under
, properties belonging to individuals who migrated to enemy countries (such as Pakistan or China) after wars in 1947, 1965, and 1971 are seized by the Indian government.
The Act ruled that the heirs of people who migrated to Pakistan and China would not have any right to succession over the property left by their ancestors.
These properties are managed by the
Custodian of Enemy Property
and can be sold by the government as per legal provisions.
Background
Following the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, many people migrated from India to Pakistan,
leading the Indian government to seize their properties under the Defence of India Rules (framed under the Defence of India Act, 1962
).
These properties were handed over to the Custodian of Enemy Property for India.
Similar action was taken for properties left behind by those who moved to China after the 1962 Sino-Indian War.
The Tashkent Declaration of January 1966 included a provision for India and Pakistan to discuss the return of such properties.
However, Pakistan sold off these properties in 1971, leaving the issue unresolved.
Enemy property in India - Statistics
Apart from the company shares, most enemy property is in the form of land and buildings.
There are 13,252 enemy properties in India, valued at over Rs1 lakh crore.
Most of these properties belong to people who migrated to Pakistan, and over 100 to those who migrated to China.
(5,982) has the highest number of enemy properties, followed by West Bengal (4,354).
The central government launched a survey in the past year to further identify and monetize these properties. Many of these properties have gone under encroachment and unauthorised occupancy.
Enemy Property Act of 1968
This act ensured that properties of individuals or firms from enemy nations remained vested with the
The government owns enemy properties across various states, such as in Karnataka, where six prime properties in Bengaluru are valued at approximately ₹500 crore.
Amendment introduced in 2016
In 2017, Parliament passed the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Bill, 2016.
This bill updated the 1968 Act and the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971.
This amendment
broadened the definition of "enemy subject" and "enemy firm"
to include legal heirs and successors, even if they are Indian citizens or citizens of non-enemy countries
The amended law states that enemy property continues to vest in the Custodian even after the enemy’s death, change of nationality, or other status changes.
The Custodian can sell these properties with government approval, and the central government can direct the Custodian on how to manage and dispose of them.
Need for such amendments
The amendments to the Enemy Property Act were introduced to prevent claims of succession or transfer of properties left by individuals who migrated to Pakistan and China after the wars.
primary goal was to counter a court ruling that undermined the Custodian's authority
The statement of objects and reasons in the Bill explained that various court judgments had weakened the Custodian's powers, making it difficult for the Custodian to act under the original 1968 Act.
Significant legal case regarding enemy property
A significant legal case regarding enemy property involved the estate of the
erstwhile Raja of Mahmudabad
in Uttar Pradesh.
The Raja moved to Pakistan in 1957, becoming a Pakistani citizen, while his wife and son,
Mohammed Amir Mohammad Khan
, remained Indian citizens.
Under the
, the Raja’s estate, which included valuable properties in Hazratganj, Sitapur, and Nainital, was classified as enemy property.
SC Judgement
After the Raja’s death, his son claimed the properties, and
in 2005, the
Supreme Court
ruled in his favor.
This verdict led to a surge of claims from relatives of people who migrated to Pakistan, presenting deeds of gift to reclaim enemy properties.
Ordinance introduced in 2010
To counter this, the
UPA government
issued an
in 2010 that blocked courts from ordering the release of enemy properties.
This nullified the 2005 Supreme Court ruling, and the Custodian regained control of the Raja's estate.
A Bill was introduced in Parliament but lapsed.
Eventually, the
Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 2016
was promulgated and replaced by a Bill that became law in 2017, reinforcing government control over enemy properties.

**********Uncommon Cyclones in the Arabian Sea
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Indian Ocean (Uniqueness, Monsoon Influence, Cyclogenesis, Global Warming, Case Study on Asna Cyclone, etc.)
Background:
The North Indian Ocean plays a crucial role in influencing India’s weather patterns, especially during the summer monsoon.
It supplies a significant amount of moisture, which is critical for the monsoon rains.
Despite this, the region experiences fewer cyclones compared to other oceanic basins globally.
This article analyzes the unique nature of the North Indian Ocean, how climate change is impacting it, and the recent developments concerning cyclones in the region.
Why is the Indian Ocean Unique?
The Indian Ocean stands out due to its complex climate interactions. It is connected to both the Pacific and Southern Oceans through "
oceanic tunnels
".
The Pacific Ocean brings warm water into the Indian Ocean, while the Southern Ocean brings cooler water.
This unique combination leads to varied sea temperatures, which in turn impact monsoon winds and cyclogenesis (the formation of cyclones).
Monsoonal Influence on Cyclogenesis:
Bay of Bengal
, both parts of the Indian Ocean, warm up significantly before the monsoon.
The Bay of Bengal, in particular, becomes a hotbed for atmospheric convection, which leads to rainfall and low-pressure systems.
These systems, however, rarely turn into cyclones because of a phenomenon known as "
vertical shear
This shear strips cyclones of their energy, especially during the monsoon season.
Impact of Climate Change on the Indian Ocean:
Climate change is significantly altering the Indian Ocean’s dynamics.
Increased warming from the Pacific Ocean and changes in atmospheric conditions are causing rapid warming of the Indian Ocean itself.
This warming is influencing the monsoon and leading to new challenges in terms of
and extreme weather events.
Cyclogenesis refers to the process of cyclone formation and intensification, which occurs when favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions come together.
The Role of the Indian Ocean in Global Warming:
The Indian Ocean acts as a clearinghouse for global ocean warming, impacting other oceans like the Pacific and the North Atlantic.
As the Indian Ocean warms, it alters global ocean currents and affects climate patterns across the world.
This has had a direct impact on cyclogenesis, contributing to the increasing unpredictability of cyclones in the region.
Cyclone Seasons in the North Indian Ocean:
North Indian Ocean is
unique in that it has two distinct cyclone seasons, one
one after
, unlike other regions of the world, which typically experience only one cyclone season.
During the pre-monsoon season, the Arabian Sea experiences less cyclone activity due to cooler sea temperatures and limited convection.
On the other hand, the
Bay of Bengal remains more active during both seasons
Cyclones in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal:
The Arabian Sea sees fewer cyclones compared to the Bay of Bengal.
This is due to lower convective activity, stronger wind shear, and cooler sea temperatures, especially after the monsoon season.
While the number of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal has remained relatively stable, the
Arabian Sea has seen a slight increase in cyclone activity since 2010, although it has been calm in recent years
Cyclone Asna:
It was an unusual cyclone that formed in August 2023, marking the
first North Indian Ocean cyclone in August since 1981
What made it particularly unusual was that it originated from a land-based low-pressure system.
Such systems typically form over the Bay of Bengal and bring heavy monsoon rains to India.
However, this particular system transitioned into a full-fledged cyclone after moving into the Arabian Sea.
Unusual Nature of Asna:
The transition of this low-pressure system into a cyclone over land and its subsequent growth over the Arabian Sea was unexpected.
The warming Arabian Sea, fueled by global warming and regional weather patterns, provided the necessary energy for Asna to intensify.
However, it eventually dissipated due to dry desert air entering the cyclone’s circulation.
The Broader Impact of Climate Change on Cyclones:
Climate change is making cyclones in the Indian Ocean more unpredictable.
Factors such as global warming, El Niño, and even underwater volcanic eruptions have contributed to extreme weather events worldwide, including India.
The monsoon season has also become increasingly erratic, with unpredictable rainfall patterns across the country.
Conclusion:
The Indian Ocean is at the center of many climate change-driven phenomena, especially concerning cyclones.
While the region remains less prone to cyclones compared to other parts of the world, the increasing unpredictability of these storms, driven by climate change, presents significant challenges for India and its neighbors.
As climate change continues to affect global weather patterns, understanding and predicting these changes will be crucial for mitigating their impacts on vulnerable populations.
