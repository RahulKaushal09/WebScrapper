**********Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court recently heard arguments on whether courts can modify an arbitral award under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996.
About Arbitration and Conciliation Act:
It established a sound
framework for alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in India.
The act updated and codified the laws about arbitration, mediation, and conciliation.
It is vital for businesses and individuals alike; it allows them to have an easier, less adversarial, and less costly mode of dispute resolution as compared to those conducted outside traditional courts.
Features of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act:
Two-tiered system
: It offers arbitration and conciliation and thus differences in modes of conflict resolution.
Flexibility:
Parties can choose their rules of procedure and arbitrators for flexibility and convenience.
Confidentiality:
Confidentiality in the proceedings is required; it is important in cases of business disputes regarding issues that cannot easily be revealed.
Finality and Enforceability:
Arbitration awards become binding and enforceable by courts, so parties must adhere to them.
Judicial Support and Limited Intervention:
Courts could intervene under certain cases, which include the appointment of arbitrators or the enforcement of the award.
Global Applicability:
In regard to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law, it is globally compatible, and therefore this act helps in international arbitration.
Major Provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act:
Arbitration Agreement:
An arbitration agreement refers to a written undertaking between parties to have their disputes arbitrarily determined, thereby paving the way for arbitration proceedings to be given the go-ahead.
Appointment of Arbitrators:
The appointment of arbitrators is at the
discretion of the parties,
but courts take action if the parties cannot agree on the appointment. The provision would promote self-regulation while providing judicial support when needed.
Interim Measures by Courts:
Gives courts the authority to
issue interim relief before arbitration starts.
This will prevent cases where parties may lose their assets before the case is settled.
Arbitral Proceedings:
Provides that parties can agree on procedures or adopt institutional rules, which promotes
procedural autonomy.
Forms and Contents of Arbitral Award:
Requires
awards to be in writing, dated, signed by arbitrators,
and reasons given, unless parties agree otherwise. The award pronounced becomes binding.
Setting Aside an Arbitral Award:
Goes on to detail when the
court shall set aside the award.
The basis includes either the party's incapacity or an invalid agreement.
Appeals:
limited grounds on appeal
so that awards are substantially final and enforceable and sets a limit to risk-prolonged litigation.
Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act:
Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015:
Introduced timelines
for the institution of
arbitral proceedings
so that it is completed within
12 months.
Judicial interferenc
e has been c
urtailed to an extent to bring finality to arbitration.
Cost control regulations
have been enhanced to make ADR cost-effective.
Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019:
It has established the
Arbitration Council of India (ACI)
regulate arbitration standards
and promote institutional arbitration.
Disclosure of
the existence of
conflicts of interest by the arbitrator i
s made
mandatory
, thereby increasing transparency.
Focused on reducing delays by limiting stay orders on arbitral awards.
Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021:
Done away with automatic stays on arbitral awards
for reasons such as fraud or corruption.
Streamlined the process of enforcing arbitral awards, thereby endorsing a pro-enforcement approach in this manner of the Act.

**********Soil Health Card Scheme
Recently, the soil health card scheme has completed its decade.
About Soil Health Card Scheme:
The soil health card scheme was launched in 2015 to assist State Governments to issue soil health cards to
all farmers.
It provides
information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrients
to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility.
Key features:
It contains status of the soil with respect to
12 parameters, namely N, P, K, S (Macro-nutrients); Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Bo (Micro - nutrients); and pH (Acidity or Basicity), EC (Electrical Conductivity) and OC (Organic Carbon).
Soil samples are taken
generally two times in a year
, after harvesting of Rabi and Kharif Crop respectively or when there is no standing crop in the field.
A farmer will get the soil card
once in every 3 years.
Village Level Soil Testing Labs
can be set up to provide test results by individual entrepreneurs i.e. rural youth and community based entrepreneurs, including Self Help Groups (SHGs), Schools, Agriculture Universities etc.
Soil Health Card scheme has been
merged in Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) scheme as one of its components
under the name ‘Soil Health & Fertility’ from the year 2022-23.
Technological Advancements:
To streamline the implementation/monitoring of the scheme and to provide easy access to Soil Health Card to the farmers
, SHC Mobile App has been built with additional features.
Benefits:
The scheme monitors the soil of the farmers well and gives them a formatted report. So, they can
decide well which crops they should cultivate and which ones they should skip.
The authorities monitor the soil on a regular basis. One in every 3 years, they provide a report to farmers. So farmers need not worry if the nature of the soil changes due to certain factors. Also, they always have updated data about their soil.

**********India to Submit Updated Greenhouse Gas Inventory to UN
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, About BTR)
Key Findings from Previous Report (Significance, Challenges, Contributions, etc.)
Introduction:
India is in the final stages of preparing its
first-ever Biennial Transparency Report (BTR)
as part of its commitments under the
2015 Paris Agreement
The
Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)
will submit the report to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
The BTR will include data up to 2022 and will be subject to independent expert review.
This submission marks a significant step toward
enhancing transparency in India’s climate actions
and reporting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accurately.
About the Biennial Transparency Report (BTR):
BTR is an official document
that provides details on:
India’s greenhouse gas emissions inventory
(sectors and sources of emissions).
Efforts to improve energy efficiency
and shift to
renewable energy sources
Availability of resources
for climate action.
While India has previously submitted
National Communications and Biennial Update Reports (BURs)
, the
BTR is unique
because it undergoes
technical review by UNFCCC-accredited experts
Significance:
Commitment to the Paris Agreement
– The Paris Agreement mandates countries to report on their climate action efforts, and BTR is a step toward fulfilling these commitments.
Greater Transparency
– Unlike BURs, which are internally reviewed, BTRs undergo
external technical scrutiny
, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
Reflecting Post-COVID Emission Trends
– India’s previous BUR (submitted in December 2024) contained data up to 2020, showing a
7.93% drop in emissions due to COVID-19 lockdowns
. The upcoming
BTR is expected to show a rise in emissions
as economic activities resumed.
Key Findings from India’s Previous Greenhouse Gas Report:
According to India’s last
BUR for 2020
, key insights included:
Total greenhouse gas emissions (excluding forestry & land use change):
2,959 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e).
Net emissions (including forestry & land use change):
2,437 million tonnes of CO₂e.
Sector-wise emissions breakdown:
Energy sector:
75.66%
Agriculture:
13.72%
Industrial processes & product use:
8.06%
Waste sector:
2.56%
Additionally, India's
forest and tree cover helped sequester 522 million tonnes of CO₂
, reducing total carbon emissions by
22%
Challenges in Preparing the Greenhouse Gas Inventory:
The preparation of the
BTR is a complex process
involving multiple
government agencies, research institutions, and private organizations
. Some challenges include:
Collecting accurate and updated data
across different sectors.
Ensuring consistency with international reporting standards
under UNFCCC.
Addressing post-pandemic fluctuations
in emissions trends.
India’s Global Emissions Contribution:
India’s total GHG emissions account for 4-5% of global emissions.
India’s per capita emissions are less than one-third of the global average.
These statistics highlight that while India is among the largest emitters, its
per capita emissions remain significantly low
, reinforcing its stance on
fair and equitable climate responsibility
Future Outlook: India’s Climate Action Plan -
India is actively working toward its
climate goals
, including:
Achieving Net Zero by 2070
– A long-term commitment made at COP26.
Expanding Renewable Energy Capacity
– India aims for
500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy by 2030
Enhancing Carbon Sequestration
– Increasing forest cover and promoting sustainable land-use practices.
Conclusion:
first BTR
is a crucial step toward
strengthening its global climate commitments
By providing
detailed and transparent data on emissions and mitigation efforts
, India aims to align with
international climate action frameworks
. While challenges remain in data collection and accuracy, the submission of the BTR will
enhance India’s credibility in climate negotiations and contribute to informed policymaking

**********Appointment of Gyanesh Kumar as Chief Election Commissioner - Key Changes and Controversy
Why in News?
Former IAS officer
has been appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) of India,
succeeding Rajiv Kumar
.
The appointment was made by a
Selection Committee
comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and Leader of Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi.
The process has sparked controversy due to
opposition objections and pending Supreme Court cases.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Evolution of the Appointment Process of CEC
LoP’s Dissent and Supreme Court Challenge
Why was the Appointment Process Changed?
Implications and Unresolved Issues
Conclusion
Evolution of the Appointment Process of CEC:
Previous system of appointment:
The Election Commission of India (ECI) comprises
a CEC and two Election Commissioners (ECs).
Earlier
, there was no law passed by Parliament for the appointment of the CEC and ECs. The President appointed the CEC on the advice of the Prime Minister.
Traditionally
, the senior-most Election Commissioner was elevated to CEC.
Seniority
was determined based on the order of appointment notification.
The new appointment process:
Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023
governs appointments now.
The process involves
two stages:
The Search Committee
(headed by the Law Minister) shortlists five names.
The Selection Committee
(PM, Leader of the Opposition [LoP], and a Union Minister) chooses the final candidate.
officially appoints the CEC based on this recommendation.
Eligibility and tenure under the new law:
The new law sets
specific eligibility criteria:
Candidates must have held the rank of Secretary to the Government of India.
Must have integrity and experience in election management.
Terms of service:
CEC and ECs are
not eligible for reappointment
The total tenure cannot exceed
six years
(including service as EC and CEC).
LoP’s Dissent and Supreme Court Challenge:
LoP submitted a dissent note
requesting a deferral of the appointment until the Supreme Court rules
on petitions challenging the new process.
The key challenge
is the removal of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) from the Selection Committee.
The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has petitioned the Supreme Court against this change.
The Supreme Court is set to hear the case on February 19, 2025, a day after Rajiv Kumar’s retirement.
had ruled in March 2023 that CEC and ECs should be selected by a committee comprising:
The Prime Minister
The Leader of the Opposition
The Chief Justice of India
Before implementing this, the government passed the
new Act
replacing the CJI with a Union Cabinet Minister
(to be nominated by the PM), effectively
giving the Executive more control
Implications and Unresolved Issues:
Pending SC case:
The Court may rule on whether Parliament can override a Constitution Bench judgment through legislation.
Political debate:
The opposition argues the government now has disproportionate control over the Election Commission.
Impact on future elections:
The legitimacy of the new selection process may influence public trust in the Election Commission’s independence.
Conclusion:
The appointment of Gyanesh Kumar as CEC marks the
first implementation of the 2023 Act
.  However, with a Supreme Court verdict pending, the
debate over the independence and transparency
of the Election Commission
remains unresolved

**********The Deeper Meaning of Declining School Enrolment
Context
India, the world’s most populous country
, has long held hopes of reaping a demographic dividend,
sustained by its burgeoning youth population.
For decades,
demographers and policy planners have anticipated that this window of opportunity,
where the working-age population significantly outnumbers dependents, would remain open for a limited time.
However,
recent trends suggest that this demographic advantage may be short-lived
Declining school enrolment rates over the past decade
signal the beginning of the end of this period, suggesting that India may age before it becomes wealthy.
The Data Behind the Decline
Ministry of Education’s release of the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (U-DISE+) data
for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years raised alarms.
The data revealed a
15
5 million decrease in school enrolment
since the 2018-19 academic year, a 6% drop that has caused considerable concern.
Official sources
attributed this decline to improvements in data collection
, particularly the integration of Aadhaar numbers to prevent multiple school enrolments.
While this explanation may seem plausible,
a deeper analysis of enrolment data
spanning the past decade
paints a far more troubling picture.
decline is not merely a result of more accurate data
; it reflects a
systematic demographic shift.
Over the past ten years,
school enrolment has dropped by 24.51 million
, or 9.45%. Elementary education, which has been free and compulsory under the Right to Education (RTE) Act since 2009, has seen a particularly sharp decline of 18.7 million (13.45%).
Conversely,
senior secondary enrolment has increased
, reflecting a shift in the educational landscape,
but the overall trend points to a demographic transition
that signals an end to the country’s demographic dividend.
The Role of Government and Private Schools, Demographic Trends and Their Impact on Enrolment
closer look at the enrolment figures
across different school types
further illustrates the scope of the issue.
Government and government-aided schools
, which serve more than 65% of the population, have
experienced the largest declines.
Enrolment in government schools dropped by 19.89 million (13.8%
), and in government-aided schools, by 4.95 million (16.41%).
This
decline has been especially acute at the elementary level, with government schools losing 21.78 million (18.31%) enrollees
and government-aided schools losing 3.85 million (24.34%).
Private unaided schools have bucked the trend,
registering a modest increase in total
enrolment by 1.61 million (2.03%).
this growth has been concentrated in senior secondary levels
, where enrolment
increased by 1.41 million (15.55%).
Although private schools have seen some growth,
they too are not immune to the broader demographic shifts
impacting India’s educational landscape.
The decline in school enrolment is
closely tied to demographic changes.
Over the past decade, the
school-going population in the age group of 6-17 years has decreased by 17.3 million (5.78%).
Notably,
the population of children in the 6-13 and 14-15 age groups
, which are critical to elementary and secondary school enrolment,
has also shrunk by 18.7 million (9.12%) and 2.17 million (4.35%), respectively.
correlation between the decreasing school-age population and the declining enrolment is stark
, with demographic factors explaining 60.36% of the drop in school enrolment.
The trend is further corroborated by the reduction in the number of schools across the country.
From 1.55 million schools in 2017-18
, the number has
dropped to 1.47 million in 2023-24,
a decrease of 5.1%.
This reflects the country’s declining fertility rate, which stood at 2.01 in 2022, below the replacement level of 2.10, indicating that India’s population growth is slowing.
The Social and Economic Implications
The shrinking school enrolment figures
point to a broader demographic shift in India.
country is experiencing a transition
where the youthful population bulge is gradually shifting to older age groups, with fewer children entering the school system.
shift will soon affect not only elementary and secondary education but also higher education
, as fewer young people enter the workforce.
India’s experience mirrors that of
many developed nations, where a shrinking working-age population poses significant economic challenges.
As India faces the transition
to a shrinking workforce, the
consequences of this demographic shift will be felt across all sectors.
demographic dividend, which has been critical in driving India’s economic growth
, may soon fade.
This will
leave the country with an aging population before it has had a chance to achieve the wealth and prosperity
typically associated with a demographic dividend.
Conclusion
India’s declining school enrolment is not merely a result of improved data collection methods
; it is indicative of
a more profound demographic change
- The country is nearing the end of its window to capitalise on its youth population.
Unless the forthcoming Census reveals a different demographic trend,
India’s demographic dividend may have already peaked.
With a shrinking youth population and a decline in school enrolment,
India faces the challenge of preparing for an aging population at a time when it has yet to fully realise its economic potential.
The coming years will be crucial as India grapples with the reality of an aging society and the social and economic consequences that will follow.

7.8 on the Richter scale struck Türkiye and Syria, leaving at least 17,000 dead
and many more injured.
destruction was compounded by a second tremor nine hours later
, causing further devastation.
This
catastrophe served as a grim reminder of the unpredictable nature of earthquakes
and the vulnerability of human settlements built along fault lines.
More recently,
on January 7, 2025, an earthquake measuring 7.1 struck the Tibet Autonomous Region, affecting Nepal and northern India.
These events highlight the fact that earthquakes are not confined to specific regions but can have widespread consequences.
The Underlying Geological Reasons
The Collision of the Indian and Eurasian Plates
One of the most seismically active regions in the world is the
boundary where the Indian Plate meets the Eurasian Plate.
Indian Plate is gradually moving northward at a rate of approximately 5 cm per year,
pushing against the massive Eurasian Plate.
slow yet relentless collision has been ongoing for millions of years
, giving rise to the Himalayan mountain range,
the world’s youngest and most tectonically unstable mountain system
. However, this process is far from over.
immense pressure generated by this collision continues to accumulate,
increasing the likelihood of future earthquakes.
Seismologists have long warned that
the tectonic stress along this boundary has reached critical levels.
means that at any moment, a significant rupture could occur, triggering a devastating earthquake
The region has already witnessed several major seismic events in the past, including:
1934 Bihar-Nepal Earthquake
(Mw 8.0), which caused widespread destruction and killed over 10,000 people.
2005 Kashmir Earthquake
(Mw 7.6), which struck northern Pakistan and India, killing over 87,000 people.
2015 Nepal Earthquake
(Mw 7.8), which resulted in the deaths of nearly 9,000 people and the destruction of thousands of historical structures.
The Role of Fault Lines in Seismic Activity
Himalayan region is riddled with fault lines
, fractures in the Earth's crust where tectonic stress accumulates.
faults remain inactive for decades or even centuries
, lulling people into a false sense of security.
when the stress exceeds the strength of the rock formations
holding the fault together,
a sudden slip occurs, causing an earthquake
Some of the major fault lines in the region include:
Main Frontal Thrust (MFT)
– A major fault that runs along the foothills of the Himalayas, responsible for many of the region's most destructive earthquakes.
Main Boundary Thrust (MBT)
– Located further north, this fault also plays a significant role in shaping seismic activity.
Main Central Thrust (MCT)
– A deep-seated fault that accommodates the continued movement of the Indian Plate under the Himalayas.
The Growing Risk, Future Predictions and The Overlooked Danger
The Growing Risk and Future Predictions
What makes the current situation particularly alarming is that
the Indian and Eurasian Plates have been in a state of relative quiet for a long time,
meaning the stored energy within the faults has been increasing.
Seismologists believe that a major rupture could be imminent
, releasing this pent-up energy in the form of a powerful earthquake.
recent Mw 7.1 earthquake in the Tibet Autonomous Region
further underscores the region’s seismic vulnerability.
Since
earthquakes are not confined by national borders
, tremors were also felt in Nepal and northern India.
event is a reminder that tectonic forces are constantly at work
, and another major earthquake in the Himalayan region is not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when.’
The Overlooked Danger: Human Activity and Earthquake Risks
While tectonic movements are a natural phenomenon,
human activities have exacerbated seismic risks.
Large-scale infrastructure projects in the Himalayas
, such as dams, tunnels, and extensive road networks, can weaken already fragile rock formations.
Additionally, d
eforestation and unregulated urban expansion put more lives at risk by reducing natural shock absorption
and increasing the likelihood of landslides following an earthquake.
Given these realities,
it is imperative for governments and communities to recognise the Himalayan region not just as a place of beauty but also as a seismic hotspot
that demands proactive planning and strict safety measures.
Media and Government Response
media has played a crucial role in bringing attention to the risks
associated with earthquakes.
While predicting earthquakes remains beyond current scientific capabilities, governments can mitigate damage by adhering to
strict building codes
the seismic tremors felt in Delhi and Bihar on February 17 indicate that merely following existing codes
may not be sufficient.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s response
to the February 17 tremors, urging citizens to stay calm and take precautions,
was a reassuring gesture.
the real responsibility for earthquake preparedness lies with the government
, which must implement long-term structural and policy measures.
Necessary Steps for Disaster Mitigation and Preparedness
Halting Construction That Weakens Earth’s Crust:
Infrastructure projects, especially in seismically active zones (II, III, and IV), should be reassessed to minimise disruptions to geological stability.
Updating Seismic Risk Maps:
These maps should guide the protection of vulnerable buildings and the retrofitting of structures such as dams and nuclear reactors.
Implementing a Seismic Insurance Scheme:
Encouraging insurance for earthquake-prone structures can help reduce financial strain during disasters.
Planning for Rescue and Rehabilitation:
Governments should allocate resources for emergency response, temporary shelters, and rehabilitation efforts.
International Collaboration on Earthquake Prediction and Infrastructure Resilience:
Partnering with countries experienced in earthquake preparedness can help India develop better forecasting models and architectural solutions.
Conclusion
While earthquakes cannot be prevented or precisely predicted,
their impact can certainly be mitigated through comprehensive planning and preparedness.
The recent seismic activities should serve as a wake-up call for India to strengthen its infrastructure
, enforce stricter building regulations, and invest in scientific research on earthquake forecasting.
With the right measures in place,
the country can ensure that when the inevitable earthquake strikes, the damage is minimised, and lives are saved

Today’s editorial talks about the trade relations between Qatar and India. This content would help in mains answer writing GS Paper 2 in International Relations.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
India and Qatar agreed to strengthen their relationship as a “strategic partnership,” aim to double trade to $28 billion in five years, and attract $10 billion in Qatari investment into India.
What are the trade relations between India and Qatar?
Strategic Partnership and Trade Goals:
India and Qatar have elevated their bilateral relations to a strategic partnership, aiming to double their trade from approximately USD 14 billion to USD 28 billion over the next five years. This agreement was formalized during discussions between the Indian Prime Minister and Qatari Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani.
Key Exports and Imports:
In the fiscal year 2022-23, India’s exports to Qatar were valued at USD 1.96 billion, while imports from Qatar reached USD 16.8 billion. Major exports from Qatar to India include liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and petrochemicals, whereas India exports cereals, textiles, machinery, and precious stones to Qatar.
Energy Cooperation:
Qatar is India’s largest supplier of LNG and LPG, accounting for over 48% of India’s LNG imports and 29% of its LPG imports in FY 2022-23. This energy trade has been a cornerstone of the bilateral relationship, with long-term contracts in place for continued supply.
Investment Opportunities:
Qatari investments in India have surpassed USD 1.5 billion, focusing on sectors such as telecommunications, retail, and infrastructure. Indian companies are also increasingly investing in Qatar, with significant contributions from firms like Larsen & Toubro and Wipro.
Future Prospects:
Both countries are exploring avenues beyond energy, looking to enhance cooperation in technology, manufacturing, and entrepreneurship. The recent discussions included the potential for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to further facilitate trade relations.
Why is Qatar important to India?
Energy Security:
As a major LNG supplier, Qatar plays a crucial role in ensuring India’s energy security, accounting for over 48% of India’s LNG imports. Example: India imports around 8.5 million tonnes of LNG annually from Qatar, covering a significant portion of its energy demand.
Trade & Investment:
Bilateral trade is growing, with plans to double it to $28 billion and explore a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Example: Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) has invested in Indian companies like Reliance Jio and Adani Green Energy.
Indian Diaspora & Remittances:
Over 800,000 Indians work in Qatar, making them the largest expatriate group.Example: Indian workers send billions in remittances to India annually, supporting the economy and families back home.
Strategic & Security Cooperation:
The new Strategic Partnership Agreement enhances cooperation in defence, intelligence sharing, and counterterrorism. Example: India and Qatar conduct joint naval exercises to ensure maritime security in the Gulf region.
Geopolitical & Diplomatic Influence:
Qatar plays a key role in West Asian diplomacy, including mediation in conflicts like Israel-Palestine and Taliban negotiations. Example: India engages with Qatar on regional issues to maintain stability and secure energy interests.
What are the benefits of recent deals between India and Qatar related to LNG?
Duration and Volume:
The new agreement extends the supply of 7.5 million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) of LNG from Qatar to India for an additional 20 years, from 2028 to 2048. This is an extension of the existing contract that was set to expire in 2028.
Pricing Structure:
The renewed deal is expected to offer LNG at rates lower than current prices, potentially saving India around $6 billion over the life of the contract. The pricing structure will differ from previous terms, eliminating fixed charges and allowing for more flexible pricing based on market conditions.
This agreement is crucial for India’s energy security, as Qatar currently supplies about 35% of India’s LNG imports. The deal ensures a stable and reliable supply of natural gas, which is essential for various sectors, including power generation, fertilizers, and city gas distribution.
What are the challenges between India and Qatar?
Legal & Human Rights Issues

**********The deeper meaning of declining school enrolment
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges in the education sector; Demographic dividend;
Why in the News?
Recently, the Ministry of Education released the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (U-DISE+) data for the years 2022-23 and 2023-24.
Could India’s demographic dividend end before it becomes rich and ageing?
Declining School Enrolment Signals a Shrinking Youth Population:
U-DISE+ data (2022-24) shows a
15.5 million drop (6%)
in school enrolment since 2018-19, reflecting a demographic shift. This means that fewer young people will enter the workforce in the future.
Over the past decade, school enrolment in India has dropped by 24.51 million (9.45%), with elementary-level enrolment seeing the sharpest decline of 18.7 million (13.45%). While secondary enrolment fell by 1.43 million (3.75%), senior secondary enrolment increased by 3.63 million (15.46%).
Shift in Schooling Patterns
: Government and aided school enrolments have declined significantly, while private schools saw only a slight rise. The number of schools has also reduced by 79,109 (5.1%) since 2017-18, reflecting a long-term demographic transition rather than a temporary trend.
Falling Fertility Rate Below Replacement Level:
Total Fertility Rate (TFR) dropped to 2.01 in 2022
, below the
replacement level of 2.1
. A declining birth rate leads to an ageing population without sufficient workforce replenishment.
Aging Population Before Achieving High-Income Status:
Japan and China leveraged their demographic dividend before ageing, but India may
age before industrializing fully
. It leads to a higher dependency ratio and increased pension and healthcare burdens.
Labor Market and Economic Growth Concerns:
China’s workforce peaked in 2011, leading to labour shortages and slower growth. India might face a similar scenario. It led to reduced economic productivity and difficulty sustaining high GDP growth.
Decline in Number of Schools and Future Workforce Readiness:
The number of schools in India
declined by 79,109 (5.1%)
from 2017-18 to 2023-24, indicating fewer children. Fewer skilled workers, potentially impacting India’s
aspirations to become a global manufacturing and service hub
Demographic Shift
: The school-age population (6-17 years) has decreased by 17.30 million (5.78%) due to lower fertility rates (2.01 in 2022, below the replacement level of 2.10), leading to fewer children in elementary and secondary education.
What challenges are associated with enrollment?
Economic Strain Due to a Shrinking Workforce:
A declining working-age population may slow economic growth, limiting India’s ability to generate sufficient income to support an aging society.
Example:
India’s fertility rate dropped to 2.01 in 2022, below the replacement level of 2.1, indicating a future decline in the labor force.
Educational System Under Pressure:
Falling elementary-level enrollment has reduced demand for schools and teachers, potentially affecting education quality. Meanwhile, senior secondary enrollment increased by
over the past decade, putting strain on higher education infrastructure.
Elementary school enrollment fell by
in the last decade, signaling a demographic shift impacting resource allocation.
Growing Educational and Economic Inequality:
Government and aided schools, which serve marginalized communities, saw a sharp enrollment decline of
19.89 million (13.8%)
4.95 million (16.41%)
, respectively, while private schools saw a slight increase, widening the education gap.
Enrollment in private unaided schools rose by
1.61 million (2.03%)
, indicating a shift toward private education that is less accessible to low-income groups.
How might this impact society?
Shrinking Workforce & Economic Slowdown:
Fewer young people entering the job market may lead to labor shortages, reducing economic productivity.
Japan and South Korea struggle with aging populations, leading to workforce gaps and slower growth.
Increased Social Inequality:
Government school enrollment decline disproportionately affects marginalized communities, widening the education gap.
In rural India, fewer children in government schools may limit upward mobility and economic opportunities.
Strain on Higher Education & Skill Shortages:
A decline in secondary-level enrollment can result in fewer skilled workers, affecting industries reliant on educated labor.
IT and manufacturing sectors may face talent shortages, impacting India’s competitiveness in global markets.
Higher Dependency Ratio & Welfare Burden:
With an aging population and fewer workers, the burden on healthcare and pension systems will rise.
Countries like Italy and Germany face financial stress due to increased elderly care costs.
Changing Consumer & Housing Markets:
Lower youth populations may reduce demand for housing, schooling, and consumer goods, shifting economic dynamics.
Fewer school-age children may lead to school closures, teacher unemployment, and real estate downturns in urban centers.
What are the steps taken by the Indian Government?
National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:
Aims to transform the education system by ensuring universal access, equity, and quality learning from early childhood to higher education.
Targets a
100% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in school education by 2030
and emphasizes vocational training to meet future workforce demands.
Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan:
A centrally sponsored initiative that integrates existing education programs to provide inclusive and equitable education from pre-school to senior secondary levels.
Focuses on
reducing gender and social disparities
, enhancing infrastructure, and promoting digital learning.
Skill India Mission:
Aim to train
over 400 million people
in industry-relevant skills to support economic growth.
Includes
Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)
for skill training and certification to boost employability.
Way forward:
Enhancing Educational Access & Quality: Need to
strengthen government school infrastructure, improve teacher training, and expand digital learning to bridge educational disparities and ensure skill readiness.
Strategic Workforce & Economic Planning:
Align skill development programs with future industry needs, promote labor-intensive sectors, and implement policies to balance workforce participation and aging demographics.
Mains PYQ:
National Education Policy 2020 isin conformity with the Sustainable Development Goal-4 (2030). It intends to restructure and reorient education system in India. Critically examine the statement.

**********SC to hear petitions against law on CEC appointment today
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Chief election commission;
Why in the News?
Recently, the Supreme Court agreed to give priority to a hearing on February 19 regarding petitions challenging a new law that gives the central government more control over appointing the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners (ECs).
What are the issues related to CEC?
Challenge to the 2023 Law:
The Supreme Court is hearing petitions challenging the validity of the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners Act, 2023. This law is under scrutiny because it
excludes the Chief Justice of India (CJI)
from the selection panel for Election Commissioners.
Petitioners argue that the government excluded the CJI from the selection process, making it a “mockery of democracy”. They allege that the appointments of the CEC and EC under the 2023 law disregard a Constitution Bench ruling that mandated the inclusion of the CJI in the selection panel.
Opposition Dissent:
Congress submitted a dissent note, stating that the process of choosing the Election Commissioner and CEC should be free from executive interference and that removing the CJI exacerbates concerns about the integrity of the electoral process.
Concerns About Neutrality:
The current selection committee composition, consisting of the Prime Minister, a Union Cabinet Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition, is viewed by some as being biased towards the ruling party, which could impinge on the Election Commission’s neutrality.
What is the process for the appointment of CEC?
Article 324 of the Constitution
– Empowers the Election Commission of India (ECI) to supervise, direct, and control elections to Parliament, state legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President.
Tenure & Conditions (Article 324(5))
– The CEC enjoys a fixed tenure and can only be removed in the manner prescribed for a Supreme Court judge (i.e., through impeachment). However, Election Commissioners can be removed based on the CEC’s recommendation.
Supreme Court Judgments
S.S. Dhanoa v. Union of India (1991)
– Reaffirmed the security of tenure for Election Commissioners.
T.N. Seshan v. Union of India (1995)
– Strengthened the autonomy of the Election Commission.
Anoop Baranwal Case (2023)
– Laid down a structured appointment process to ensure neutrality, later altered by the 2023 Act.
Prior to 2023 Law:
The Supreme Court had directed that the CECs and Election Commissioners be appointed by the President based on the advice of a Selection Committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha/leader of the single largest party in Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India.
The Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service, and Term of Office) Act, 2023
– Codified the appointment process but replaced the CJI with a Cabinet Minister in the selection process. According to this act, Election Commissioners are selected by a committee consisting of the
Prime Minister, a Union Cabinet Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition or the leader of the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha.
Recent Appointment:
Gyanesh Kumar was recently appointed as the new CEC, and Dr. Vivek Joshi as an Election Commissioner.
What are the legal and constitutional basis of CEC?
Section 7(1) of the Act:
The petitions specifically challenge the validity of Section 7(1) of the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners Act. This section outlines the selection committee for appointing the CEC and Election Commissioners, which includes the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and a Union Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister.
The petitions before the Supreme Court question whether Parliament has the authority to nullify or amend a Constitution Bench judgment through legislation
Article 141 of the Constitution:
The Supreme Court will consider whether the 2023 Act circumvents or dilutes the apex court’s authority to pronounce binding decisions under Article 141 of the Constitution.
Dilution of Supreme Court Judgment:
Petitioners argue that the 2023 law dilutes the Supreme Court’s judgment in the Anoop Baranwal case, which aimed to ensure an independent Election Commission free from executive influence.
Way forward:
Restore Judicial Oversight
: Reinstate the Chief Justice of India in the selection panel to uphold judicial independence and maintain the neutrality of the Election Commission.
Legislative Safeguards
: Enact a comprehensive law ensuring a transparent and bipartisan appointment process, reducing executive dominance and reinforcing democratic principles.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the role of the Election Commission of India in the light of the evolution of the Model Code of Conduct.

Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
It has been 10 years since the Soil Health Card Scheme was introduced by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 19th February 2015 at Suratgarh, Rajasthan.
What is the Soil Health Card Scheme?
The
SHC Scheme
was launched to
analyze soil quality and provide personalized recommendations to farmers
for
nutrient management and soil fertility improvement
The scheme is implemented by the
Department of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare
It has been integrated into
Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)
2022-23
under the
Soil Health & Fertility component
Key Features of the Soil Health Card Scheme:
SHC evaluates
12 parameters
, including:
Macronutrients:
N, P, K, S.
Micronutrients:
Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, B.
Physical & Chemical Properties:
pH, EC, OC.
Samples collected
twice a year
(post-Rabi and Kharif).
Grid-based sampling
2.5 ha in irrigated areas, 10 ha in rain-fed areas
SHC Portal & Mobile App
enable online tracking, GPS-tagged samples, and QR-coded test results.
Village-Level Soil Testing Labs (VLSTLs)
665 VLSTLs established
across
17 states
local soil testing
School Soil Health Programme
: Implemented in
1020 schools
, with 1000 soil testing labs and 125,972 students enrolled.
Successes and Limitations of SHC:
Success:
Crop Yields & Productivity Increased
(8-10%) through optimized fertilizer application.
Farmers saved up to ₹5,000 per hectare
by using balanced fertilizers.
665 Village-Level Soil Testing Labs (VLSTLs)
established, improving soil testing accessibility.
Technological integration (SHC Portal & Mobile App)
ensures real-time monitoring.
Encouraged sustainable farming practices
, reducing soil degradation and nutrient depletion.
Limitations and Challenges:
Many
farmers are unaware of SHC benefits
and continue
traditional farming methods
Reports often reach farmers too late
for implementation.
Limited soil testing labs
and trained staff in remote areas.
Farmers need
training to interpret
SHC reports and apply recommendations.

**********Delhi Earthquake
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Delhi Earthquake and its causes
Why in the News?
A
magnitude 4 earthquake
struck
New Delhi
with epicentre near
Dhaula Kuan
. The quake was
shallow (5 km depth)
, highlighting Delhi’s
seismic vulnerability
due to its location in
Zone IV
of India’s
earthquake hazard map
Possible Causes of the Earthquake
Tectonic Activity along the Delhi-Hardwar Ridge:
Delhi sits on the
, an
active seismic fault
Continuous
collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates
builds tectonic stress, leading to
earthquakes when stress is released
Groundwater Extraction as a Seismic Trigger:
Excessive exploitation alters
rock pressure
, potentially inducing fault movements.
Anthropogenic (Human-Induced) Activity:
Urbanization, metro construction, and large-scale infrastructure projects
alter subsurface stress.
Vibrations from construction activities can contribute to
localized seismic instability
About the Aravalli-Delhi Fold Belt
is a
major geological formation
that extends from
southern Rajasthan to Haryana and Delhi
It consists of
ancient folded rock formations
that have undergone
millions of years of geological transformation
This region has
several pre-existing faults
, meaning seismic activity can occur
without direct tectonic subduction
Although
historically more active
, tectonic movements in the belt have slowed over time.
These earthquakes occur due to
fault reactivation and local stress accumulation
rather than large-scale tectonic shifts.
Himalayan earthquakes
are caused by
, where the
Indian plate moves under the Eurasian plate
