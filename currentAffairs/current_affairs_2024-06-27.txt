DEPUTY SPEAKER
Syllabus
Prelims – POLITY
Context:
With the Opposition’s increased strength in Lok Sabha, its members are hoping to get the post of Deputy Speaker. There was no Deputy Speaker for the entire duration of the 17th Lok Sabha (2019-24).
Background:-
The first four Deputy Speakers, from 1952 to 1969, were from the ruling Congress. The Opposition had the post of Deputy Speaker continuously from 1990 through 2014.
Key takeaways
According to Article 95(1), the Deputy Speaker performs the duties of the Speaker if the post is vacant.
The Deputy Speaker has the same general powers as the Speaker when presiding over the House.
All references to the “Speaker” in the Rules are deemed to be references to the Deputy Speaker as well for the times when he or she presides.
Both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker must be appointed “as soon as may be”. Article 93 states that “The House of the People shall, as soon as may be, choose two members of the House to be respectively Speaker and Deputy Speaker”.
Article 178 contains the corresponding provision for the Speakers and Deputy Speakers in the state Assemblies.
Is it mandatory under the Constitution to have a Deputy Speaker?
The Constitution does not specify a time frame for making the appointments. It is this gap in the provision that allows governments to delay or avoid appointing a Deputy Speaker.
However, constitutional experts have pointed out that both Article 93 and Article 178 use the words “shall” and “as soon as may be” – indicating that not only is the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker mandatory, it must be held at the earliest.
What are the rules for the election of the Deputy Speaker?
The Speaker / Dy Speaker is elected from among the Lok Sabha members by a simple majority of members present and voting
The election of the Deputy Speaker usually takes place in the second session, even though there is no bar on having this election in the first session of the new Lok Sabha or Assembly. But the election of Deputy Speaker is generally not delayed beyond the second session unless there are some genuine and unavoidable constraints.
In the Lok Sabha, the election of Deputy Speaker is governed by Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.According to Rule 8, the election shall be held on such date as the Speaker may fix.
The Deputy Speaker is elected once a motion proposing his or her name is carried. Once elected, the Deputy Speaker usually continues in office until the dissolution of the House.
Under Article 94 (and Article 179 for state Assemblies), the Speaker or Deputy Speaker shall vacate his office if he ceases to be a member of the House of the People. They may also resign (to each other), or may be removed from office by a resolution of the House of the People passed by a majority of all the then members of the House.
Additional Information:
After the first Speaker, G V Mavalankar, died in 1956 before his term ended, Deputy Speaker M Ananthasayanam Ayyangar filled in for the remaining tenure of Lok Sabha from 1956 to 1957. Ayyangar was later elected as Speaker of the second Lok Sabha.

CHINA’S SAMPLE RETURN LUNAR MISSION
Prelims & Mains – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
China’s Chang’e-6 on Tuesday became the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the Moon — the part that the Earth never gets to see.
India’s Chandrayaan-4 mission, which is currently under development by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), will also be a sample return mission.Chandrayaan-3 landed about 600 km from the South Pole of the Moon last year.
Key Takeaways
The lander descended on the Moon’s surface on June 1, and spent two days collecting rocks and soil from one of the oldest and largest of lunar craters — the 2,500 km-wide South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin — using a robotic arm and drill.
The lander then launched an ascent module that transferred the samples to the Chang’e-6 orbiter that was orbiting the Moon. On June 21, the orbiter released a service module thatbrought back the samples to Earth.
Is this the first time a spacecraft has brought lunar samples to Earth?
Back in July 1969, the US Apollo 11 mission brought 22 kg of lunar surface material, including 50 rocks, to Earth.
In September 1970, the Soviet Luna 16 mission — the first robotic sample return mission — too, brought pieces of the Moon to Earth.
In recent years, Chang’e-5, the predecessor of Chang’e-6, brought back 2 kg of lunar soil in December 2020.
All these samples, however, came from the near side of the Moon.
Difficult terrain, giant craters, and the difficulty in communicating with ground control made it technically challenging to land a spacecraft on the side that never faces the Earth. The Moon is tidally locked with Earth; thus we see only one side of our nearest space neighbour.
Chang’e-4 overcame these difficulties in 2019, putting the Yutu-2 rover on the far lunar surface. Now, Chang’e-6 has not only landed on the far side, but also returned with samples from there.
Why are sample return missions significant in the first place?
A sample return missionsuch as Chang’e-6 aims to collect and return samples from an extraterrestrial location like the Moon or Mars to Earth for analysis. The sample can be rocks or soil — or even some molecules.
In situ robotic explorations — in which landers, orbiters, and rovers carry out experiments in space or on heavenly bodies — can carry only miniature instruments that are not very sophisticated or accurate, and answer only certain types of questions. For instance, they can’t determine the origin or age of a rock.
If the samples can be brought to Earth, on the other hand, scientists can examine them using extremely sensitive laboratory instruments. Also, returned samples can be preserved for decades, and can be examined by future generations using ever more advanced technology.

EUROPEAN UNION’S NEW NATURE RESTORATION PLAN
Prelims & Mains – ENVIRONMENT
The European Union (EU) on June 17 approved its ambitious Nature Restoration Plan which aims to make continent-wide efforts to restore degraded ecosystems.
It is a crucial part of the bloc’s 2030 biodiversity strategy which, in turn, forms a core area of the European Green Deal. The European Green Deal is a package of policy initiatives, which aims to set the EU on the path to a green transition, with the ultimate goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.
The new law aims to restore ecosystems, including species and habitats that exist on EU’s land and in seas to:
enable the long-term and sustained recovery of biodiverse and resilient nature,
contribute to achieving the EU’s climate mitigation and climate adaptation objectives, and
meet international commitments.
According to the European Commission, 81% of habitats in the EU currently have a “poor” status, and one in three bee and butterfly species are in decline.
What are the targets to be met under the new law?
The primary target of the new legislation is long-term recovery of ecosystems.
The measures should ideally cover at least 20% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050.
Priority should be given to areas under the Natura 2000 – a network of 27,000 natural sites protected by EU legislation.
The Restoration Law also has specific targets based on existing legislations, for urban, forest, marine, and agricultural ecosystems, for pollinating insects, and those related to river connectivity. Some of these are:
Reversing the decline of pollinator population by 2030
No net loss of green urban space and tree cover by 2030, and an increase in their area thereafter
Increasing stock of organic carbon
Restoring drained peatlands under agricultural use
Restoring the habitats of iconic marine species such as dolphins and porpoises, sharks and seabirds
Restoring at least 25,000 km of rivers to a free-flowing state by 2030
How will the law be implemented?
Countries in the EU bloc are expected to submit National Restoration Plans to the Commission within two years – by mid-2026 – specifying their plans to achieve the targets.
Monitoring and reporting progress on these targets will be under the purview of the countries themselves.
The European Environment Agency will prepare technical reports on this progress.

COTTON CULTIVATION IN INDIA
Prelims & Mains – GEOGRAPHY
According to the Ministry of Textiles, cotton consumption by the textile industry during the current marketing season (October 2023 to September 2024) is one of the highest this decade.
This year is expected to be the second highest in terms of consumption over the last ten years, with an estimated demand of 307 lakh bales, including 103 lakh bales from the MSME textile units.
Key Takeaways:
India is believed to be the original home of the cotton plant.
Although a significant portion of cotton-growing areas was lost to Pakistan during partition, India’s acreage has increased considerably over the last 50 years.
Cotton occupies about 4.7% of the total cropped area in the country.
Cotton is a tropical or sub-tropical crop primarily grown in semi-arid regions, especially on the Deccan Plateau.
Cotton is a Kharif crop, taking 6 to 8 months to mature.
It requires at least 210 frost-free days and prefers light rainfall (50 to 100 centimeters).
Bright sunshine during growth and a clear sky during flowering are essential.
Ideal soil for cotton cultivation is well-drained and capable of retaining moisture. Black cotton soil is preferred.
Cotton-Producing States:
India has three major cotton-growing regions:
North-West: Includes parts of Punjab, Haryana, and northern Rajasthan.
West: Gujarat and Maharashtra.
South: Plateaus of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.
Leading cotton producers are Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Telangana.
Other significant states include Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.

INFLATION
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das has recently emphasized the importance of managing inflation effectively.
The central bank has been mandated by the government to keep inflation at 4% with a margin of 2% on either side.
About Inflation
Inflation refers to the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.
It erodes the purchasing power of money and affects the standard of living.
Causes of Inflation:
Demand-Pull Inflation: Occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, leading to rising prices.
Cost-Push Inflation: Arises due to increased production costs (e.g., higher wages, raw material costs).
Built-In Inflation: A self-perpetuating cycle where expectations of future inflation lead to higher wages and prices.
Effects of Inflation:
Positive Effects:
Debt relief for borrowers (as money becomes less valuable).
Encourages spending and investment.
Negative Effects:
Reduced purchasing power for fixed-income earners.
Uncertainty and instability in the economy.
Measuring Inflation:
Consumer Price Index (CPI):
The CPI measures changes in the cost of a basket of goods and services consumed by households.
CPI includes various categories such as food, energy, commodities (like cars and clothes), and services (e.g., rent, healthcare).
Each category has a relative importance based on its share of total expenditures.
Wholesale Price Index (WPI):
The WPI reflects changes in wholesale prices of goods at the producer level.
WPI helps understand cost pressures in production and supply chains.
Unlike CPI, WPI does not directly represent consumer prices.
Controlling Inflation:
Monetary Policy:
Interest Rates: The RBI adjusts policy interest rates (like the repo rate) to influence borrowing costs. Higher rates can reduce demand and curb inflation.
Open Market Operations (OMOs): The RBI buys or sells government securities to manage liquidity and influence interest rates.
Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): The CRR determines the portion of deposits banks must keep with the RBI. Adjusting it affects liquidity and lending capacity.
Fiscal Policy: The government can control inflation through fiscal measures such as
Taxation: Adjusting taxes affects disposable income and spending.
Government Spending: Managing public expenditure impacts demand.
Supply-Side Measures:
Agricultural Reforms: Enhancing productivity and reducing supply bottlenecks in agriculture can stabilize food prices.
Infrastructure Development: Improving infrastructure reduces production costs.
Trade Policies: Facilitating imports can ease supply constraints.
Inflation Targeting Framework:
The Central Government, in consultation with the RBI, determines the inflation target in terms of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), once in five years and notifies it in the Official Gazette.
The MPC determines the policy repo rate required to achieve the inflation target.

EXTERNAL DEBT TO GDP RATIO
: The external debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.7% at the end of March 2024 from 19.0% at the end of March 2023.
India’s external debt reached $663.8 billion by the end of March 2024, marking a 6% increase (approximately $39.7 billion) compared to March 2023.
About Innovation for Defence Excellence (iDEX)
The external debt-to-GDP ratio is a crucial economic metric that compares a country’s external debt to its gross domestic product (GDP).
External Debt:
External debt refers to the total amount of money a country owes to external creditors, including foreign governments, international organizations, and private entities outside the country.
It includes both short-term and long-term debt obligations.
External debt is a type of public debt. Public debt refers to the total amount of money that a government owes to external creditors and domestic lenders.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP):
GDP represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders during a specific period (usually a year).
It reflects the economic output and productivity of a nation.
Calculation of External Debt-to-GDP Ratio:
The external debt-to-GDP ratio is calculated by dividing the total external debt by the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).
This ratio helps assess a nation’s financial stability and its ability to manage debt obligations.
A low external debt-to-GDP ratio indicates that an economy produces sufficient goods and services to repay its debts without accumulating further debt.
Conversely, a high ratio suggests challenges in paying off external debts, potentially leading to higher interest rates for borrowing.
Significance:
When a country’s debt-to-GDP ratio climbs, its risk of default increases, potentially causing financial panic in domestic and international markets.
Governments aim to lower this ratio, but during periods of unrest (e.g., wartime or recession), borrowing may increase to stimulate growth.

**********Role of a Lok Sabha’s Leader of Opposition
Why in News?
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the 18th Lok Sabha, a position that lay vacant for 10 years because no party had numbers equalling a tenth of the strength of the House.
The LoP is the parliamentary chairperson
of the largest political party/ coalition in the Lok Sabha that is not in government.
What’s in Today’s Article?
The Position of Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
Powers of the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the House
The Position of Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha:
Statutory recognition:
It was officially described in
the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act 1977
The Act describes the Leader of Opposition as:
A member of the Council of States or the House of the People (as the case may be),
Who is the Leader in that House of the party (having the greatest numerical strength and recognised as such by the Chairman/ the Speaker) in opposition to the Government.
Numerical strength:
According to a conventional understanding, in order to get the post of Leader of Opposition
a party must have at least 10% of MPs
in the House.
Debate over numerical strength:
According to the former Lok Sabha Secretary General PDT Achary, the law is clear that the Speaker is required to recognise the leader of the
numerically largest party
in opposition as the leader of opposition.
There is no such rule
, which requires a party to have at least 10% of the members of the House for recognising someone as the Leader of the Opposition.
Before the BJP in 2014 and 2019, the Congress (having 415 members in Lok Sabha) in 1984 denied TDP (with 30 MPs) the post of Leader of Opposition, on the basis of the above mysterious rule.
Salary and sumptuary allowances:
S/he shall be entitled to receive a salary and allowances as are specified in the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act 1954.
Powers of the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the House:
Order of precedence:
The LoP in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha come at No. 7, along with
Union Cabinet Ministers,
The National Security Advisor,
The Principal Secretary to the PM,
The Vice-Chairperson of the NITI Aayog,
Former PMs, and Chief Ministers.
Sitting position in the House:
The LoP sits in the front row
to the left of the Chair, and enjoys
certain privileges on ceremonial occasions
like escorting the Speaker-elect to the rostrum (Chair of the Speaker).
The LoP is also entitled to a seat in the front row during the Address by the President to both Houses of Parliament.
The main duty of the LoP:
It is to
serve as the voice of the opposition
in the House and is considered as
a shadow Prime Minister with a shadow Cabinet.
This means, s/he is
ready to take over the administration
if the Government resigns or is defeated on the floor of the House.
Because the parliamentary system is based on "
mutual forbearance
" (acknowledging that we do not all have to agree on everything), the LoP is free to disagree while yet allowing the PM to rule.
His/her proactive role
in facilitating smooth functioning of the business of the House is as important as that of the Government.
Practical role and responsibility:
Most importantly, the LoP is the
opposition’s representative in the high-powered committees
headed by the PM for appointment to key posts such as
The Director of CBI,
The Central Vigilance Commissioner and Chief Information Commissioner,
The Chairperson and Members of the National Human Rights Commission, and
The Lokpal.
S/he will also be a
member of crucial committees
, including Public Accounts, Public Undertakings, Estimates and several Joint Parliamentary Committees.

**********Impact of Coal Mining Pollutants on Workers
Why in the News?
Prolonged exposure to coal mining pollutants has resulted in widespread respiratory and skin diseases among the workers and people in six districts in India, where coal extraction is a major occupation.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About the Study (Objective, Impact on Communities, Health Impact, Shift from Coal)
India’s Dependency on Coal
About the Study:
A survey was conducted by the
National Foundation for India
which is an organisation that works on social justice issues.
It conducted a survey, involving 1,200 households, to study the prolonged exposure to coal mining pollutants on the mining workers.
The six districts covered for the survey were Koriya and Raigarh (
Chhattisgarh
), Dhanbad and Ramgarh (
Jharkhand
), Angul and Jajpur (
Odisha
).
The surveys, on average, spanned 18-20 villages per district.
Key Findings of the Study:
Impact on Marginalised Communities:
It was found that 81.5 per cent among those surveyed belonged to the marginalised SC, ST, and OBC communities and the rest were from the general category.
The survey found lower levels of income and educational attainment among SC and ST groups compared to OBC groups, and their higher representation in low-paying, irregular jobs in coal-dumping yards, coal sidings, coal loading, coal transport, coal washeries and other informal work.
This disparity, the report said, indicated the
challenges that marginalised groups will face as India gradually phases down coal use
, resulting in significant job losses and economic downturns in coal-dependent regions.
Impact on Health:
People living closer to the mines were relatively more vulnerable.
Dhanbad and Ramgarh, which had more people living in such zones, had higher incidence of lung and breathing-related diseases as well as skin infections.
At least 65% of participants interviewed reported issues such as chronic bronchitis, asthma, and skin ailments such as eczema, dermatitis and fungal infections.
On average, a household in these districts spent ₹300 to ₹1,000 on monthly medical-related bills.
The average annual hospitalization expenses in Dhanbad (₹28,461 per household) were the highest.
Shift from Coal:
The main goal of the study was to explore the concept of a 'just transition' – finding effective and sensitive ways to help individuals who depend on coal mining to move away from these jobs.
As the world moves away from coal, significant job losses and economic declines are anticipated in coal-dependent regions.
This shift will affect not only coal miners and workers directly but also the wider local economy.
India’s Dependence on Coal for Energy Supply:
While renewable energy capacity is dramatically increasing,
coal still provides around 70 per cent of the country’s electricity
Coal is expected to
account for at least 21 per cent of India’s electricity requirements even by 2050
Easily Available Source of Power
Coal can help the country meet its energy needs without depending on imports as it is abundantly available domestically.
Alternatives like nuclear energy have been hampered by high costs and safety concerns.
India’s Developmental Needs
To lift millions of people out of poverty, India needs energy.
International Energy Agency
(IEA) predicts that between 2020 and 2040, India will have the largest growth in energy demand of any country in the world.
To meet this demand, India will need to rely on a variety of energy sources—both conventional and renewable.
Source of Employment
Beyond providing desperately needed energy,
coal is also a vital source of jobs and economic growth and a driver of industrialization
, just as it was in developed countries.
Around
4 million people in India are employed either directly or indirectly in the coal sector
Other than active workers, another 500,000 Indians rely on the coal sector for their pensions.
Source of Revenue for the Government
Coal India Limited is the largest coal mining company in the world.
The coal sector is a major source of revenue for States and the Central Government.

**********Evaluating India's Progress in Harnessing Rooftop Solar Energy
Why in news?
Rooftop solar (RTS) holds significant promise for transforming India's energy sector by providing a sustainable, decentralized, and cost-effective way to address the nation's increasing electricity demand and promoting self-reliance among consumers.
In the fiscal year 2023-2024, India's installed
RTS capacity surged by 2.99 GW
marking the highest annual growth to date
. By March 31, 2024, the total installed
RTS capacity reached 11.87 GW
, according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
To adequately meet the escalating energy needs, India must intensify its efforts to expand its RTS infrastructure.
What’s in today’s article?
Rooftop solar (RTS) programme
Performance of States
Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana
Way forward
Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission: A Major Solar Initiative
Launched in January 2010, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission marked India's first significant effort to boost solar energy production.
Initially targeting 20 GW of solar energy (including RTS) in three phases (2010-2013, 2013-2017, 2017-2022), the goal was revised in 2015 to 100 GW by 2022, with a
40 GW RTS component
Revised Targets and Achievements
By December 2022, India achieved an installed RTS capacity of approximately 7.5 GW. Consequently, the 40 GW target deadline was extended to 2026.
Drivers of Growth in RTS Installations
Over the years, improvements to the RTS installation numbers have been driven by favourable initiatives.
These include:
the Sustainable Partnership for RTS Acceleration in Bharat, SUPRABHA, and
the Sustainable Rooftop Implementation for Solar Transfiguration of India, SRISTI, schemes,
financial incentives, technological advances, awareness campaigns, and training programmes.
Untapped Potential and Future Goals
Despite progress, India's overall RTS potential remains vast at approximately 796 GW.
Many States have yet to fully harness this potential.
To meet the ambitious targets of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity (including 280 GW of solar) by 2030, and net-zero goals by 2070, RTS needs to contribute about 100 GW by 2030.
Leading States in Rooftop Solar (RTS) Installations
Gujarat: A Model of Success
Installed Capacity: 3,456 MW
Key Factors: Proactive government policies, efficient approval processes, numerous RTS installers, high consumer awareness
Notable Achievement: Modhera, India’s first solar-powered village with 1,300 RTS systems of 1 kW each
Maharashtra: Strong Performance
Installed Capacity: 2,072 MW
Key Factors: Robust solar policies, favorable regulatory environment
Rajasthan: High Potential
Installed Capacity: 1,154 MW
Key Factors: Largest state by land area, high solar irradiance, streamlined approvals, financial incentives, public-private partnerships
Other Notable Performers
Kerala: 675 MW
Tamil Nadu: 599 MW
Karnataka: 594 MW
States Lagging Behind
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand
Challenges: Bureaucratic hurdles, inadequate infrastructure, lack of public awareness
Conclusion
While states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan are making significant progress in RTS installations, others still face substantial challenges that need to be addressed to fully tap into their solar potential.
Objective
: Equip 1 crore households with rooftop solar (RTS) systems, providing up to 300 units of free electricity per month
Capacity Addition
: 20 GW from 2 kW systems per household
The scheme aims to revolutionize India's energy landscape by significantly boosting RTS capacity, ensuring energy equity, and fostering sustainable development.
It also aims to train professionals for installing, operating, and maintaining RTS systems, fostering a skilled workforce.
: Rural and urban households, especially in regions with limited electricity access, high solar potential, and vulnerable communities.
It aims to ensure equitable distribution of benefits.
Financial Outlay
Total Budget
: Rs 75,021 crore
Central Financial Assistance: Rs 65,700 crore
Incentives for Distribution Companies: Rs 4,950 crore
Other Allocations: Incentives for local bodies, model solar villages, innovative projects, payment security mechanisms, capacity building, awareness, and outreach
Technology and Infrastructure
Focus: Advanced solar technologies, energy storage solutions, smart grid infrastructure
Goal: Enhance efficiency, reliability, and resilience of RTS installations
Streamlined Processes
Intention: Simplify approvals, permits, and regulatory clearances for RTS installations
Outcome: Reduce administrative hurdles and promote ease of business
Awareness
To encourage widespread adoption of RTS technologies, comprehensive awareness campaigns led by distribution companies and local bodies are essential.
These campaigns should include grassroots initiatives and door-to-door promotions targeting every administrative level—from wards to districts.
Ensure economic viability
Economic viability is crucial for RTS adoption. Government subsidies help reduce costs, and expanding low-cost financing options from banks and non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) will further facilitate affordability.
Making RTS loans as accessible as typical vehicle loans will encourage more households to consider solar energy solutions.
Research and Development (R&D) in Solar Technology
Emphasizing R&D in solar technology, energy storage solutions, and smart-grid infrastructure can reduce costs, enhance performance, and improve reliability of RTS systems.
Innovative technologies like drone and satellite imagery for shadow analysis, rooftop suitability assessments, and energy consumption patterns can optimize RTS system designs and support achieving adoption targets.
Investment in Training and Skill Development
Initiatives like the 'Suryamitra' training programme, which has trained over 51,000 solar PV technicians since 2015, illustrate the importance of investing in training, vocational courses, and skill development.
Accelerating such programmes will help build a skilled workforce necessary for the RTS sector's growth and sustainability.
Update and review RTS policies
To support the effective implementation of the ‘Muft Bijli Yojana’ and enhance RTS adoption, there is a need to update and review RTS policies.
This includes revising net-metering regulations, grid-integration standards, and building codes to address current challenges.

**********Sri Lanka seals debt deal with Official Creditor Committee
Why in news?
Sri Lanka reached a final restructuring agreement for $5.8 billion with its bilateral lenders’ Official
Creditor Committee headed by India, Japan, and France
What’s in today’s article?
Official Creditor Committee (OCC) in Paris
Sri Lanka seals debt deal with OCC
Significance of this agreement
Role of India
Background
OCC is a group formed to represent the collective interests of creditors during the debt restructuring or bankruptcy process of a debtor, typically a corporation or sovereign entity.
The OCC is often appointed in formal insolvency proceedings, such as those under the jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts, to ensure that the creditors' interests are protected and that the restructuring plan is fair and equitable.
This term OCC is used more generally to describe any ad-hoc committee formed to represent official creditors during debt restructuring negotiations.
It does not refer to a single, permanent organization but rather to various committees that might be formed for specific cases.
About
The OCC that has signed a deal with Sri Lanka recently refers to a specific ad-hoc group of official bilateral creditors, often formed to address the debt restructuring needs of a particular country.
It was formed in May 2023
with the aim of simplifying Sri Lanka’s debt negotiations after the country defaulted on its external debt, in the wake of an unprecedented financial crash in 2022.
Members
The OCC is a platform comprising 17 countries including India and members of the Paris Club such as Japan, that have extended loans to Sri Lanka.
Headquarters
While not a permanent entity with a fixed headquarters, meetings for this OCC would typically be held in Paris, especially if coordinated with the Paris Club, which has its secretariat there.
Role and Function
The OCC's primary role is to negotiate and coordinate the restructuring of Sri Lanka’s external debt, ensuring a fair and sustainable resolution for the country's debt crisis.
- It is an informal group of official creditors (primarily major industrialized countries) that coordinates solutions for debtor countries facing payment difficulties.
- Paris, France.
- The Paris Club consists of 22 permanent member countries, which are primarily from Europe, North America, and Asia.
Recent Deal with Sri Lanka
Background - Financial crisis in Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka in mid-April of 2022 declared its first ever sovereign default since gaining independence from Britain in 1948.
The International Monetary Fund had made external debt restructuring conditional to the USD 2.9 billion bailout.
Final restructuring agreement
Sri Lanka reached a final restructuring agreement for $5.8 billion of debt with its bilateral lenders’ Official Creditor Committee in Paris.
This agreement grants significant debt relief, allowing Sri Lanka to allocate funds to essential public services & secure concessional financing for development needs.
Sri Lanka’s bilateral unpaid debt
Sri Lanka’s total bilateral unpaid debt amounts to 10, 588 million dollars.
China pact
China, Sri Lanka’s largest bilateral lender, opted to stay out of the platform, but attended the discussions as an observer.
Colombo has been negotiating its debt treatment with Beijing bilaterally and has clinched a deal.
Significance of this agreement for Sri Lanka
This agreement means that half of the government’s external debt by creditor countries and organisations has been restructured.
Debt restructuring is a process used by companies, sovereign nations, or individuals facing financial distress to
reorganize their outstanding debt obligations to make them more manageable and sustainable
This can involve a range of strategies aimed at reducing the burden of debt and improving the debtor's ability to meet future obligations.
This milestone demonstrates the strong progress made by Sri Lanka in stabilizing its economy and moving towards reform and growth.
As one of the Co-Chairs of the OCC, along with France and Japan, India has been steadfast in its commitment to the stabilization, recovery and growth of the Sri Lankan economy.
This was also demonstrated by India’s
unprecedented financial support of USD 4 billion
India was also the first creditor nation to convey financing assurances to IMF which paved the way for Sri Lanka to secure the IMF programme
