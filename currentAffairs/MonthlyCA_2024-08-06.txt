Source: TH
Why in News?
Recently a study published in the journal Science has revealed that
microdroplets of water
possess the ability to break down
minerals into
nanoparticles
.
What are the Key Highlights of the Study?
Experimental Findings:
The study demonstrated that microdroplets
could break down minerals
such as
silica (SiO
2
) and alumina (Al
3
) into nanoparticles.
This was achieved
by applying a high voltage to mineral microparticles
suspended in water, causing them to break into nanoparticles within 10 milliseconds.
The breakup of mineral microparticles into nanoparticles may be due to the
protons squeezing into crystal layers
, the electric fields produced by charged surfaces, and the surface tension of the microdroplets.
Potential Applications:
This process of nanoparticle formation has
significant implications for agriculture,
such as converting unproductive soil into productive land by supplying silica nanoparticles.
Plants absorb silica in the form of nanoparticles to help them become taller.
It also has
relevance to the origins of life
, as microdroplets might mimic proto-cells, potentially playing a role in early biochemical reactions.
Future investigation may look into whether water microdroplets naturally react with minerals in atmospheric processes, potentially forming nanoparticles through 'microdroplet showers'.

Satellite-Based Communication
Source: LM
Why in News?
Recently,
satellite-based communication
for internet connectivity has gained traction, although its evolution has shifted away from being user-centric, raising questions about its
viability
for users in India.
What is Satellite Based Communication?
About:
A communications satellite is a
type of
artificial satellite
placed in Earth’s orbit to send and receive communication data
between a source and a destination.
With over three thousand communication satellites in multiple orbits today, millions worldwide rely on satellite communications to deliver radio, television, and military applications.
Satellite communications have
opened access to voice and data communication services across the globe
in places where terrestrial cellular and
broadband connectivity
is not available or network coverage is patchy.
Types:
Based on the orbit, communication satellites fall into
one of four categories:
Geostationary Earth orbit (GEO)
Medium Earth orbit (MEO)
Low Earth orbit (LEO)
Highly elliptical orbit (HEO)
<img caption="false" class="content-img" src="http://drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1720186634_image3.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="550"/>
Working:
Satellite communications use orbiting satellites and ground stations to transmit and relay information via
microwaves
between points on Earth.
There are
three stages in the process:
Uplink
Transponder
Downlink
For example, in live television, a broadcaster sends a signal to a satellite (uplink), which then boosts and changes the frequency of the signal (transponder), before sending it back to Earth stations (downlink).
<img caption="false" class="content-img" src="http://drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1720186669_image6.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="500"/>

Current Status of Satcom Services in India:
Even though technology is ready for India, Satcom
services are not yet operational in India
primarily due to pending allocation of satellite bandwidth by the government.
Recently, Reliance Industries' Jio Platforms has
received approval from India's space regulator,
IN-SPACe
, to deploy satellites for gigabit fibre internet services, pending additional clearances from the telecom department to commence operations.
Target Audience and Services:
Satcom operators plan to target both individual consumers and enterprises.
Starlink is known for its consumer-focused approach
with portable routers, while
Airtel and Reliance Jio are looking at both consumer and enterprise markets.
<img caption="false" class="content-img" src="http://drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1720186731_image7.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="700"/>
Technological Readiness
Device compatibility is an issue
as specialised antennas are required to receive satellite signals. This adds to the cost for consumers.
Moreover,
mainstream integration
of satellite receivers in consumer devices has been
limited
so far, despite efforts by companies like Apple and Qualcomm.
Challenges and Limitations
Satcom services face challenges such as
high setup costs
, especially for consumer applications.
cost of equipment, including specialised antennas
, remains a barrier. Pricing is another concern as satcom services are perceived as expensive compared to terrestrial broadband.
Future Outlook
The future of satcom in India
hinges on regulatory approvals
, technological advancements, and addressing cost concerns. The entry of new players like Project Kuiper could potentially intensify competition and innovation in the market.

Development of Polio Vaccines
Source: TH
Why in News?
The wild poliovirus is beginning to reappear in big cities in
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan,
due to
vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, conflict, poverty
, and
limited access
to these isolated regions.
As a result, the
World Health Organization
's Global Polio Eradication Initiative
is set to
miss its deadline of eradicating polio by the end of 2026.
The two vaccines namely
Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)
have helped in nearly eradicating polio from the world.
<img caption="false" class="content-img" src="http://drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1720173912_image15.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650"/>
What is the History of Development of Polio Vaccines?
The development of the 2 polio vaccines - the
Jonas Salk
and the
Albert Sabin
was a result of several key breakthroughs:
Culturing the Poliovirus in Non-Nerve Cells:
In 1948, microbiologists discovered a method to grow the poliovirus in
human muscle
skin cells
, rather than just in nerve cells as was previously believed.
This allowed for the
mass production of the poliovirus
, which was crucial for vaccine research and development.
Development of the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV):
developed the
first successful polio vaccine
growing the poliovirus, inactivating
it and injecting it into test subjects.
The IPV generated systemic immunity, as it was
introduced into the muscle.
Development of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV):
Albert Sabin developed the OPV, which contained
live, weakened poliovirus strains that were administered orally.
The OPV induced a
powerful protective mucosal immune response
in the gut, where the virus begin its infection.
What are Advantages and Disadvantages of IPV and OPV?
Advantages:
IPV is made from
killed or inactivated poliovirus
, which means it cannot cause the disease.
IPV is safe for use in immunocompromised individuals
, as it does not contain live virus.
provides long-lasting immunity
and does not require multiple doses to maintain protection.
Disadvantages:
IPV is more expensive to produce and administer compared to OPV.
IPV requires multiple doses (usually a series of 2-4 shots) to achieve full immunity.
IPV does not provide the same level of mucosal immunity as OPV, which can limit its ability to interrupt the transmission of the virus.
OPV is
less expensive to produce and administer
compared to IPV.
OPV only requires a single or a few doses to provide effective immunity.
OPV can
provide better mucosal immunity,
which helps to interrupt the transmission of the virus.
OPV contains live, weakened poliovirus, which in rare cases can mutate and
cause vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreaks.
not recommended for
, as the live virus can pose a risk.
OPV-derived
immunity may not be as long-lasting as IPV-derived
What are the Key Facts about Polio?
(poliomyelitis)
is a highly infectious
viral disease
that enters the body through the
mouth
multiplying in the intestine
before invading the
nervous system.
It mainly affects children
under 5 years
of age.
The incubation period for poliovirus is usually
7–10 days
, but it can range from 4–35 days.
Initial symptoms of poliovirus infection include
fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness
in the neck, and
pain
in the limbs.
Up to
90%
of those infected with poliovirus experience
no or mild symptoms,
often going unrecognised.
One in 200 infections leads to permanent
paralysis
of the legs, which can occur within a few hours of infection.
5-10% of those paralyzed by polio virus die
when their breathing muscles become immobilised.
The virus is
shed by infected people, usually children, through faeces
, and can spread quickly in areas with poor hygiene and sanitation systems.
Cases due to wild poliovirus have
decreased by over 99% since 1988
, from an estimated
350 000 cases
in more than 125 endemic countries, to just 2 endemic countries
(as of October 2023).
India
received
polio-free certification
by the WHO
in 2014
, after three years of zero cases.
What are the Measures Taken to Eradicate Polio?
Global:
Global Polio Eradication Initiative:
It was launched in
by  national governments and spearheaded by the WHO, Rotary International, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

DBS Brain Implant Surgery for Epilepsy Treatment
Source: IE
Why in News?
Recently, a UK-based teenager has become the first person in the world to be fitted with a
brain implant device
to help bring his
epileptic seizures
under control.
The
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
device was inserted in his skull which reduced his daytime seizures by 80%.
What is Epilepsy Disorder?
About Epilepsy:
It is a
central nervous system (neurological) disorder
in which
brain activity becomes abnormal
, causing seizures or periods of unusual behaviour, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness.
Causes:
It is caused by
abnormal electrical activity
in the brain.
The disease has
no identifiable cause
in nearly 50% of the cases. However,
head trauma, tumours in the brain
, some infections like
meningitis
, or even
genetics
can lead to epilepsy.
It’s more common in young children and older adults. It occurs slightly
more in males
than in females.
Available Treatment of Epilepsy:
Anti-seizure Medications:
These are the first line of treatment, aiming to control seizure frequency and severity..
Ketogenic diet:
high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet
can be remarkably effective, particularly in children with medication-resistant epilepsy.
Epilepsy Surgery:
Doctors can carry out brain surgery to
remove a portion of the brain
where the seizures originate.
Corpus Callosotomy:
In this surgical procedure doctors remove
the corpus callosum (a part that connects both halves of the brain)
that will
not allow abnormal electrical signals to travel
from one half of the brain to another, preventing abnormal electrical discharges from spreading and causing seizures.
What is the DBS Brain Implant Technology to Treat Epilepsy?
About:
involves
implanting a medical device
with electrodes that
deliver mild electrical currents
specific brain regions
linked to seizures.
DBS is considered for patients with
, where traditional medications haven't controlled seizures.
Unlike surgery that removes brain tissue, DBS offers a
more targeted approach
with potentially
fewer side effects.

Overview:
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) recently developed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software named PraVaHa.
About PraVaHa Software:
Parallel RANS Solver for Aerospace Vehicle Aero-thermo-dynamic Analysis
(PraVaHa) is a
developed in
ISRO’s
It can
simulate external and internal flows on launch vehicles
, winged and non-winged re-entry vehicles.
PraVaHa has been
extensively used in
program for aerodynamic analysis of human-rated launch vehicles
, viz, HLVM3, Crew Escape System (CES), and Crew Module (CM).
The software is
secure and flexible
enough to
support collaborative development with academic institutions
and government labs.
Currently
, the PraVaHa code is operational to
simulate airflow for Perfect Gas and Real Gas conditions.
Validations of the code are underway for simulating the effects of chemical reactions that occur during air dissociation upon ‘earth re-entry’ and ‘combustion’ as in scramjet vehicles.
PraVaHa is
expected to replace
most of the
CFD simulations for aero characterisation
, which are currently being
carried out using commercial software
Besides, this software is expected to help academia and other institutions, engaged in the design of missiles, aircraft, and rockets to find solutions to complex aerodynamic problems.
Importance of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):
Initial aerodynamic design studies for launch vehicles
demand evaluation of a large number of configurations.
Any aerospace vehicle
moving
through the Earth’s atmosphere
during launch or re-entry is
subjected to severe aerodynamic and aerothermal loads
in terms of external pressure and heat flux.
Understanding the airflow
around aircraft, rocket bodies, or CM during earth re-entry is
essential to design the shape, structure,
Thermal Protection System (TPS) required
for these bodies.
unsteady part of aerodynamics contributes to serious flow issues
around such rocket bodies and creates
significant acoustic noise
during the mission.
is one such
tool to predict the aerodynamic and aerothermal loads,
which solve numerically the equations of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy along with the equation of state.
Q1: What is aerodynamics?
Aerodynamics is the study of forces and the resulting motion of objects through the air. Studying the motion of air around an object allows us to measure the forces of lift, which allows an aircraft to overcome gravity, and drag, which is the resistance an aircraft “feels” as it moves through the air. Everything moving through the air (including airplanes, rockets, and birds) is affected by aerodynamics.

About High Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS)
Benefits/Advantages of HAPS
Significance w.r.t. India
News Summary
CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) has successfully tested an unmanned aerial vehicle, called High Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS) at Challakere, Karnataka, earlier this month.
<img alt="" src="https://vajiramandravi.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/media/editor_images/2024/2/11/14/38/17/65c88e819d720d05973f7fc8_OI.PNG"/>
Since the 1990s, a number of initiatives have been launched worldwide to explore the potential applications of High Altitude Pseudo Satellites, also called High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS).
HAPS are aircraft positioned above 20 km altitude, in the stratosphere, for very-long-duration flights counted in months and even years.
These unmanned aircraft may be airplanes, airships or balloons.
These solar-powered vehicles have been designed to plug the missing link between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying in lower altitudes and conventional satellites in space.
The use of HAPS is considered for a variety of applications such as:
telecommunications,
emergency/public safety communications,
intelligent transportation systems,
maritime surveillance,
environmental monitoring,
land border control applications, etc.
Compared to ground based communication networks, HAPS can cover larger areas with less interference.
They could also help ease data transfer when used as an intermediate conduit between a satellite and ground based telecom networks.
Unlike regular satellites that are expensive to build and launch, HAPS cost far less and are easier to launch.
In India, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in 2022 had announced that it is developing a “futuristic” high altitude pseudo satellite in collaboration with a start-up company.
With a long and complex land border of about 15,000 km and a coastline of about 7,500 km, safeguarding the borders is crucial for India and necessitates varied solutions.
Hovering at the edge of the Earth’s atmosphere, HAPS can provide services towards efficient border patrolling, tracking movements deep into the enemy territory or in the deep seas with their sharp focus on one area.
Equipped with high-definition optical and infra-red cameras, state-of-the-art sensors, these aerial platforms are suitable for round-the-clock missions, border patrolling, target tracking, maritime surveillance and navigation, and even missile detection.
China’s state-owned aerospace and defense conglomerate, Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), has been working on varied HAPS platforms for surveillance purposes.
In 2018, it successfully tested its solar-powered Morning Star drone which can reportedly stay airborne for months.
The 5-metre-long system, with a wingspan of 11 metres and weighing 23 kg, rose to about 3 km and stayed put for about eight hours.
A series of tests have been planned and they are expected to culminate in a full-bodied craft – with a wingspan of 30m (nearly as much as a Boeing 737) – by 2027.
It will be able to rise to 23 km and stay airborne for at least 90 days.
NAL aims to design and build the HAPS’ propellers, battery management system, carbon-composite airframe, flight-control system, and the high-powered electric motors that can withstand extreme temperature ranges.
Last month, in an unrelated project, a Bengaluru-based private company carried out the first test-flight of a solar-powered, long-endurance drone that flew for 21 hours.
Q1) What is the definition of Stratosphere?
Stratosphere is the layer of the earth’s atmosphere between about 10 and 50 kilometres above the surface of the earth.
Q2) What do you mean by Escape Velocity?
The minimum velocity with which an object can escape the gravitational pull of the planet is called Escape velocity. In the case of earth, escape velocity is the minimum velocity required by a body to be projected to overcome the gravitational pull of the earth.
