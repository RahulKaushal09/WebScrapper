What are the Factors Affecting Remittance Flows to India?
Top Sources of Remittances for India:
Around
36%
of total remittance flows to India are sent by
high-skilled Indian migrants
residing in 3 high-income countries like the
United States, the United Kingdom,
Singapore
The post-pandemic recovery led to a tight labour market in these regions, resulting in wage hikes that boosted remittances.
Among the other high-income destinations for Indian migrants, such as the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
UAE accounted for
18%
of India's remittance flows, while
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar
collectively accounted for
11%
Reason for Consistent Remittance Inflow:
Strong Economic Conditions:
In developed economies like the
US, UK, and Singapore
lower inflation and strong labour markets
have benefited
skilled Indian professionals
increased remittance inflows
to India.
High employment growth
and a
general decrease in inflation
Europe
contributed to the
increase in remittances worldwide
Diversified Migrant Pool:
India's migrant pool is no longer concentrated solely on high-income countries. A significant portion resides in the
, offering a
buffer during economic downturns
in either region.
Favorable economic conditions in GCC, including
high energy prices
curbed food price inflation
have positively impacted employment and incomes for Indian migrants, especially those in
less-skilled sectors
India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
signed a pact in 2023 to establish a
Local Currency Settlement System (LCSS)
to promote the use of the
Indian rupee (INR) and UAE Dirham (AED)
for cross-border transactions further boosting remittance flows.
Improved Remittance Channels:
Initiatives like
Unified Payment Interface (UPI)
enabled real-time fund transfers
, allowing remittances to be sent and received instantly.
National Payments Corporation of India
(NPCI) has
allowed NRIs to use UPI in several countries including Singapore, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Oman, Qatar, USA, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Mauritius, France, Nepal.
How can Remittance Inflow in India be Increased?
Boosting Financial Inclusion:
World Bank data indicates
only 80% of Indians
have bank accounts.
Expanding formal financial services
, especially in rural areas can
facilitate easier remittance transfers
through a wider network of bank branches, ATMs, and digital platforms.
Reducing Remittance Costs: As per
data, India has
high remittance costs (5-6%).
Introducing
competition between remittance service providers
promoting digital channels
lower transaction costs
government incentives
for formal channels can boost adoption.
Enhancing Remittance Infrastructure: Upgrading payment systems
and leveraging new technologies like
blockchain
can streamline the remittance process.
Reserve Bank of India's Centralized Payment System
Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)
National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT)
is a step towards this goal.
Targeted Diaspora Engagement:
Increased government engagement with the Indian diaspora through programs like
Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
Know India Programme
can strengthen connections.
Offering attractive investment options and
tax breaks
, as suggested by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
data can incentivize higher remittance inflows.
Promoting Economic Stability:
Implementing sound macroeconomic policies, improving the ease of doing business, and addressing corruption is crucial for diaspora confidence which can create a more attractive environment for remittance flows .

India is on track to achieve its ambitious target of blending 20% ethanol with petrol by 2025-26, as indicated by recent progress in blending percentages and increasing ethanol production capacities. However, the journey toward this goal is fraught with challenges, particularly concerning the “food versus fuel” debate. Recent developments, such as the surge in maize imports and restrictions on sugarcane-based ethanol, highlight the complexities of balancing energy needs with food security.
Why Adding Ethanol is a Strategic Advantage?
Ethanol’s lower emissions and higher efficiency make it a more sustainable fuel alternative, reducing the need for petroleum imports from West Asian countries. This shift not only contributes to a cleaner environment but also strengthens India’s economic resilience by positively impacting foreign reserves.
The Blending Target: Current Status and Projections
India’s ethanol blending program aims to integrate 20% ethanol with petrol by 2025-26, translating to a production target of approximately 1,000 crore litres of ethanol.
As of now, blending levels have risen from around 8% in 2021 to 13-15% in 2023.
This progress highlights the significant strides made in scaling up ethanol production and integration into the fuel supply chain.

The Food vs. Fuel Dilemma
The “Food vs. Fuel” dilemma in ethanol blending centres on the impact of using food crops like maize and sugarcane for ethanol production, potentially straining food supplies. As India ramps up ethanol blending, balancing the demand for fuel with maintaining food security and managing agricultural resources becomes increasingly complex.
Thus, there is a need to ensure that ethanol production does not come at the expense of food security.
Type of Biofuels
First-Generation Biofuel
Has high carbon content.
Made from edible items, e.g., sugar, corn, starch, etc.
Second-Generation Biofuel
Has a lower greenhouse gas content compared to first-generation biofuel.
Made from leftovers of food crops, e.g., rice husk, wood chips, etc.
Third-Generation Biofuel
Is carbon neutral (CO₂ emitted = CO₂ sequestered).
Produced using microorganisms, e.g., algae.
Fourth-Generation Biofuel
Made from genetically engineered crops.
They are carbon negative.
Note:
Currently, all the emphasis is on first-generation (1G) ethanol, which is directly made from food grains and sugarcane.
The government should diversify and move towards second-generation (2G) and third-generation (3G) ethanol, which have a more benign impact on food security.
Government Policies and Industry Dynamics
The NITI Aayog roadmap outlines a significant increase in both sugarcane-based and grain-based distilleries to meet the ethanol blending targets.
Specifically, sugarcane-based distilleries need to expand from 426 crore litres in 2021 to 760 crore litres by 2026, while grain-based distilleries must grow from 258 to 740 crore litres.
overnment’s interest subvention programs
have been crucial in facilitating this expansion, but there is a call for their extension to sustain momentum and ensure long-term stability.

The Sugarcane Dilemma
Sugarcane produces three main products: sugarcane juice and syrup, B-heavy molasses, and C-heavy molasses, in decreasing order of sugar content. Typically, the first two are used to make sugar, while the third is used for ethanol production.
To boost fuel ethanol production, the government began permitting the diversion of the first two away from sugar production towards fuel ethanol. However
this diversion has led to concerns about the impact on sugar availability.
The government’s recent restrictions on the diversion of B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice highlight the delicate balance needed between ethanol production and sugar supply.
Expanding sugarcane cultivation to meet ethanol demands further exacerbates water use concerns, with potential impacts on agricultural sustainability.
To make up for the shortfall caused by restrictions on B-heavy molasses, grain-based distilleries, primarily using maize, have likely been operating at full capacity to maintain blending percentages.This has led to a shortfall in the availability of maize as well aevident by increased Maize imports  this year.
Increased Maize Imports: A Red Flag?
Recent data reveals a notable increase in maize imports from April to June of this year compared to the previous year.
This rise in imports is largely attributed to the increased use of maize for ethanol production, compensating for restrictions on using sugarcane products.
While the industry maintains that India has ample grain and sugar surpluses, the spike in imports raises concerns about potential imbalances in the food supply chain.
Fuel Efficiency in Automobiles
Ethanol blending not only
reduces greenhouse gas emissions
but also has the
potential to save foreign exchange and support rural economies
However, there are concerns about the impact of higher ethanol content on vehicle performance.
Existing vehicles
may experience a decrease in fuel efficienc
y by an average of 6% when using ethanol blends, raising
questions about the feasibility of achieving the E20 compliance target without affecting vehicle performance.

Uttar Pradesh is leading the country not only in sugar and sugarcane production but also in ethanol production.
Conclusion
India’s ethanol blending program represents a significant step towards sustainable energy use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. However, achieving the 20% blending target requires careful management of the food versus fuel dilemma, the adoption of advanced biofuels, and continued policy support for ethanol production infrastructure. A balanced approach that considers food security, environmental impact, and vehicle performance will be crucial in realising the full potential of this ambitious program.

Poverty and Inequality Measures in India
Source: TH
Why in News?
Recently,
PM’s Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC)
chief Bibek Debroy pitched for a review of India’s official
poverty line
and suggested analysing inequality at the state level.
What is the Status of Poverty in India?
About:
Poverty refers to a condition in which people or communities lack the financial resources and other essentials for a
minimum standard of living.
In September 2022, the
World Bank
set the International Poverty line at
USD 2.15
using
2017 prices.
It means that anyone living on less than
a day is considered to be living in
extreme poverty
Poverty Estimation in India:
Study by VM Dandekar and N Rath (1971):
It made the
first systematic assessment
of poverty in India.
It was based on
National Sample Survey (NSS)
data from 1960-61.
They argued that the
must be derived from the expenditure that was adequate to provide
2250 calories per day
in both rural and urban areas.
Alagh Committee (1979):
It constructed a poverty line for rural and urban areas on the basis of
nutritional requirements
Nutritional requirements and related consumption expenditure based on 1973-74 price levels recommended were
2400 Calories for rural
areas (Rs 49.1 per capita per month) and
2100 Calories for urban
areas (Rs 56.7 per capita per month).
Lakdawala Committee (1993):
It made the following suggestions:
Consumption expenditure should be calculated based on
calorie consumption
as earlier.
State specific poverty lines
should be constructed and these should be
updated
using the Consumer
Price Index of Industrial Workers (CPI-IW)
in urban
areas and
Consumer Price Index of Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL)
in rural areas.
Tendulkar Committee (2005):
It was set up by the
Planning Commission
reassess
methods
estimating poverty
and submitted its report in December 2009.
According to the report, the
rural poverty
headcount ratio for
2004-05
was at
41.8%
25.7%
, and the
pan-India
poverty rate stood at
37.2%
Rangarajan Committee (2012):
It was chaired by former Reserve Bank of India governor C. Rangarajan to review the country's poverty measurement methodology.
It defined poverty as living on
less than Rs 47 per day in urban areas and Rs 32 per day in rural areas.
It estimated that
poverty levels were 19% higher in rural areas and 41% higher in urban areas compared to the Tendulkar Committee's
estimates.
What is the Need of a New Official Poverty Line in India?
Outdated Data:
India's poverty line estimate based on the
is two decades
old.
Estimating poverty on the basis of this data is a
futile exercise
and this grossly underestimates poverty.
Inconsistent with Global Data:
's 2022 report says, India saw "an increase of
56 million poor
people" in 2020 (at USD 2.15) due to the
pandemic
Pew Research Institute
's March 2021 report said the number of Indian poor increased by
75 million
and added that  its middle class shrinking by 32 million.
But India
never acknowledged
that poverty increased due to the pandemic or due to
pre-pandemic
economic shocks of
demonetisation
of 2016 and
GST
of 2017.
Less Realistic Data:
The poverty threshold
varies from state to state
according to people’s social and economic conditions but the current poverty
estimation is based on rural, urban and pan-India level.
This data is
less realistic
inadequate
customised measurement and
inconsistent
data collection methods.
Accuracy Issues:
There is a lack of comprehensive
inflation
data making it impossible to get an accurate picture.
Indian authorities do not provide inflation data segmented by household income.
Multidimensional poverty Index (MDPI)
evaluates
health, education
across 12 indicators. It relies more on
survey-based data
rather than
actual consumption
metrics.
Institutional Issues:
India’s statistical system,
which was applauded globally in the early 1950s,
had been criticised by people outside as well as inside the government system in recent times.
Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation
has
failed
empirical data
and struggled to
effectively communicate its actions
to the relevant stakeholders.
Example:
The findings of the
Consumption Expenditure Survey 2017-18
were so abysmal that they were withdrawn by the government.
What is the Status of Inequality in India?
In the economy, inequality is the
unequal distribution of income and opportunity
between different groups in society.
Income Inequality refers to the
extent to which income is evenly distributed
within a population.
Ways to measure inequality:
Gini coefficient
(Gini index or Gini ratio) is a measure of income inequality, wealth inequality, or consumption inequality within a nation or a social group.
A Gini index of
0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 1 implies perfect inequality.
Inequality in India:
As per the
Household Consumption Expenditure Survey 2022-23
, the value of the Gini coefficient for consumption expenditure
decreased
from 0.283 in 2011-12 to
0.266
areas, and from 0.363 to
0.314
areas in 2022-23.
Way Forward
Institutional Reforms:
Develop a Communication Strategy:
Create a comprehensive communication plan to regularly update stakeholders and the public about MoSPI's activities, methodologies, and data.
Relevant Data:
Conduct periodic reviews of data collection
methods to ensure they are up-to-date and relevant to current needs.
Emerging Issues:
Expand data collection to
cover emerging issues such as digital economy metrics, environmental statistics,
and social welfare indicators.
Align with Global Practices:
Consultative Committees:
Form consultative committees with representatives from academia, industry, and civil society to provide feedback and guidance on statistical methods and data dissemination.
Public Feedback Mechanisms:
Implement mechanisms for
public feedback on MoSPI’s publications and activities to ensure continuous improvement.
Conclusion
are deeply
interconnected
issues that affect societies worldwide, hindering social and economic progress. Addressing these challenges requires a
multifaceted approac
h that includes
equitable
economic policies, access to quality education, healthcare, and social protection. India needs to address data uncertainties by establishing a more accurate and reliable measure of the poverty line and the number of people living in poverty. A revamping of poverty data for equitable distribution of income will be a step in the right direction.
Q. Drishti Mains Question:
What are the issues involved in estimation of poverty in India? What need to be done for wider acceptance of Indian statistical data?
