La Nina
Climate change is intensifying, and the cooling effects of La Niña may weaken in a warmer future, climate scientists warn, citing current heat trends across much of the country.
About La Nina:
La Niña is a climate pattern that describes the
cooling of surface-ocean waters
along the tropical west coast of South America.
It is considered to be the
counterpart to El Niño
, which is characterized by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean.
Together, La Niña and El Niño are the "cold" (La Niña) and "warm" (El Niño) phases of the
El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
. ENSO is series of linked weather- and ocean-related phenomena.
La Niña events are indicated by sea-surface temperature decreases of more than 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least five successive three-month seasons.
Causes:
La Niña is caused by a build-up of
cooler-than-normal waters
in the tropical Pacific, the area of the Pacific Ocean between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.
Unusually strong, eastward-moving trade winds and ocean currents bring this cold water to the surface, a process known as upwelling. Upwelling can cause a drastic drop in sea-surface temperature.
Effects:
Impact on Air Pressure and Rainfall:
La Niña lowers air pressure over the western Pacific, leading to increased rainfall. South Asia experiences stronger summer monsoons, benefiting agriculture in India and Bangladesh.
Risk of Flooding in Australia:
While La Niña supports agriculture in South Asia, strong events can cause severe flooding in northern Australia due to excessive rainfall and low-pressure systems.
Global Rainfall Patterns:
La Niña brings more rain to southeastern Africa and northern Brazil. In contrast, it increases air pressure over the central and eastern Pacific, causing dry conditions.
Drier Conditions in Some Regions:
Regions like the west coast of tropical South America, the Gulf Coast of the US, and the pampas of South America experience reduced rainfall and dry spells during La Niña.
Boost to the Fishing Industry:
Upwelling caused by La Niña brings cold, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, supporting plankton growth. This benefits fish populations and predators like sea bass.
Duration and Seasonal Peak:
La Niña events usually last between one and three years, whereas El Niño typically lasts less than a year. Both tend to peak during the Northern Hemisphere winter.

**********Trade-to-Trade (T2T) Segment in Stock Markets
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is considering a major revamp of short-selling regulations, potentially allowing it for all stocks excluding those in the trade-to-trade (T2T) segment.
About Trade-to-Trade (T2T) Segment:
T2T stocks or Trade-to-Trade stock means
stocks that must be delivered in order to be traded
(T+2 settlement).
This implies that such equities
cannot be traded intraday
or, in the case of Buy Today Sell Tomorrow, on a daily basis.
This means
if you acquire T2T stocks
today, you
won’t be able to sell them until the settlement takes place.
Your o
rder will be refused if you try to sell
these shares the
same day or before they are in the Demat account.
Stocks are put under the T2T
segment by the exchanges
based on criteria
such as their
price-earnings ratio, price variations, market capitalisation
, etc.
Stocks that are very volatile
or have
irregular price movements
are monitored by exchanges in cooperation with the market regulator, SEBI.
They
put stocks in the T2T section to shield regular investors from
being caught up in the
volatility
and to
limit unwarranted speculation
on such equities.
On a bi-weekly basis, exchanges relocate stocks to the T2T section,
and they are
shifted in and out
of the segment depending on quarterly evaluations.
Also evaluated for transfer to the T2T sector are stocks that are not available for trade in the Futures & Options section.
How to identify stocks in the T2T segment?
Stocks in the T2T segment can be identified by changes in their scrip names:
National Stock Exchange (NSE):
addition of the word "BE" to the scrip name.
For example, "ADANIPOWER" becomes
"ADANIPOWER BE"
in the T2T segment and reverts to "ADANIPOWER" after normal trading is allowed.
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE):
addition of the letter "T" to the scrip name
. For instance, "ADANIPOWER" changes to "ADANIPOWER T" when moved to the T2T segment.

**********Rise of Quick Commerce
Why in news?
Quick commerce emerged during the COVID-19 lockdown to serve customers but has since evolved to reshape urban shopping habits.
What’s in today’s article?
Quick commerce, or Q-commerce
Benefits of Quick Commerce for Brands
Impact on Traditional Retailers
Challenges Faced by the Quick Commerce Industry
Regulations and Transparency in Quick Commerce
The Fast Future of Q-commerce
Quick commerce, or Q-commerce, is a type of e-commerce that delivers orders in a very short time, often within an hour. It's also known as "on-demand delivery".
How Quick Commerce Functions
Rapid Delivery System
Q-commerce ensures ultra-fast delivery (10–20 minutes) by leveraging a network of dark stores and distribution centers.
These warehouses, dedicated solely to online orders, are strategically placed near consumers to enable faster deliveries.
Data-Driven Customization
Unlike traditional retail, Q-commerce platforms use mobile apps to collect and analyze customer data.
This feedback loop helps in personalizing the shopping experience, optimizing inventory management, and predicting product demand based on seasonal trends or demographic shifts.
Some Q-commerce companies in India
Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy InstaMart, BigBasket Now, Flipkart Minutes, Dunzo Daily, Amazon Fresh, and M-Now (Myntra).
Enhanced Brand Awareness
Quick commerce helps retailers increase brand visibility due to its widespread adoption and growing consumer base.
Availability of Low-Cost Workforce
The sector benefits from an easily employable workforce, particularly from specific age and economic groups, improving operational efficiency.
Supply-Side Advantages
Q-commerce platforms offer cost-effective distribution, eliminating the need for individual brands to invest in expensive storage solutions, such as freezers for chilled products.
Rapid Market Growth
The Indian quick commerce market, currently valued at $3.34 billion, is projected to reach $9.95 billion by 2029, growing at a rate of 76% YoY in FY 2024.
Allegations of Anti-Competitive Practices
Various organizations have accused quick commerce platforms (Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart) of engaging in anti-competitive behavior.
Predatory Pricing and Deep Discounting
Platforms allegedly set product prices below cost to drive out competitors and later increase prices to recover losses.
Their access to venture capital and foreign investments gives them an unfair advantage.
Concerns Over Differential Pricing
Quick commerce platforms are accused of using customer data to adjust prices based on location, device type, and shopping behavior, further disadvantaging traditional retailers.
Threat to Small Retailers
Traditional retailers struggle to compete, leading to the closure or financial distress of millions of small shops and distributors.
Call for a Level Playing Field
Industry representatives emphasize the need for fair competition where both quick commerce platforms and traditional retailers can coexist.
Slowdown in Growth
The hypergrowth of quick commerce is slowing as investors shift focus post-pandemic.
Companies all over the world are downsizing due to reduced capital investment.
Traffic and Safety Concerns
Urban congestion and safety risks pose challenges. In cities like New York, authorities are considering banning 15-minute deliveries to prevent reckless driving.
Government Regulations:
India’s 2023 guidelines prohibit deceptive practices by platforms, advertisers, and sellers, aiming to curb dark patterns.
Challenges in Enforcement:
Despite regulations, enforcement remains difficult, and new deceptive tactics continue to emerge.
Need for Transparency:
As quick commerce expands, clear pricing, honest advertising, and user-centric designs are essential to ensure fairness.
The Hidden Cost:
Without proper regulation, the convenience of rapid deliveries may come at the expense of consumer rights and ethical business practices.
The COVID-19 pandemic changed consumer shopping habits, with many still preferring online shopping for convenience.
While quick commerce accelerated during the pandemic, it was already gaining traction before.
Digital natives now expect instant delivery, making quick commerce a permanent part of eCommerce.
With advancing technology, more eCommerce brands will adopt quick commerce, offering deliveries in minutes.

**********India - Mauritius Ties
Why in news?
PM Narendra Modi will visit Mauritius for two days, marking his second visit since 2015. He will be the Chief Guest at Mauritius’ National Day celebrations on March 12.
What’s in today’s article?
Mauritius: A Key Indian Ocean Neighbour
Early Diplomatic Ties
Infrastructure Development in Agaléga
Key Focus Areas of India-Mauritius Ties
Mauritius, a strategically located island nation in the western Indian Ocean, shares strong ties with India, as nearly 70% of its 1.2 million population is of Indian origin.
Geographical location
Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar, and off the southeast coast of Africa.
It is considered part of Africa geographically.
It's located in the Southern Hemisphere, just above the Tropic of Capricorn.
Colonial History and Indian Migration
Originally a French colony, Mauritius later came under British rule.
During French rule in the 1700s, Indians from Puducherry were brought as artisans and masons.
Under British rule,
around 500,000 Indian indentured workers arrived between 1834 and the early 1900s, with two-thirds settling permanently
Indian Connection to National Day
Mahatma Gandhi visited Mauritius in 1901 and inspired Indian workers with messages on education, political empowerment, and staying connected with India.
As a tribute, Mauritius celebrates its National Day on March 12, coinciding with Gandhi’s Dandi March.
Mauritius was among the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with independent India in 1948. It gained independence from British rule in 1968.
Political Leadership
Mauritius has been largely governed by two major political families—the Ramgoolams (Seewoosagur Ramgoolam and his son Navin) and the Jugnauths (Anerood Jugnauth and his son Pravind).
Navin Ramgoolam, who won the elections last year, has previously served as Prime Minister twice (1995–2000, 2005–2014).
Freedom Struggle and Indian Connection
Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the first Prime Minister of independent Mauritius, played a key role in the country’s freedom movement.
He worked closely with Indian leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Sarojini Naidu.
He also had strong ties with Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and even proofread Bose’s book, The Indian Struggle (1934).
During PM Modi’s visit to Mauritius in 2015, India signed an MoU to enhance transport facilities on Agaléga island, improving sea and air connectivity.
These developments aim to support the Mauritian Defence Forces in safeguarding their outer islands.
In February 2024, both countries jointly inaugurated an airstrip and jetty projects.
Sovereignty Concerns and Clarifications
Speculations about India building a military base in Agaléga were dismissed by then PM Pravind Jugnauth, who reaffirmed Mauritius' sovereignty over the island and condemned anti-India narratives.
China Factor and Strategic Importance
With China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean, India seeks to strengthen ties with island nations like Mauritius to maintain regional stability and security.
Disaster Response and Maritime Security
Following Cyclone Chido, India deployed naval assets to deliver aid to Agaléga.
The new infrastructure also supports Mauritius in maritime surveillance, patrolling its Exclusive Economic Zone, and tackling piracy, drug trafficking, and other security threats.
Defence and Maritime Security
India and Mauritius aim to enhance defence cooperation, with plans to sign a technical agreement for sharing white-shipping information.
This will improve maritime security, protect trading routes, and strengthen regional data-sharing.
Indian Development Projects
India has provided nearly $1.1 billion in development assistance to Mauritius over the last decade, including $729 million in lines of credit and $427 million in grants.
Key projects include three phases of the Metro Express and 96 small-scale infrastructure initiatives, of which 51 have been completed.
India as a First Responder
India has consistently supported Mauritius during crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the Wakashio oil spill in 2020, and a recent cyclone, reinforcing its role as a reliable partner.
Trade and Investment
Mauritius is a major economic partner, ranking as the second-largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India after Singapore.
The two countries signed the
Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement in 2021,
India's first trade deal with an African nation
Several Indian PSUs, including Bank of Baroda, LIC, and NBCC, operate in Mauritius.
Space Cooperation
India and Mauritius have collaborated in space research since 1986.
In 2023, ISRO and the Mauritius Research and Innovation Council (MRIC) signed an MoU to develop a joint satellite, further strengthening space ties.
Capacity Building and Education
Mauritius is a significant beneficiary of India’s ITEC programme, with around 4,940 Mauritians trained since 2002-03.
Additionally, 2,300 Indian students are pursuing higher education in Mauritius in fields such as medicine, hotel management, and business studies.
Cultural and Historical Connections
The visit will highlight the legacy of Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, whose ancestors were from Bihar, and celebrate shared cultural traditions, including Maha Shivratri and the Ganga Talao pilgrimage site.

**********Chandrayaan-3’s Findings Suggest Water-Ice Beyond the Moon’s Polar Regions
Why in the News?
In a new study, researchers from the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad have found that the area of the moon where water ice can be easily accessed is greater than expected.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Chandrayaan-3 (Introduction, Scientific Contributions, Presence of Water, Significance, Implications, etc.)
India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission has made a ground-breaking discovery regarding the presence of water-ice on the Moon.
Previously believed to exist primarily in the Moon’s polar craters, new research based on data from the
Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment
(ChaSTE) suggests that water-ice might also be present in high-latitude regions beyond the poles.
This revelation has major implications for future lunar exploration, as it could make water more accessible for human missions and space-based activities.
Chandrayaan-3 and Its Scientific Contributions
Role of ChaSTE in Lunar Research
The ChaSTE instrument, onboard the Vikram lander, was designed to measure surface and sub-surface temperatures of the Moon.
It provided the first-ever in-situ temperature readings from high-latitude lunar regions.
The findings revealed that even slight changes in altitude and slope orientation could result in significant temperature variations, creating potential environments similar to polar regions where water-ice can accumulate.
Unexpected Temperature Variations
High Surface Temperatures:
The ChaSTE data showed that sun-facing slopes recorded temperatures as high as
82°C (355 K)
at the Shiv Shakti point, where the Vikram lander had touched down.
Cold Shaded Areas:
In contrast, just a meter away on a flat surface, the temperature dropped to
59°C (332 K)
. The temperature varied drastically based on the inclination and exposure to sunlight.
Extreme Night-time Cooling:
At night, temperatures plummeted to
-181°C
, confirming the Moon’s vast thermal differences.
Potential Presence of Water-Ice Beyond the Poles
Key Observations from the Study
Scientists found that slopes tilted more than
14° away from the Sun
maintained much lower temperatures, creating an environment where
water-ice could migrate and stabilize beneath the surface.
The study indicates that water-ice may
not be confined to polar craters
but could also exist in other high-latitude regions, particularly in shadowed areas.
Significance of this Discovery
Greater Accessibility for Space Missions
Polar regions pose technical challenges for landings due to rugged terrain and constant shadow.
High-latitude locations are easier to reach and explore, making water extraction more feasible.
Supports Long-Term Lunar Habitation
Water on the Moon is crucial for drinking, sanitation, and growing food for astronauts.
Water-ice can also be
converted into oxygen and hydrogen
, providing breathable air and fuel for space travel.
Commercial and Scientific Potential
The ability to extract water locally reduces the need to transport it from Earth, making
lunar missions more sustainable and cost-effective.
The findings contribute to a
better understanding of the Moon’s evolution
and the behaviour of volatile substances in space.
Implications for Future Lunar Exploration
Chandrayaan-3’s discovery aligns with global lunar exploration efforts, including NASA’s
Artemis program
, China’s plans for a
lunar base
, and Russia’s lunar lander missions.
With more accessible water-ice deposits, India’s future lunar missions can now focus on resource utilization, setting the stage for
permanent human presence on the Moon.
Conclusion:
Chandrayaan-3’s findings have significantly expanded our understanding of the Moon’s water distribution.
The revelation that water-ice may exist beyond the poles
reshapes lunar exploration strategies
and enhances the feasibility of
future human settlements on the Moon.
By identifying high-latitude regions with favourable conditions, ISRO’s mission contributes not only to India’s space aspirations but also to the broader
global efforts of deep-space colonization and resource utilization.

. No front-of-pack warning labels exist despite growing health risks.
The flawed Indian Nutrition Rating (INR) system:
Proposed in September 2022 by FSSAI,
modeled after Australia’s failed ‘health star’ system
, it assigns 1 to 5 stars to packaged foods based on nutritional content.
Criticism:
Misleading consumers
by creating a false ‘health halo’ around unhealthy foods.
To support the rating system, the FSSAI cited
a study from IIM Ahmedabad
, which it
never critically examined
Food industry representatives dominated
key stakeholder meetings and members of the scientific panel were sidelined.
The FSSAI ignored its own 2021 draft regulations
indicating ‘traffic light’ colour-coded and mandatory warning labels and instead bowed down to industry lobbying.
Example of misclassification:
Soft drinks
with high sugar content may get 2 stars instead of a warning label.
Cornflakes
(high in sugar and sodium) get 3 stars, misleading consumers.
Ineffective advertising regulations:
India has
four laws regulating advertising of HFSS
(High Fat, Salt, Sugar) foods, but none are effective.
Consumer Protection Act, 2019:
Defines misleading advertisements but does not mandate nutritional disclosure.
National Multisectoral Action Plan (2017)
: Recommended stricter HFSS advertising rules, but no action was taken.
Loophole:
Advertisements do not disclose sugar/salt/fat content, allowing brands to target children.
Global Best Practices and Recommendations:
Chile’s
‘High In’ Warning Labels: Reduced UPF consumption by 24%.
World Health Organization (
WHO
) guidelines recommend clear front-of-pack warning labels.
The Way Forward:
Implement front-of-pack warning labels:
Scrap the INR system and replace it with mandatory ‘High in Sugar/Salt/Fat’ warnings.
Define and regulate UPFs and HFSS foods:
Establish clear sugar/salt/fat limits based on WHO and Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition
(ICMR-NIN)
Strengthen advertising regulations:
Amend existing laws or introduce a comprehensive advertising ban on HFSS/UPFs. Harmonize regulations across multiple laws for consistency.
Public awareness campaigns:
Launch a national campaign in multiple languages to educate people on the health risks of UPFs.
Conclusion:
Obesity in India is
a policy failure
, not a public failure.
Weak and subjective labelling and advertising laws
have let junk food giants enjoy the freedom to make profits at the expense of public health.
The Economic Survey provides a roadmap,
but urgent regulatory action is needed.

Editorial Analysis
**********An India-U.S. Trade Agreement and the Test of WTO Laws
Context
The
recent decision by India and the United States to negotiate a multi-sector Bilateral Trade
Agreement (BTA)
by the fall of 2025 marks a
significant development
in global trade relations.
While such agreements primarily focus on economic benefits,
it is essential to analyse them through the lens of international trade law
, particularly the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (
GATT
) and World Trade Organization (
) regulations.
Therefore,
it is crucial to examine the legal implications of the proposed BTA, the distinction between BTAs and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs),
and the necessity for compliance with WTO principles.
Understanding Free Trade Agreements under WTO Law
The WTO operates on the
Most Favoured Nation (MFN)
principle, which mandates equal treatment for all trading partners.
FTAs, however, provide an exception to this principle,
allowing participating nations to grant each other preferential trade benefits.
According to
Article XXIV.8(b) of the GATT
, FTAs must eliminate tariffs and trade barriers on ‘
substantially all the trade
’ between the participating countries.
Though the term is not precisely defined,
it generally implies a high percentage of trade coverage.
Since the
proposed India-U.S. BTA is not labelled as an FTA
, its scope remains unclear.
If
it does not eliminate tariffs on a broad range of goods and services,
it risks violating WTO law unless justified under specific provisions.
Thus,
the negotiation process must ensure that the agreement either qualifies as an FTA or complies with WTO exceptions.
Legal Considerations for the India-US BTA
Compliance with the MFN Principle
One of the most significant legal hurdles
for the India-U.S. BTA is ensuring that
it does not violate the MFN principle
, which is a cornerstone of the WTO’s multilateral trade system.
MFN principle,
enshrined in Article I of the GATT,
requires that all WTO members treat each other equally in terms of trade policies.
In practical terms,
this means that any preferential treatment granted to one country must also be extended to all other WTO members.
In the context of the BTA,
if India and the U.S. agree to reduce tariffs
on a limited set of products, this reduction may
constitute preferential treatment.
However,
for the agreement to comply with WTO rules, this preferential treatment cannot be limited to only these two countries
; rather, the benefits must be extended to all other WTO members as well.
If India and the U.S. decide to reduce tariffs only for each other’s products, without offering similar reductions or access to other WTO members, it would
Structure of the BTA: Is it an FTA or Something Else?
As the
India-U.S. BTA is not explicitly labelled as a FTA
in the Joint Leaders Statement, it is crucial to understand
the legal distinction between a BTA and an FTA in WTO law.
An FTA, under Article XXIV of the GATT, allows countries to reduce or eliminate tariffs
and trade barriers within the agreement’s scope, but
such agreements must adhere to the rule
that they eliminate trade barriers on substantially all the trade between the parties.
phrase ‘substantially all the trade’ is not defined in the agreement
, but generally, it implies a significant portion of trade, often considered to mean around 90% or more of the total trade between the members of the FTA.
If the India-U.S. BTA does not aim to cover ‘substantially all trade’ between the two countries, it would fail to meet the requirements of an FTA
and could run afoul of WTO rules.
Interim Agreements: Article XXIV’s Flexibility
To navigate the challenge of non-compliance with the MFN principle,
India and the U.S. may consider structuring the BTA as an interim agreement.
Under Article XXIV.5 of the GATT,
countries can enter into an interim agreement that facilitates the creation of an FTA.
This
provision allows nations to reduce tariffs and trade barriers in phases
, with the goal of eventually forming a full-fledged FTA within a reasonable timeframe, generally not exceeding 10 years.
An interim agreement would allow India and the U.S. to engage in tariff reductions
and other trade liberalization measures while working toward a more comprehensive FTA.
Potential WTO Violations and Political Considerations
If India and the U.S. enter into a BTA that reduces tariffs on a limited number of goods or provides preferential access only to each other’s markets,
it could violate the WTO’s rules against discrimination.
situation would lead to significant legal challenges
, especially if other countries feel that they are being excluded from these benefits.
challenge for India lies in navigating the delicate balance of achieving a mutually beneficial agreement
with the U.S. without undermining its commitments to the WTO and its stance on multilateral trade.
Moreover,
India faces political pressure to ensure that any such agreement does not lead to the weakening of its trade policy
or compromise its position in the global trading system.
The Way Ahead
The Need for Compliance with WTO Principles
Historically, the U.S. has taken an aggressive approach to trade policy.
U.S. President Donald Trump’s concept of
‘reciprocal tariffs’
sought to impose higher tariffs on imports from countries that had higher tariffs on American goods.
This approach directly conflicts with WTO principles such as MFN and
Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT)
, which allow developing nations to maintain lower tariff commitments in recognition of their economic constraints.
Moreover, reciprocal tariffs could breach the
U.S.’s bound tariff rate obligations
, which cap the maximum tariffs it can impose under WTO commitments.
For India, the proposed BTA represents a test of its commitment to a
rules-based international trading system
As a nation that has traditionally championed WTO principles,
India must ensure that its trade agreements comply with multilateral rules
and do not set a precedent for arbitrary bilateral deals that undermine WTO norms.
Need to Remain Vigilant
must remain vigilant
against any attempts to dilute core WTO principles
such as MFN and S&DT.
As a key player in global trade
, India’s approach to this agreement will reflect its commitment to a fair and transparent trading system.
strategic and legally compliant negotiations are imperative
to ensure that the BTA strengthens, rather than undermines, the global trade framework.
Conclusion
India-U.S. BTA negotiations present both opportunities and challenges.
While the agreement could enhance economic ties and promote trade,
it must be structured carefully to align with WTO regulations.
If the BTA is intended as a precursor to a full-fledged FTA, it should be designed as a legally sound
if it simply aims to lower tariffs on selective products without broader commitments, it risks violating WTO laws
unless appropriate justifications are made.

Editorial Analysis
**********The Indian University and the Search for a V-C
Context
Draft University Grants Commission
(Minimum Qualifications for Appointment and Promotion of Teachers and Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education)
Regulations, 2025
, has sparked widespread debate.
The primary concerns
revolve around two key aspects:
the method of appointing Vice-Chancellors (V-Cs) and the broadening of the qualifications
required for this esteemed academic position.
These
concerns need to be analysed in light of India’s evolving federal structure
and the legal precedents set by the Supreme Court.
The Most Debated Aspect of the Draft UGC Regulations, 2025: Reducing the Role of the State Executive in V-C Appointments
The appointment of V-Cs in Indian universities has
long been a contentious issue,
primarily due to the involvement of state governments in the selection process.
Historically,
state legislatures and executives have played a significant role
in these appointments, often using them as an extension of political influence over higher education.
However,
a series of Supreme Court judgments have sought to reduce the role of the state executive,
ensuring that the selection process remains independent, merit-based, and free from undue political interference.
The Draft UGC Regulations, 2025, reflect these judicial rulings
by proposing a search-cum-selection committee structure that significantly limits state intervention.
New Selection Structure Under the 2025 Regulations
The Draft UGC Regulations, 2025, propose
that the search-cum-selection committee should be composed of highly qualified individuals
with substantial academic leadership experience.
The recommended composition includes:
A nominee of the Chancellor of the university
(often the Governor in state universities).
A nominee of the executive body of the university
(e.g., the Senate or Board of Governors).
A nominee of the UGC.
Notably absent from this list are representatives from the state executive,
a clear departure from previous practices where state governments could appoint their nominees
to these committees.
intention behind this restructuring is to ensure academic independence
, preventing politically motivated appointments that could compromise the quality and integrity of higher education institutions.
Judicial Precedents
Gambhirdan K. Gadhvi vs The State of Gujarat (2019):
The Court held that any influence exerted by the state executive in the appointment of V-Cs is unconstitutional, as it compromises the autonomy of higher education institutions.
Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee case (2022):
This case further established that the state government should not have discretionary power in V-C selection, reinforcing the idea that academic leadership should be insulated from political interference.
Professor (Dr.) Sreejith P.S vs Dr. Rajasree M.S. (2022):
The Court invalidated an appointment where the selection process was found to be influenced by the state government, setting a precedent that such appointments should be purely merit-based.
Dr. Premachandran Keezhoth vs The Chancellor, Kannur University (2023):
The judgment in this case reaffirmed that the presence of state executive members in the search-cum-selection committee renders the appointment process ab initio void (invalid from the beginning), irrespective of the appointee’s qualifications.
State Government’s Perspective and Concerns
Financial and Administrative Responsibility
state universities rely heavily on funding from state governments
for their operation, infrastructure development, and faculty salaries.
Given their financial stake,
state governments argue that they should have a role in selecting leadership
that aligns with regional education priorities.
Regional and Policy Priorities
Unlike central universities, which cater to a national audience,
state universities are deeply integrated into their local communities.
They
play a critical role in state-driven research,
workforce development, and social advancement.
State governments worry that if they lose control over V-C appointments,
universities may become disconnected from regional developmental goals.
Balance Between Autonomy and Accountability
State governments believe that
while universities should have autonomy in academic matters, they must also remain accountable to public policy goals.
accountability, they argue, is best maintained through some level of state
involvement in leadership selection
Possible Solutions to Address the Concerns of Both Judiciary and State Governments
Consensus-Based Nomination from University Executives
One way to ensure state participation
without violating judicial precedents is to allow the university’s executive body
(e.g., Senate, Board of Governors) to nominate a search committee member. This nominee could be:
A former eminent academic who has previously served as a V-C
or held a similar leadership role.
Someone informally approved by the state executive
but not a direct government official or political appointee.
This approach would
maintain academic neutrality
while still allowing state interests to be considered in the selection process.
Limited State Representation in Selection Committees
An
alternative approach would be for the UGC to allow one nominee from the state government on the search-cum-selection committee
, in addition to the representative from the university executive.
However, to ensure fairness, this nominee should:
Be a former V-C or an equivalent academic leader rather
than a government bureaucrat or political figure.
Meet the same standards of independence
required of members of commissions such as the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).
The Way Forward: Avoiding a Confrontational Approach
A complete exclusion of state governments
from the V-C selection process could lead to
political and legal conflicts
States might resist implementing the new regulations, leading to
prolonged disputes
that could hinder university governance.
Instead of creating a
collision course
between the judiciary and state governments, it is essential to find
a cooperative approach
that respects both judicial mandates and state interests.
Conclusion
, mark a significant shift in the governance of higher education, reinforcing the principle of independent and merit-based Vice-Chancellor appointments.
While
the Supreme Court has established clear legal precedents against state executive involvement,
state governments have legitimate concerns
regarding their role in shaping higher education institutions that they fund and manage.
The challenge lies in
striking a balance
, ensuring that universities remain free from political interference while also recognizing the state’s stake in higher education.

Today’s editorial discusses how the ongoing Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) negotiations may affect both countries. This information is useful for
GS Paper 3
in the UPSC Mains exam.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Since both the
U.S. and India
are members of the
World Trade Organization
, their trade agreements must follow WTO rules.
What are the key legal challenges India and the U.S. may face while negotiating a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) under WTO law?
Violation of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) Principle:
WTO law mandates that any trade advantage granted to one member must be extended to all members (Article I of GATT). A BTA providing preferential tariffs only to India or the U.S. may violate this principle.
Example:
If the U.S. lowers tariffs on Indian textiles under the BTA without extending the same benefit to other WTO members like China, it breaches the MFN principle.
Meeting the “Substantially All Trade” Requirement:
Article XXIV.8(b) of GATT requires that Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) must cover “substantially all trade.” A limited-scope BTA focusing only on select sectors (e.g., pharmaceuticals or agriculture) may not satisfy this condition.
If the India-U.S. BTA only includes technology and defense products while excluding key areas like agriculture, it may not qualify as a valid FTA under WTO law.
Notification and Transparency Obligations:
WTO members must notify the organization of any new regional trade agreements (RTAs) or BTAs and demonstrate compliance with Article XXIV of GATT. Failure to provide transparent schedules may lead to legal disputes.
If India and the U.S. do not submit a clear implementation timeline for tariff reductions under an interim BTA, other WTO members could challenge the agreement.
Bound Tariff Commitments:
Both countries have pre-committed to maximum tariff limits (bound tariffs) under WTO rules. Any preferential treatment exceeding these limits may violate their commitments.
If India agrees to reduce tariffs on American agricultural imports below its bound tariff rates, it could be accused of breaching its WTO commitments.
Misuse of the “Interim Agreement” Clause:
Article XXIV.5 allows “interim agreements” only if they lead to a full FTA within a reasonable period (usually 10 years). Using an interim BTA to delay full liberalization may face legal scrutiny.
If the India-U.S. BTA remains a partial agreement for an extended period without progressing toward an FTA, it could be deemed a violation of WTO norms.
Why is the “most favoured nation” (MFN) principle significant in evaluating the legality of the proposed India-U.S. BTA?
Prevents Discrimination Between Trading Partners:
The MFN principle under
ensures that any trade advantage (e.g., lower tariffs) given to one WTO member must be extended to all members. A BTA offering exclusive benefits violates this core principle.
If the U.S. reduces tariffs on Indian pharmaceuticals but does not extend the same reduction to other countries like Vietnam, it breaches the MFN rule.
Limits Preferential Bilateral Deals:
WTO law only allows exceptions to the MFN rule through comprehensive trade agreements covering
“substantially all trade”
of GATT. A narrowly focused BTA risks legal challenges.
If India and the U.S. sign a BTA that only includes high-tech products while excluding major sectors like agriculture, it may not qualify for an MFN exemption.
Ensures Transparency and Fair Competition:
The MFN principle promotes a
transparent, rule-based
trading system where no country receives hidden advantages, ensuring fair market access for all WTO members.
If India provides exclusive tariff cuts on American dairy products without offering similar terms to New Zealand, it would violate WTO transparency obligations.
Prevents Trade Fragmentation:
Upholding the MFN principle avoids
trade fragmentation
by ensuring consistent rules for all members. Bilateral deals that bypass MFN could undermine the multilateral trade system.
If the U.S. grants Indian textiles preferential access through a BTA but not to countries like Bangladesh, it could distort global supply chains.
Requires WTO Notification and Review:
Any departure from the MFN principle through a BTA must be
notified
to the WTO and subjected to legal scrutiny under
to confirm its compliance.
If the India-U.S. BTA is not notified to the WTO or lacks a clear transition plan toward an FTA, it may be legally contested by other members like China or the EU.
How can the proposed BTA be structured as an “interim agreement” under Article XXIV of the GATT without violating WTO norms?
Commitment to Full Free Trade Area (FTA) or Customs Union:
The BTA must outline a clear plan to eventually form a
reasonable time frame
(generally within 10 years).
: The
India-Mauritius Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement (CECPA)
started as an interim agreement with the goal of expanding into a broader trade framework.
Transparency and Notification to WTO:
The parties must notify the WTO of the interim agreement and submit
detailed information
on trade coverage, timelines, and implementation steps for review by the
Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA)
European Union (EU)-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement
was notified to the WTO during the Brexit transition, ensuring compliance with Article XXIV.
Non-Discriminatory Transition:
The interim agreement must not create
unjustifiable discrimination
against other WTO members, and the removal of
trade barriers
should cover
between the parties.
US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
complies with this by covering a broad range of goods and services, ensuring that trade barriers are progressively reduced.
Way forward:
Ensure Comprehensive Coverage and Timely Transition:
Design the BTA to cover
sectors with a
clear roadmap
full Free Trade Area (FTA)
within the
10-year
WTO guideline to comply with
Enhance Transparency and Legal Compliance:
Notify the WTO promptly, providing
detailed schedules
on tariff reductions and
implementation timelines
non-discrimination
and regular
compliance reviews

Regulation in education institutions;
Why in the News?
Various groups have raised concerns about the
Draft UGC Regulations, 2025,
which outline qualifications for appointing and promoting university teachers and aim to maintain standards in higher education.
What are the primary reservations expressed regarding the Draft UGC Regulations, 2025?
Reduced Role of State Executives in V-C Appointments:
The draft regulations limit the State government’s involvement in the search-cum-selection process, despite State universities being funded and established by State legislatures.
Example:
In the
Gambhirdan K. Gadhvi vs State of Gujarat (2019)
case, the Supreme Court ruled that State executive members cannot be part of the V-C selection committee, reducing their influence.
Broadening of Eligibility Criteria for Vice-Chancellors:
Expanding the eligibility to include individuals from public policy, government, and private sectors may dilute academic rigor and expertise.
Between
2010 and 2018
, the UGC regulations required 10 years of professorship or equivalent academic experience, ensuring a focus on research-based qualifications.
Why has the Supreme Court of India ruled against the involvement of the State executive in the selection process of Vice-Chancellors?
Ensuring Compliance with UGC Regulations:
The Court upheld the
UGC’s 2018 regulations
, which specify that only a UGC representative, not a State executive member, should be included in the search-cum-selection committee.
Professor (Dr.) Sreejith P.S vs Dr. Rajasree M.S. (2022)
, the Court invalidated the V-C’s appointment because the selection process did not follow UGC norms.
Preventing Arbitrary Appointments:
The Court held that allowing State executives to influence the selection process could lead to biased or politically motivated appointments, compromising merit-based selection.
Dr. Premachandran Keezhoth vs The Chancellor, Kannur University (2023)
, the Court declared the V-C appointment void due to the involvement of the State executive, reinforcing the need for an independent selection process.
Preserving Autonomy and Neutrality:
The Court emphasized that the Vice-Chancellor’s appointment process should be free from political or administrative influence to maintain the academic institution’s autonomy and impartiality.
, the Court ruled that State executive members cannot be part of the selection committee to prevent undue influence.
Who are the key stakeholders affected by the proposed changes in the search-cum-selection process?
State Governments and State Universities:
The reduced role of State executives limits their ability to shape the leadership of State-funded universities, affecting regional educational priorities and innovation.
State governments argue that universities play a critical role in addressing
local development needs
, which may be overlooked if the selection process is centralized.
University Governance Bodies:
University executive bodies lose direct influence over the V-C selection, reducing their ability to align leadership with institutional goals and academic vision.
Central University statutes
follow a similar model where the
Chancellor, UGC, and university bodies
are key decision-makers, excluding executive government officials.
Academic and Non-Academic Professionals:
The broadened eligibility criteria open leadership positions to individuals from non-academic backgrounds, changing the traditional focus on academic excellence.
The draft regulations allow candidates with
experience in public policy or industry
, which some argue may dilute the focus on academic scholarship.

**********Income levels of salaried class have stagnated in recent years
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to employment;
Why in the News?
According to PLFS reports, employment in India is increasing, but the real wages of salaried workers have remained
unchanged since 2019.
What are the key reasons behind the stagnation of real wages for salaried workers in India since 2019?
Inflation Outpacing Wage Growth:
Rising consumer prices (CPI) have eroded the purchasing power of salaries despite nominal wage increases. For example, Real wages for salaried workers in India were
1.7% lower
in the June 2024 quarter compared to the June 2019 quarter (PLFS data).
Excess Labour Supply and Declining Returns to Education:
An oversupply of qualified workers has reduced the premium for higher education, limiting salary growth. For example, the share of self-employed workers increased from
53.5% in 2019-20 to 58.4% in 2023-24
, indicating a shift from salaried roles due to a lack of opportunities.
Depressed Private Sector Investment:
Reduced corporate investment leads to slower job creation and wage stagnation. For example, India’s
private sector investment-to-GDP ratio
declined from
28% in 2011-12 to 21.1% in 2022-23
(Reserve Bank of India).
Policy Shocks (Demonetisation and GST Impact):
Economic disruptions from demonetisation (2016) and GST (2017) weakened small and medium enterprises (SMEs), affecting formal employment. For example, Formal employment fell, and
salaried employment
as a share of total workers dropped from
22.9% in 2019-20 to 21.7% in 2023-24
Shift Toward Informal and Contractual Work:
Companies increasingly rely on temporary and gig workers, offering lower pay and fewer benefits. For example, Casual labour wages increased by
12.3%
(real terms) between
2019 and 2024
, while salaried wages stagnated, reflecting a rise in informal work.
Why is the increase in wages for casual labour not considered a net positive for the economy?
Lower Productivity Contribution:
Casual labour typically involves low-skilled, irregular work with limited productivity gains. While wages may rise, the overall economic output does not grow proportionately.
agriculture sector
, which employs a large share of casual labour, contributed only
16% to India’s GDP
in 2023-24 despite employing
over 45%
of the workforce (Economic Survey 2023-24).
Informal Nature of Work:
Casual jobs lack social security, health benefits, and job stability, leading to long-term economic insecurity despite wage increases.
In India,
93% of the workforce
remains in the
informal sector
with minimal social protection, contributing to economic vulnerability (ILO report, 2023).
Wage-Price Spiral Risk:
Rising wages in low-skilled sectors can increase the cost of goods and services, driving inflation without improving living standards.
For instance, wage increases for
casual farm labour
contribute to higher
food prices
, intensifying
retail inflation
(CPI rose by
7.44%
in July 2024, RBI).
Limited Skill Development and Upward Mobility:
Casual work offers fewer opportunities for training or career advancement, trapping workers in low-wage cycles despite nominal wage growth.
The
Periodic Labour Force Survey (2023-24)
shows that only
2.4%
of India’s workforce received
formal vocational training
, limiting skill-based upward mobility.
Depressed Consumption and Savings Rates:
Casual labourers typically earn subsistence-level wages, leaving little room for savings or significant consumption, which hampers long-term economic growth.
Household savings as a share of GDP declined from
23.6% in 2011-12
18.1% in 2022-23
, reflecting weak wage-driven consumption (RBI report).
When did real wages for self-employed workers begin to recover after the pandemic?
Real wages for self-employed workers in India began to recover after the pandemic in the quarters. Despite this recovery, as of the June 2024 quarter, real wages remained 1.5% lower than in the June 2019 quarter.
Rural vs. Urban Disparities:
Rural Areas:
In rural regions, self-employed workers experienced a 3.02% increase in real wages during the same period.
Urban Areas:
Conversely, urban self-employed workers saw a decline of 5.2% in real wages compared to pre-pandemic levels.
How have policy decisions like demonetization and the implementation of GST affected wage growth and employment patterns?
Disruption of Informal and Small-Scale Enterprises:
Both demonetisation and GST disrupted cash-dependent small and medium enterprises (SMEs), leading to job losses and reduced wage growth in the informal sector.
Example:
The share of salaried workers declined from
(PLFS data), indicating a shift away from formal employment.
Shift Toward Informal and Gig Work:
Policy shocks accelerated the transition from stable salaried jobs to informal, gig-based, and self-employed work, which generally offers lower pay and fewer benefits.
The share of self-employed workers increased from
, reflecting a rise in informal employment (PLFS data).
Slower Wage Growth and Employment Stagnation:
Compliance burdens from GST and cash shortages from demonetisation constrained business operations, leading to slower wage increases across sectors.
Real wages for salaried workers were
1.7% lower in June 2024
compared to June 2019 (PLFS data), indicating stagnant wage growth despite economic recovery.
Way forward:
Enhance Formal Employment and Skill Development:
Promote labour-intensive sectors and incentivize formal job creation through targeted tax benefits and reduced compliance burdens.
Strengthen Social Security and Wage Policies:
Implement comprehensive social protection schemes for informal workers to ensure income stability and healthcare benefits.
Mains PYQ:
Besides the welfare schemes, India needs deft management of inflation and unemployment to serve the poor and the underprivileged sections of the society. Discuss.
