**********Steps for Implementing Land Reforms in India
Why in News?
The Centre has decided to provide states with Rs 10,000 crore in incentives for implementing land-related reforms in rural and urban areas, and Rs 5,000 crore for creating a Farmers’ Registry during the financial year 2024-25 (FY25).
The funds will be provided under the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment 2024-25.

Significance of Actions on Reforms around Land
Challenges Towards Implementing Actions on Land Reforms
What is the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment 2024-25?
Promises Related to the Land Reforms Made in the Union Budget 2024-2025:
Land-related reforms in the rural areas:
These will include -
Assignment of unique land parcel identification numbers (ULPIN) or
Bhu-Aadhaar
for all lands,
Digitisation of cadastral maps,
Survey of map subdivisions as per current ownership,
Establishment of land registry, and
Linking to the farmers registry.
Land-related reforms on the urban front:
Digitisation of land records with GIS mapping.
Establishing an IT-based system for property record administration, updating, and tax administration.
These will facilitate
improving the financial position of urban local bodies
Implementation of the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in agriculture:
The Indian government (in partnership with States) will facilitate the implementation of the DPI in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their lands in 3 years.
This programme will include a “
digital survey
” of the kharif crop in 400 districts and the land details being brought into a “
”.
These actions will facilitate credit flow and other agricultural services to rural land.
Significance of Actions on Reforms around Land:
It points towards a
recognition that States are the key actors
on these issues, and that
approaches and constraints can vary across States
Overall better land registries and cadastral maps are key -
To understanding land-use around the country
To enforce building codes, and
To evaluate the risks due to various hazards, including
natural disasters.
Information about land-use and land-use change are also key to understanding India’s
emissions inventory.
Challenges Towards Implementing Actions on Land Reforms:
India has been trying to develop such land maps since the 1980s, with limited success.
One particular pitfall has been
lack of standards
These maps have been made by
manual digitisation
and are
not properly georeferenced
, i.e. the digital data is not mapped to fixed geographical coordinates.
The States have used
different mapping projections,
so maps prepared by one State’s processes are not directly compatible with those of another.
Thus, it is important to develop GIS data standards and interoperability for various end applications first.
These efforts also
need technology support and upgrading
, while appropriate and enabling institutional arrangements will need to be worked out at state and city levels.
In view of a
higher multiplier effect
of capital expenditure and in order to provide a boost to capital spending by States, the scheme was
announced in the Union Budget 2024-25.
The scheme (first launched in 2020-21)
provides financial assistance to state governments
in the form of 50-year interest-free loans for capital investment projects.
In 2024-25, the scheme was redesigned with an overall allocation of ₹1.30 lakh crore, and includes 2 mandatory conditions for the next fiscal year:
With many states tweaking the names of centrally sponsored schemes (CCSs), the Centre has made it mandatory that to avail of the capex loan,
states would have to retain the official name of all schemes.
The Centre has now mandated that states have to deposit the central share of interest earned in SNA accounts till March 31 (2024), in the Consolidated Fund of India.
The single nodal agencies (SNA) model
requires states to notify an SNA for each CSS to receive funds from both the Centre and from state budgets.

**********WHO declares monkeypox a public health emergency of global concern
Why in news?
The WHO has declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries being severely affected.
Since 2022, there have been 99,176 cases and 208 deaths reported from 116 countries. What seems to be worrisome is the spread of a new sexually transmissible strain of the virus.
What’s in today’s article?
WHO – About, WHO and India
What does declaration as a PHEIC mean?
Monkeypox
What is the reason for the current concern?
Risk for India
World Health Organisation
About:
Founded in 1948, it is the UN agency responsible for global public health. It has 194 member states.
It is based in
Geneva, Switzerland.
It is involved in vaccination campaigns, health emergencies and supporting countries in primary care.
It is funded by a combination of members' fees based on wealth and population and voluntary contributions.
India & WHO:
India became a party to the WHO in January 1948. India is a member state of the South East Asia Region at the WHO.
The first regional director for South East Asia was an Indian, Dr Chandra Mani, who served between 1948-1968.
Currently, the post has again been occupied by an Indian appointee, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, who has been in office since 2014.
Dr Soumya Swaminathan served as WHO’s chief scientist (2019-2022).
A PHEIC is declared for an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease.
PHEIC label by WHO is designed to
trigger a coordinated international response
and could unlock funding to collaborate on sharing vaccines and treatments.
Monkeypox:
It is a rare zoonotic viral disease belonging to the Orthopoxvirus genus in the Poxviridae family, the same virus family as smallpox.
Zoonotic diseases are those disease that spread from animals to humans.
It was first discovered in animals in 1958 when two outbreaks occurred in captive monkey colonies kept for research purposes. Hence, the name ‘monkeypox’.
Treatment
There is currently no specific treatment for monkeypox. However, the Vaccinia vaccine, which was used against smallpox, had shown 85% efficacy in monkeypox prevention.
The spread of
clade Ib of the mpox virus (MPXV)
, primarily transmitted through sexual contact, is causing concern.
Historically, clade I infections, which are deadlier than clade II, spread through zoonotic events, but sexual transmission of clade I was previously unreported.
Over 100 cases of clade Ib have emerged in countries neighboring the DRC—Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda—where mpox was not previously reported.
This, alongside a rise in total mpox cases to over 15,600 and 537 deaths this year, underscores the urgency of a coordinated international response.
WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros emphasized the need to control these outbreaks, as recent research shows the virus is now spreading human-to-human and rapidly mutating into new lineages.
The first case of the more contagious clade Ib mpox infection outside Africa was reported in Sweden,
raising concerns that it could spread to other countries through global travel
During the 2022 outbreak, India reported 27 cases and one death, primarily from the less deadly clade II, with infections initially linked to international travel but later spreading locally.
Experts emphasized that the current surge of mpox in Africa, coupled with the spread of a new sexually transmissible strain, is a global emergency.

**********Why climate change poses an existential threat to Panama Canal?   
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of Climate change on Panama Canal;
Why in the News?
The Panama Canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Isthmus of Panama, opened to ships 110 years ago. Now, it is facing a
serious threat to its existence.
System of Water Elevators
The Panama Canal utilizes a sophisticated
lock system that functions as water elevators, allowing ships to navigate the elevation difference between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
This system is essential because the two oceans are at different elevations, with the Pacific being slightly higher.
Operation of the Locks
Ship Enters:
A ship approaches the
first lock chamber, which is at sea level.
The gate opens to allow the ship into the chamber and then closes behind it.
Water Level Adjustment:
The valve between the first and second chamber (at a higher elevation) is opened, allowing water to flow into the
first chamber from the adjacent higher chamber.
This increases the water level in the first chamber.
Transition:
Once the
water levels between the two chambers are equalized,
the gate between them opens, allowing the ship to move into the next chamber. This process is repeated until the ship reaches the
desired elevation of 85 feet at Gatun Lake.
Lowering:
reverse process
occurs when
lowering ships back to sea level
at the other end of the canal.
Note:
Each passage requires over
50 million gallons (approximately 200 million liters) of freshwater,
primarily sourced from Lake Gatun, which is vital for the canal’s operation.
Threat of Climate Change
Recent droughts have led to significantly lower water levels in
because droughts were exacerbated by
climate change and the El Niño phenomenon,
which have led to
significantly reduced water levels in the lake
In 2023, rainfall was
43% lower than average
, making it one of the
driest years on record for the region.
which reduced the number of ships able to transit the canal.
In December,
traffic dropped to as low as 22 ships per day,
highlighting the vulnerability of the canal to climatic variations.
Contentious Solution
Proposed Dam:
$1.6 billion
project aims to create an
additional water source for the canal on the Rio Indio,
potentially
securing water availability for the next 50 years.
However, it has sparked controversy due to its
social implications.
Displacement Issues:
The dam would
flood the homes of approximately 2,000 residents
, predominantly from
lower socio-economic backgrounds
, forcing them to relocate and lose their livelihoods. This raises significant ethical concerns regarding the balance between infrastructure needs and the rights of affected communities
Conclusion:
Before proceeding with the Rio Indio dam project, engage in thorough consultations with the affected communities, ensuring their voices are heard in the decision-making process. Need to develop a
fair compensation and resettlement plan that prioritizes the socio-economic well-being
of displaced residents, offering alternative livelihoods and housing options to minimize the negative impact on vulnerable populations.
Do you know about another elevation-based canal system?
Kiel Canal (Germany):
The Kiel Canal features
locks that raise and lower vessels to navigate the elevation differences between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.
It is one of the busiest artificial waterways in the world.
Welland Canal (Canada): This canal connects
Lake Ontario and Lake Erie and includes a series of locks that lift ships approximately 43 meters (141 feet)
to bypass Niagara Falls. It is an essential part of the Great Lakes shipping route.
Trade from Panama Canal:
The Panama Canal moves roughly
$270 billion worth of cargo
annually, which is the trade route taken by
40% of all U.S. container traffic alone
. It handles about
5% of all global maritime trade.
Mains PYQ:
Mention the significance of straits and isthmus in international trade.
(UPSC IAS/2022)
**********How can traffic which causes air pollution be controlled?    
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related to air pollution in India;
Why in the News?
India has 83 of the world’s 100 most polluted cities. Air pollution caused 2.1 million deaths, with 99% breathing air below WHO standards.
Share of Road Transport in India’s CO2 Emissions as per
the International Energy Associates
Road transport is responsible for
approximately 12% of India’s total CO2 emissions.
Within this sector, heavy vehicles are a significant contributor to
particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions,
which are particularly harmful due to their
ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream.
Studies indicate that heavy vehicles contribute to about
60-70% of total vehicular PM emissions
40-50% of total Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions
in urban areas. This highlights the
critical role that road transport plays
in India’s overall air pollution problem.
Why has the vehicular scrapping policy not been effective in States like Karnataka and Maharashtra?
Insufficient Scrapping Facilities:
Both states have a
limited number of registered vehicle scrapping facilities (RVSFs).
For instance, Karnataka has only
two authorized RVSFs located in Devanahalli and Koratagere
, which are unable to handle the volume of vehicles eligible for scrapping.
Voluntary Compliance:
The policy’s reliance on voluntary participation has resulted in l
ow engagement from vehicle owners.
For example, the policy targets around
20 lakh vehicles for scrapping,
without mandatory compliance,
many older, polluting vehicles continue to operate on the roads
Lack of Awareness and Less Incentives:
There is a lack of awareness regarding the
benefits of scrapping old vehicles
among the public. Although the policy offers incentives, such as
tax relief for scrapping vehicles may not be sufficient to encourage
widespread participation.
Bureaucratic delays:
The implementation of the scrapping policy has
faced bureaucratic delays
and inconsistencies. In Maharashtra, despite announcing incentives for scrapping old vehicles, the actual impact has been
limited due to slow bureaucratic processes
and a lack of effective enforcement.
Steps taken:
Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE)
has taken several significant steps towards enhancing fuel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions in the transport sector through the implementation of the
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) norms.
Introduction of CAFE Norms:
The BEE has proposed the
CAFE III and CAFE IV norms,
which aim to set stringent targets for carbon emissions from passenger vehicles.
CAFE III,
effective from 2027 to 2032, sets a
target of 91.7 grams of CO2 per kilometer,
while
CAFE IV,
from 2032 to 2037,
aims for 70 grams of CO2 per kilometer.
These targets are designed to drive innovation and encourage the adoption of cleaner technologies in the automotive sector.
Transition to WLTP Testing:
A significant step is the commitment to transition from the Modified Indian Driving Cycle (MIDC) to the World Light Duty Vehicle Testing Procedure (WLTP) by March 31, 2027.
provides a more
accurate and globally harmonized measure of a vehicle’s fuel consumption
and emissions,
ensuring that the targets reflect real-world driving conditions
more effectively.
Penalties for Non-Compliance:
The BEE has outlined financial penalties for manufacturers that fail to meet the established fuel efficiency standards.
For instance, if a manufacturer’s average fuel efficiency
exceeds the limit by up to 0.2 liters per 100 km,
a penalty of
₹25,000 per vehicle applies.
If it exceeds by more than
0.2 liters,
the penalty increases to
₹50,000 per vehicle.
Way forward:
Enhance Infrastructure and Accessibility
: Need to increase the number of registered vehicle scrapping facilities (RVSFs) across states like Karnataka and Maharashtra to make the process more accessible.
Strengthen Policy Enforcement and Incentives
: Transition from voluntary to mandatory compliance for the scrapping of old and polluting vehicles. This can be supported by enhancing public awareness campaigns that highlight the environmental and financial benefits of vehicle scrapping.
Mains PYQ:
Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata are the three Megacities of the country but air pollution is a much more serious problem in Delhi as compared to the other two. Why is this so?
(UPSC IAS/2015)
**********Reshape the governance structures of AI companies      
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related to Data Access;
Why in the News?
Recently, corporations adopting stakeholder capitalism are focusing on products like Generative AI, which require governance models that balance profit-making with broader social responsibilities, reflecting a shift in corporate priorities.
Data Access Issues
Dependence on Data for AI Development:
The advancement of AI technologies necessitates access to vast amounts of data, including
personal and sensitive information.
This reliance raises
significant privacy concerns,
as improper handling of this data can lead to breaches of privacy rights.
Regulatory Scrutiny:
Companies like Meta have faced
regulatory challenges regarding data usage for AI training.
For example, Meta was asked to pause its
plans to train large language models using public content from Facebook and Instagram
due to
raised by regulators, highlighting the tension between data access and compliance with privacy laws.
Algorithmic Bias:
AI systems can
perpetuate existing biases
present in the data they are trained on,
leading to discriminatory outcomes.
For instance, Amazon
discontinued
a recruiting algorithm that
displayed gender bias.
Purpose vs. Strategy
Conflict Between Purpose and Profit:
Many companies, including OpenAI, initially adopted governance structures aimed at public benefit but faced challenges when
profit motives clashed with their social objectives.
The dismissal of
CEO Sam Altman
over concerns about prioritizing commercialization over user safety exemplifies this conflict.
Shareholder Primacy:
Despite the adoption of alternative governance models,
the underlying shareholder primacy often prevails.
The pressure to generate profits can
overshadow the intended social benefits
, leading to a situation where public good becomes secondary to financial gains.
Corporate Governance issue:
The governance issues faced by OpenAI, particularly the internal conflict that led to Altman’s firing,
raise questions about the effectiveness of public benefit corporate structures
in balancing profit and purpose, especially in tech companies reliant on investor capital.
Potential Shift to For-Profit Structures:
Rumors about OpenAI considering a
transition to a for-profit governance model
indicate a trend where companies may abandon their social objectives in favour of profit maximization.
Workable Strategy (Way forward)
Framing Ethical Standards:
Developing comprehensive
ethical guidelines for AI product companies is crucial.
These standards should address data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and accountability, ensuring that AI technologies are developed responsibly and equitably.
Incentivizing Public Benefit Objectives:
Corporations should be
incentivized to adopt public benefit purposes
that align with their business strategies. This could involve
financial incentives for companies that demonstrate long-term profit gains
from socially responsible practices.
Reducing Compliance Costs:
To encourage adherence to public benefit objectives, it is essential to lower the
compliance costs associated with implementing ethical practices.

**********Indian Astronomers discover new method for Solar Cycle Amplitude Prediction
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Space Weather, Solar Supergranular Cells
Why in the News?
Astronomers from the
Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA)
have developed a new
method to predict the amplitude of the upcoming solar cycle.
This discovery is based on
100 years of solar data
from the IIA’s
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory
What is Space Weather?
Space weather refers to the
varying conditions within the solar system
and its
heliosphere
influenced by the Sun and solar wind
The main components of space weather include:
coronal mass ejections
, and
solar flares.
These components can
compress the Earth’s magnetosphere
, triggering geomagnetic storms.
This can
disrupt
communication, power transmission, damage spacecraft electronics, and pose threats to astronauts.
Solar Cycle and Its Importance
The activity of the
Sun follows an approximately 11-year periodic cycle
, marked by variations in the number of sunspots on the Sun’s surface.
solar cycle influences space weather
, Earth’s atmosphere, and climate variations.
Predicting the amplitude of the solar cycle
is a major challenge in astrophysics, as it directly affects related phenomena and space weather.
Research Findings
IIA researchers discovered that the
width of supergranular cells
on the solar surface
during the
minimum year of the solar cycle
correlated with the number of sunspots
observed during the subsequent
solar cycle maximum
This simple method
can be used to predict the strength of the upcoming solar cycle
, which is valuable for space weather forecasting.
What are Supergranular Cells?
Supergranular Cells are
large convective cells on the Sun’s surface
, with
diameters
of about
30,000 km
These cells are
part of the solar convection zone
where
hot plasma rises
cools
as it reaches the surface, and
then sinks back down
continuous cycle
Characteristics:
Supergranular cells are larger than granules, another type of convective cell on the Sun. Its borders, known as
supergranular lanes
, are about
5,000 km thick
Plasma within these cells
moves from the center
of the cell
toward the edges
, where it sinks back into the Sun’s interior. This movement creates a
network of lanes
that can be observed on the solar surface.
associated with the magnetic field concentrations
on the Sun’s surface, often where sunspots and other magnetic features appear.
