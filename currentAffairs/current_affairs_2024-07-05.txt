Relevance of SCO for India
Criticism of SCO
About
SCO is a
permanent intergovernmental international organisation
, created in June 2001 in Shanghai (China).
Founding members included Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan.
The five countries had come together to work on regional security, reduction of border troops, and terrorism in the post-Soviet era in 1996.
In 2001, the Shanghai Five inducted Uzbekistan into the group and named it the SCO outlining its principles in a charter that
promoted what was called the Shanghai spirit of cooperation
This organization represents
approximately 42% of the world’s population, 22% of its land area and 20% of its GDP
Official working languages
: Chinese, Russian
SCO Secretariat
: Beijing, China
Members, Observers and dialogue partners
10 member states–
China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus.
India and Pakistan became full members at the Heads of State Council meet in Astana in 2017.
Iran became the 9
member of the SCO in 2023
under the chairmanship of India.
During this year’s summit (in 2024), Belarus become the 10
member of the organization.
2 Observer members –
Afghanistan, Mongolia
9 Dialogue Partners –
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Egypt, Cambodia, Qatar, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Sri Lanka.
In 2022, the procedure for granting the status of Dialogue Partners to Bahrain, Kuwait, Maldives, Myanmar and the United Arab Emirates was initiated at the SCO Summit in Samarkand
Organisational Structure of SCO
(HSC) is the supreme decision-making body in the SCO, it meets once a year.
Council of Heads of Government
is the second-highest council in the organisation.
Council of Foreign Ministers
hold regular meetings, where they discuss the current international situation.
Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS)
, based in Tashkent, is established to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism.
India’s association with SCO
India joined the SCO in 2005 as an observer country and became a
full member of the group at the Astana Summit in 2017
India created
five new pillars and focus areas of cooperation in SCO
--
Startups and Innovation, Traditional Medicine, Digital Inclusion, Youth Empowerment and Shared Buddhist Heritage
Two new mechanisms in SCO --
Special Working Group on Startups and Innovation and Experts Working Group on Traditional Medicine
-- were created at India's initiative.
Kashi/ Varanasi
was celebrated as the
1st SCO Tourist and Cultural Capital of SCO 2022-23
SCO is one of the few international organisations which deal with security issues and primarily has Asian members.
Regional heavyweights Russia and China have stressed its position as an alternative to a Western international order.
Along with the BRICS grouping, which has India, South Africa and Brazil as well, the two countries are seen positioning against US influence.
SCO's recent expansion is influenced by deteriorating US relations with Russia and China, highlighted by the 2022 Russia-Ukraine War and US-China trade tensions.
Iran's inclusion in the SCO in 2023 was seen as a move to enhance the organization's influence and counter US diplomatic efforts.
SCO membership allows India to
cooperate more with Central Asian countries and address common security issues
, despite historically weak relations since 1991.
The Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) is a key SCO component, aiding in counter-terrorism exercises, intelligence analysis, and sharing information on terrorist movements and drug trafficking.
However, the effectiveness of the SCO is questioned due to tensions among its members. India currently has strained relations with China and Pakistan.
Last year, India opted for a virtual SCO summit during its presidency and refused to support a paragraph endorsing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the New Delhi Declaration.
India's opposition stems from the BRI's China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) passing through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which India views as a violation of its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
Competition between Russia and China
Despite declarations of "limitless friendship" between China and Russia, there is competition between them for influence, especially in Central Asia.
Traditionally considered part of Russia's sphere, Central Asian nations have also seen significant Chinese investment through the Belt and Road Initiative.
The inclusion of India and Pakistan in the SCO in 2017 reflects this rivalry, with Russia supporting India and China backing Pakistan to maintain a balance of power.
Chinese hegemony
SCO as a platform is seen by the West as an organization to forward Chinese interests.
Rivalries between members
According to experts, the SCO may not yield significant outcomes due to its vague initiatives, allowing countries to overlook their rivalries without resolving them.
For instance, India and Pakistan, as well as India and China, have tense relationships.
The SCO's broad language enables countries to nominally support initiatives while prioritizing their own interests when conflicts arise.

**********Rule regarding the declassification of private papers of public figures
Why in news?
The Prime Ministers’ Museum & Library (PMML) will no longer allow future donors of Private Papers of eminent personalities to impose indefinite conditions on their declassification.
In 2008, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi reclaimed and restricted access to several boxes of papers from Jawaharlal Nehru’s Private Collection that had been previously donated to the museum.
What’s in today’s article?
Private Papers of public figures
Organisation other than the PMML that acquires Private Papers
Declassification of private papers
The Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) has been renamed as the Prime Ministers’ Museum & Library (PMML).
NMML was established in the memory of Jawaharlal Nehru (1889-1964).
It is an
autonomous institution
under the Ministry of Culture
, Government of India.
It is located in the majestic Teen Murti House, the official residence of the first Prime Minister of India.
It has four major constituents, namely, a
, a l
ibrary on modern India
Centre for Contemporary Studies
and the
Nehru Planetarium
Private papers of public figures
About
Private papers of public figures are personal documents, correspondence, diaries, manuscripts, and other records belonging to notable individuals, often including politicians, leaders, and influential personalities.
These papers provide insights into their personal lives, thoughts, and interactions, and are valuable for historical research and understanding the context of their public roles and contributions.
The individual collections have come from families, institutions, universities, and other private donors.
The papers are invaluable for an accurate appraisal of the lives and times of these personalities, and essential for an understanding of India’s modern history and its landmark moments.
Private Papers vs Personal Papers
There are essential differences between papers and correspondence that can be deemed personal, as opposed to Private Collections, even if they pertain to the same person.
For instance, the correspondence of a President or a Prime Minister with other eminent personalities of the time, or with institutions, can be part of that person’s Private Collection.
This is by virtue of these papers being owned by the person’s family or other private individuals.
However, correspondence and documents held in personal capacity can become part of personal papers.
Official Records
Official Records constitute another set of papers — these are held by various government departments and ministries.
It could comprise letters, records, or file notings, etc. pertaining to the working of various central and state governments.
The other organisation that acquires Private Collections in the country, the National Archives of India.
This organization also works under the Ministry of Culture.
This organization acquires only those papers which the donors agree to declassify.
It is the norm to put all records in the public domain, unless in very rare cases, where the concerns may be pressing and pertain to security or sensitivity.
Conditions imposed by the donors
When donors give their private collections to archives and museums, they sometimes make agreements with the institution.
These agreements can include conditions on when and how the collections can be made public.
New Declassification Rules by Ministry of Culture
Many donors who gave their private collections to PMML did not specify when these papers could be made public.
As a result, PMML keeps and conserves the papers, but cannot make them available to the public or researchers.
Because of this, the museum, which is part of the Ministry of Culture, has decided on a new rule.
Normally,
they will allow only a five-year embargo
from the date they receive any new papers.
In rare cases,
this embargo can be extended to a maximum of ten years
Laws governing declassification in India
Public Records Rules, 1997
, covers declassification of all kinds of records and correspondence in India.
For official records, the Rules say that the responsibility for declassification rests with the respective organisations, and that records should ordinarily be declassified in 25 years.
Public Records include any records related to the central government and its ministries, departments, or offices, such as the PMO and the President’s Office.
However, the 1997 Rules do not give extensive powers over papers owned by private individuals and families.
Access to these private papers is voluntary and can happen through donation or sale of the documents.

**********Replacing the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) with a Producer Price Index (PPI)
Why in News?
The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is close to finalising a model to launch a Producer Price Index (PPI) in India that may eventually replace the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
The government has been trying to determine the methodology for constructing a PPI in the Indian context for over two decades, the biggest challenge being finalising one that would make an improvement to the existing WPI.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)?
What is the Producer Price Index (PPI)?
Challenges in Shifting from WPI to PPI
Definition:
WPI represents the
price of goods at a wholesale stage
e. goods that are sold in bulk and traded between organisations instead of consumers, and is used as a measure of inflation in some economies.
How is it calculated?
WPIs are
reported monthly
in order to show the average price changes of goods.
The total costs of the goods being considered in one year are then compared with the total costs of goods in the
base year
The total prices for the base year are equal to 100 on the scale. Prices from another year are compared to that total and expressed as a percentage of change.
WPI in India:
It is used as an important measure of inflation in India and takes into account the change in price of
goods only.
WPI data is published by the
Office of Economic Adviser
, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India.
The current series of WPI - with
base year of 2011-12
- was the seventh revision of WPI and implemented from 2017 onwards.
Major components of WPI:
Primary articles,
which is subdivided into Food Articles and Non-Food Articles (Oil Seeds, Minerals and Crude Petroleum).
Fuel & Power,
which tracks price movements in Petrol, Diesel and LPG.
Manufactured goods
comprise the biggest basket (Textiles, Apparels, Chemicals, Cement, Metals, Sugar and Tobacco Products, Vegetable and Animal Oils, etc)
WPI Food Index:
It is a sub-index within WPI, and includes Food Articles from the Primary Articles basket and the food products from the Manufactured Products basket.
Significance of WPI:
It is an easy and convenient method to calculate inflation and Fiscal and monetary policy changes are greatly influenced by changes in WPI.
Criticism of WPI:
It does not account for inflation at the level of the ordinary public because they do not buy products at wholesale prices.
excludes the service sector,
which covers about 55% of GDP.
WPI has an inbuilt bias due to
double counting
of the same product and
doesn’t include exports and imports.
PPI measures wholesale prices
from the point of view of producers of goods and services by tracking prices at different stages of production.
It looks at inflation
from the viewpoint of industry and business and measures price changes before consumers purchase final goods and services.
It has replaced WPI in most countries as it is conceptually
in line with the internationally agreed System of National Accounts (SNA)
to compile measures of economic activity.
Challenges in Shifting from WPI to PPI:
Likely to take more time:
This is because the government would have to address the issues of -
Preparing the right samples,
Assigning the weighting, and
Deciding on the periodicity (whether monthly or weekly) of the price collection.
The biggest issue - To identify which services to include:
What sort of services will serve as the correct representative of the sector?
WPI is still the most widely followed measure of inflation:
It is used as one of the deflators along with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate real GDP from nominal GDP.
The government is separately working towards changing the current base year of 2011-12 for WPI.

Why did the colonists want Independence from Britain?
Lack of Representation:
Colonists were discontented with British policies that imposed taxes and laws without colonial representation in the British Parliament, which they viewed as unjust and oppressive.
Policy Shifts:
After the French and Indian War, Britain ended its policy of salutary neglect and imposed stricter controls on the colonies, including prohibitions on westward expansion and new taxes through acts like the Stamp Act and Tea Act.
Ideas of Freedom:
Influenced by Enlightenment ideals of liberty and equality, colonists began to articulate grievances against monarchical rule and asserted their natural rights to self-governance.
Resistance Movements
: Events like the Boston Tea Party symbolized widespread resistance to British taxation and policies, galvanizing colonial unity and determination for independence.
Armed Conflict:
The escalation from protests and boycotts to armed conflict (beginning in 1775) underscored the colonies’ resolve to break away from British control and establish their own governance.
What happened in the lead up to American independence?
Formation of Continental Congress:
Colonists formed the Continental Congress to coordinate resistance efforts and explore avenues for negotiation with Britain, which ultimately failed due to British refusal to grant representation.
Boycotts and Protests:
Colonists attempted economic boycotts of British goods and engaged in protests against oppressive British policies, marking a period of growing dissent and opposition.
Outbreak of War:
By 1775, clashes between colonial militias and British troops erupted into open warfare, solidifying the shift from grievances to armed struggle for independence.
Declaration of Independence:
The Continental Congress formally declared the colonies’ independence on July 2, 1776, followed by the adoption and signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.
Continental Army and Allies:

**********Indian Government Bonds in JP Morgan index: how much funds could flow into India?   
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Mains level:
Benefits of Higher Inflows from the Inclusion of Indian Government Bonds in JP Morgan’s Emerging Markets Bond Indices
Why in the news?
JP Morgan is including Indian Government Bonds in its emerging markets bond indices starting June 28. This move is expected to attract significant foreign investment, boosting India’s bond market and economic stability.
What would be India’s weight in the index?
India is poised to achieve a maximum weighting of 10% in the GBI-EM Global Diversified Index. This increased allocation is anticipated to attract greater investment from global investors into Indian debt, with analysts projecting monthly inflows of $2-3 billion.
Increase in Foreign Exchange Reserves:
The inflows from foreign investments will directly boost India’s foreign exchange reserves, providing a stronger buffer against external economic shocks.
Strengthening the Rupee:
The surge in foreign investment will enhance demand for the rupee, leading to its appreciation and contributing to a more stable and robust currency.
Enhanced External Financial Management:
With increased foreign exchange reserves, India will have greater flexibility and resilience in managing its external financial obligations and mitigating balance of payment issues.
Reduction in Borrowing Costs:
Higher reserves and a stronger rupee can lead to improved credit ratings and reduced risk premiums, lowering borrowing costs for the government and corporates.
Promotion of Economic Confidence:
The inflows signify international investor confidence in India’s economic prospects, boosting overall economic sentiment and encouraging further investments.
What about the impact on inflation as RBI mops up the dollars and releases an equivalent amount in rupees?
Liquidity Injection:
When the RBI mops up dollars from the market, it releases an equivalent amount of rupees into the financial system. This injection of liquidity can potentially increase the supply of money circulating in the economy.
Demand-Pull Inflation:
Increased liquidity can stimulate demand for goods and services, potentially leading to demand-pull inflation if the production capacity of the economy does not keep pace with the increased demand.
Asset Price Inflation:
The influx of liquidity can also inflate asset prices such as real estate and stocks, impacting affordability and potentially creating asset price inflation.
Exchange Rate Stability:
On the flip side, mopping up dollars can help stabilize the exchange rate by reducing downward pressure on the rupee due to excessive inflows.
RBI’s Policy Response:
The RBI has various monetary policy tools, such as open market operations, repo rates, and reserve requirements, to manage liquidity and inflationary pressures arising from such inflows. It may use these tools to absorb excess liquidity and stabilize inflation.
Way forward:
Prudent Monetary Policy Management:
The RBI should continue to employ effective monetary policy measures, such as open market operations and repo rate adjustments, to carefully manage liquidity and inflationary pressures stemming from increased foreign inflows.
Enhanced Economic Diversification:
India should use the influx of foreign investment to diversify its economy further, focusing on infrastructure development, technological advancements, and sustainable growth initiatives to bolster long-term economic resilience and stability.

This would provide a platform to showcase its climate leadership and set ambitious global climate agendas. Successful hosting, akin to its G-20 Presidency, would strengthen India’s influence in global climate policy.
Advocacy and Consensus Building:
India should start early to build consensus on critical climate issues, such as ending new investments in oil and gas post-2030 and securing significant commitments for adaptation finance. Proactively engaging in dialogues, forming alliances, and addressing concerns of other nations will help India lead negotiations and drive meaningful outcomes.
Promoting Equity and Climate Finance:
India should continue to emphasize equity in climate action and finance in international forums. Advocating for fair treatment of developing countries and pushing for enhanced climate finance mechanisms will strengthen India’s position as a leader of the Global South.
Collaboration on Long-Term Climate Strategies:
Federal entities can work with state governments to develop and implement long-term climate and energy models. Examples include supporting states like Tamil Nadu and Bihar in crafting their net-zero plans.
Enhanced Coordination and Policy Alignment:
Forming a Centre-State coordination group can ensure better synchronization of climate actions across states. This group can facilitate regular communication and policy alignment while respecting the autonomy of each state.
Financial Incentives through the Sixteenth Finance Commission:
Federal entities can use financial mechanisms like the Finance Commission to incentivize states for their climate initiatives. This can include grants or additional funding for states that demonstrate significant progress in climate action.
Integration of Scientific Capabilities in Policymaking:
Encouraging states to incorporate scientific modelling and data analysis into their climate policies. Federal support can enhance the technical capabilities of states, ensuring data-driven and effective climate strategies.
Consistent and Accurate Climate Data Management:
Developing a unified MRV architecture at the state level to standardize data collection and reporting. This system can help track progress, ensure accountability, and facilitate better policy adjustments based on reliable data.
The Indian government has taken several initiatives to address climate change, but their effectiveness is still being evaluated:
National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC):
Launched in 2008, the NAPCC identified eight national missions to promote understanding of climate change, adaptation and mitigation, energy efficiency, and natural resource conservation. While these missions have led to some progress, such as the ambitious targets set under the National Solar Mission, their overall impact is still being assessed.
State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs):
Under the NAPCC, states are required to develop their own action plans. As of 2022, 33 states and union territories have prepared their SAPCCs. However, the implementation and monitoring of these plans remain a challenge.
Climate change research and knowledge networks:
The government has supported various research initiatives and knowledge networks to enhance understanding of climate change impacts and responses. These include the National Network Programmes on Climate Change Modelling, Aerosols, and Coastal Vulnerability. While these networks have generated valuable knowledge, their ability to inform policy and action is still being evaluated
Conclusion:
India should expand its climate targets beyond the power sector to include other key areas such as transportation, industry, and agriculture. Clear and ambitious targets for zero-carbon two- and four-wheelers, as well as other sectors, will drive comprehensive decarbonization efforts.
Mains PYQ:
Explain the purpose of the Green Grid Initiative launched at World Leaders Summit of the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021. When was this idea first floated in the International Solar Alliance (ISA)?

Why in the News?
The
Karnataka government
has formed an
expert committee
, headed by Niranjan, Chief Environment Officer of Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, to
study the pollution level in the Cauvery
.
About Niranjan Panel
The panel will review and submit a report within 10 days to ascertain whether the Cauvery River water is polluted due to the inflow of sewage water, solid waste, industrial waste, and other types of pollutants.
The Cauvery water has lost its natural quality due to the pollutants and the health of citizens and aquatic animals are being adversely affected.
About Cauvery River
The Cauvery River, also spelled as ‘
Kaveri’
and known as ‘
Ponni’
in Tamil,
originates from Talakaveri in the Brahmagiri range
located in Karnataka’s Kodagu district.
It spans approximately
800 km
, traversing through the states of
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
, until it eventually reaches the Bay of Bengal.
The river’s catchment area covers regions in
Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and the Union Territory of Pondicherry.
Key tributaries
that join the Cauvery include
Harangi, Hemavati, Kabini, Suvarnavathi,
Bhavani
It remains
perennial
due to its dual reliance on both advancing and retreating monsoons for rainfall.
Protected areas in its basin:
Cauvery WLS,  Biligirirangan Hills WLS,  Pushpagiri WLS,  Muthathi WLS,  Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary,  Bhimeshwari WLS, Nagarhole NP; Bandipur NP.
Challenges associated with the Cauvery River:
Direct discharge of untreated sewage
and domestic waste from towns and cities along the Cauvery contaminates the water, leading to high bacterial loads and nutrient pollution.
Industries
along the Cauvery, including textiles, dyeing, pharmaceuticals, and others, discharge effluents directly into the river.
Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers
used in agricultural fields adjacent to the river are washed into the Cauvery during rain and irrigation.
Unregulated sand mining
and dredging
activities disrupt riverbeds and banks, altering natural flow patterns and habitat structures.
Introduction of non-native species
like tilapia and African catfish, initially for aquaculture, has led to their proliferation in the Cauvery.
