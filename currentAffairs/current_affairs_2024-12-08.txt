**********Who are Nicobarese?
New genetic research on Nicobarese revealed a significant ancestral connection with Austro-Asiatic populations across South and Southeast Asia.
About Nicobarese:
"Nicobarese" is a general term used by outsiders to refer to an
indigenous community that inhabits much of the Nicobar Islands.
The Nicobar Islands are part of the larger Andaman and Nicobar archipelago located some 1,200 km off the east coast of India in the Bay of Bengal.
constitute a land mass of 1,841 sq. km, which is about a
fourth of the total area of the entire Andaman and Nicobar archipelago.
Of the twenty-four islands in the Nicobars, twelve are inhabited.
The Nicobarese belong to the
Southeast Asian cultural complex
speak an Austro-Asiatic language.
However, they are far from being a homogenous group. The internal diversity among them takes the form of
four distinct cultural groups
. These are the islands of:
Car Nicobar;
Chowra (Chaura), Bompoka (Bompooka) and Teressa;
Katchal (Katchall), Nancowry, Kamorta (Camorta) and Trinket;
Little Nicobar, Kondul, Pulo Milo (Pilomillow), and Great Nicobar.
According to the 2011 census, the indigenous Nicobarese number is 23,681. The population is unevenly distributed, with nearly half living in Car Nicobar.
Largely self-sufficient, the Nicobarese practice a
mix of hunting and gathering, fishing and raising pigs.

**********What are Sacred Groves?
Sacred groves can harbour and support biodiversity and also act as carbon sinks; but most of them are under threat today.
About Sacred Groves:
Sacred Groves are
patches of natural or near-natural vegetation
,
dedicated by local
communities to their ancestral spirits or deities.
These groves are
protected by local communities,
usually
through customary taboos and sanctions
with ancestral and ecological implications.
India has well over
13,000 documented sacred groves
. The states particularly rich in abundance of groves are
Kerala, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Meghalaya
Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu.
These are known as
Kavu/Sarpa Kavu in Kerala,
Devarakadu
Devkad in Karnataka, Deorai/Devrai in Maharashtra, Jahera/Thakuramma in Odisha, e
The degree of sanctity of the sacred forests varies from one grove to another. For example, the Garo and the Khasi tribes of northeastern India completely prohibit any human interference in the sacred groves.
The sacred groves are important repositories of floral and faunal diversity that have been conserved by local communities in a sustainable manner.
They are often the last refuge of endemic species in the geographical region.

**********New research sheds light on genetic heritage of the Nicobarese
Why in news?
A new study reveals that the Nicobarese are genetically close to South and Southeast Asians, particularly the Austroasiatic language-speaking Htin Mal communities in Thailand and Laos.
This is the first detailed genetic analysis of the tribe, involving 1,559 samples, published in the European Journal of Human Genetics.
What’s in today’s article?
Tribals in A & N Islands
Htin Mal community
Key highlights of the study
Nicobarese tribe
Tribes
The tribe-wise population of Scheduled Tribes in Andaman and Nicobar Islands as per Census 2011 is given below:
Various steps for welfare
Communication and Trust-Building with Tribal Communities
The Andaman & Nicobar (A&N) Administration has established communication channels with the Jarawas to understand their concerns and future needs.
This initiative has enhanced the Jarawas' confidence, leading to improved information sharing about poaching, encroachment, and abuse.
Protection of Sentinelese Tribes
The A&N Administration follows an
'eyes-on and hands-off'
policy for the Sentinelese tribes.
A circumnavigation protocol around North Sentinel Island, developed in consultation with the Government of India, has helped prevent poaching and maintain the tribe's isolation.
About
They reside in mainland Southeast Asia & are recognized for their distinct ethnic identity and genetic affinity with the Nicobarese people, an indigenous group from the Nicobar Islands.
Linguistic Affiliation
The Htin Mal speak an
, specifically belonging to the Khmuic branch, which further strengthens their connection to the Nicobarese.
Ethnic Distinctiveness:
Although genetically similar to the Nicobarese, the Htin Mal have maintained a distinct ethnic identity, showing noticeable genetic drift from the Nicobarese population.
Significance
The Htin Mal are of particular interest to anthropologists and geneticists, as studies have linked them to the genetic ancestry of other groups, such as the Nicobarese tribe.
This highlights their role in understanding the ancient migrations and cultural exchanges in Southeast Asia.
About the study
New genetic research on Nicobarese population was conducted by scientists from CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and others.
The research was conducted using DNA markers inherited exclusively from mothers and fathers respectively, and those from both the parents from among the Nicobarese people.
This is to explore their ancestry and genetic affinities with the South and Southeast Asian populations.
Key findings
The 25,000-strong Nicobarese population appears to have a significant ancestral connection with Austroasiatic populations across South and Southeast Asia.
They could have settled in the region only about 5,000 years ago.
The study highlighted the common genetic affinity of the ‘Htin Mal’, a population in the mainland of Southeast Asia, with the Nicobarese.
Location and Overview
The Nicobarese tribe inhabits the Nicobar Islands in the eastern Indian Ocean, comprising seven large islands, including Car Nicobar and Great Nicobar, along with smaller islands like Little Nicobar and Nancowry.
Historical Migration and Evolutionary Insights
The tribe migrated to the Nicobar Islands 4,500–5,000 years ago, with both men and women relocating.
Previous theories suggested that the linguistic ancestors of the Nicobarese settled in the Nicobar archipelago during the early Holocene, about 11,700 years ago.
Unlike many early human communities, the Nicobarese evolved differently, linking their livelihood to agricultural practices prevalent in Southeast Asia during that era.
The abundance of food from farming enabled population growth and expansion into new territories, including the Nicobar Islands.
Preservation of Genomic Origins
The Nicobarese have preserved their genetic lineage, language, and ethnic identity due to isolation from mainland populations.
Stable DNA markers, which remain unchanged for thousands of years, enabled researchers to trace their genomic past.
Current Lifestyle and Habitat
The Nicobarese, numbering approximately 25,000, thrive in forested areas, living sustainably through rearing pigs, goats, and hens, along with utilizing forest produce like coconut palm.
Need for Protection
Researchers emphasize the importance of protecting the Nicobarese community to limit their exposure to pathogens common among mainland populations.
Their isolation has helped preserve their distinct genomic and cultural identity.

**********The new phase of war in Syria
Why in news?
Syria's prolonged civil war has gained renewed global attention following a significant rebel offensive. Insurgents have seized Aleppo, the country's largest city, along with numerous nearby towns and villages. The offensive marks the most intense clashes since a 2020 ceasefire.
Rebels have now secured full control of Daraa province, their third major conquest after Aleppo and Hama, with plans to target Homs and Sweida.
What’s in today’s article?
Syrian civil war
Key players in Syria’s long-running civil war
New phase of war in Syria
Origin
The Syrian civil war began around the
"Arab Spring" of 2010
, which saw uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa against long-standing authoritarian governments.
While some countries, like Tunisia and Egypt, experienced regime change, most movements were suppressed by governments and militaries.
Social media platforms, especially Twitter, played a role in spreading pro-democracy ideas.
Foreign powers, including the US and Russia, responded based on their strategic interests.
Conflict in Syria
In Syria, protests emerged against President Assad, who has been in power since 2000.
While Assad's regime now controls most of the country, some regions remain outside his grasp, including Kurdish-majority areas in the east, parts of the south, and regions controlled by Islamic State offshoots.
The 2020 Ceasefire in Idlib
A ceasefire deal brokered by Turkey and Russia in March 2020 brought relative calm to Idlib province.
Turkey backs Syrian rebels, while Russia supports the Assad regime. Since the ceasefire,
HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham)
, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, has maintained de facto control of Idlib.
HTS, designated a terrorist group by the US, Russia, and Turkey, has a complex relationship with Turkey.
Turkey acts as Idlib’s protector, shielding it from large-scale attacks by Assad's forces and their Russian allies.
Simultaneously, Turkey controls the border, facilitating trade and taxation critical to HTS’s operations.
Syrian Government
Led by President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian government has been central to the civil war since 2011.
With support from Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah, Assad has regained much of the lost territory.
Initially formed as the Al Nusra Front with ties to the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham emerged as a major jihadist faction by 2016.
United States
The U.S. initially supported opposition groups but shifted focus to fighting the Islamic State from 2014.
It provides airstrikes and support to Kurdish forces, maintaining about 900 troops in Syria.
Turkey has conducted military interventions mainly against Kurdish-led forces and now controls parts of Syria's northern border.
A key ally of Assad, Russia has supported the regime with troops, airstrikes, and a military presence at air and naval bases in Syria.
Iran and Hezbollah
Syria is part of Iran's "axis of resistance," with Hezbollah playing a central role in opposing Israel and reducing U.S. influence in the region.
Israel targets Hezbollah and Iranian positions in Syria, focusing on military personnel, weapons facilities, and transport routes for arms.
Kurdish Forces
The U.S.'s main partner in the fight against the Islamic State, Kurdish forces also face conflicts with Turkey, which views them as linked to a separatist insurgency.
Surprise attack
On November 27, Syria’s “Military Opposition Command” launched an offensive against President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, capturing Aleppo after battles in Idlib, Aleppo, and Hama.
In response, Assad’s allies, Iran and Russia, pledged support, with Syrian and Russian jets striking rebel-held areas in northwestern Syria.
Significance of the Current Syrian Offensive
Strongest Rebel Effort in Years
The latest offensive by Syrian rebels represents their most significant action in recent years.
However, Assad’s regime has experience quelling similar rebellions, as seen in Aleppo in 2016 with Russian air support, a strategy being repeated now.
Regime Vulnerability
The attack underscores Assad’s vulnerabilities, with key allies like Iran and Hezbollah preoccupied elsewhere.
Israel, supported by the US, has been actively combating Hezbollah in Lebanon due to its support for Hamas.
Meanwhile, Russia remains embroiled in its war with Ukraine since 2022.
Persistent Regional Instability
Despite a provisional ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon on November 27, violations were reported.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted two airstrikes on Hezbollah assets in southern Lebanon, suggesting peace in the region remains uncertain in the short term.

One of the chosen sites was the biodiversity-rich
Melur region in Madurai, Tamil Nadu
The auction was part of Tranche IV under the
Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957
, focusing on strategic minerals like tungsten, phosphorite, and vanadium essential for high-tech and green energy applications.
Significance of the Mining Site:
The 2,015.51-hectare Nayakkarpatti tungsten block is known for its deposits of
, a primary tungsten ore.
The Periyar canal has been identified as the water source for mining operations.
Despite its resource potential, the site overlaps with biodiversity heritage areas in Arittapatti and Meenakshipuram villages, which were designated to protect ecological and cultural assets.
Opposition to the Project:
Environmental Concerns:
The biodiversity heritage site, notified by Tamil Nadu in 2022, spans 193.63 hectares across Arittapatti and Meenakshipuram villages.
Environmentalists argue that mining could harm flora, fauna, and cultural landmarks, including ancient temples and Jain relics.
Tailings from ore processing may release harmful metals like arsenic, cadmium, and lead, posing risks to human health and the environment.
Activist and Public Outcry:
Environmental groups highlighted the potential ecological damage.
Activists criticized Vedanta's environmental record, citing pollution from its copper smelting unit in Thoothukudi.
Cultural Significance:
The region is rich in heritage, and locals fear mining could distort its cultural identity.
Government’s Position:
State Government's Position:
Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister M.K. Stalin urged the Union government to cancel the mining rights, vowing to pass a resolution in the State Assembly to reject the project.
The State government claims it informed the Centre about the biodiversity heritage site's existence during land discussions.
Union Government’s Response:
The Union Ministry of Mines contends there was no opposition from the Tamil Nadu government during the auction process, which began in February 2024.
Conclusion:
The tungsten mining project in Madurai underscores the complex balance between resource exploitation and environmental preservation.
While the Union government highlights strategic benefits, the Tamil Nadu government and environmental groups emphasize protecting biodiversity and cultural heritage.
The outcome of this controversy could set a precedent for how India navigates similar resource management disputes in the future.

**********SEBI Tightens Grip on SME IPO Market Amid Growing Concerns Over Misconduct
Why in News?
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has cancelled the SME IPO of Trafiksol ITS Technologies and mandated refunds to investors, citing alleged misuse of funds through a shell entity. This action comes as SEBI plans to tighten SME IPO norms amidst booming investor interest and rising concerns over market misconduct.

Features of SME IPOs
The Growing SME IPO Market
Rising Concerns in the SME IPO Market
SEBI’s Proposed Regulatory Measures
Conclusion
These are businesses that have their assets, revenues, assets, or number of employees lower than a specific cut-off level.
In India,
SMEs are significant contributors to the economy
and can be in any segment, such as manufacturing or services.
The biggest challenge an SME faces is access to capital
. To solve this problem, they often use an SME IPO to raise capital from the stock market.
SME IPOs are
initial public offerings (IPOs) issued by SMEs
While a normal or mainboard IPO requires the company to follow certain guidelines in terms of the size of the company,
those guidelines are more relaxed in the case of SME IPOs
This allows even smaller companies to access capital
directly from the public in the stock market.
Once the IPO allotment gets over, the SME stock gets listed and starts being traded in the stock exchange, but on a separate platform dedicated to SMEs.
SME IPO is an extremely popular way for a company to gather funds from various investors and be listed.
Features of SME IPOs:
An SME has to announce an IPO at an SME platform during an exchange before the stocks can get listed and traded or exchanged.
The post-issue paid-up capital of the SME should not exceed ₹25 crore
Eligibility requirements for SME IPO company directors, promoters, investors, etc., remain the same as for a regular IPO.
This means that the said persons
should not be defaulters, offenders or disqualified from accessing the capital markets.
The SME platforms of National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) are
NSE Emerge and BSE SME
, respectively.
The Growing SME IPO Market:
SME platforms overview:
NSE SME Exchange: 417 companies (Market cap: Rs. 1.31 lakh crore).
BSE SME Exchange: 328 companies (Market cap: Rs. 68,500 crore).
Total SME market capitalisation: ~Rs. 2 lakh crores.
Market trends:
The SME IPO market is thriving, with multiple issues being oversubscribed and listed at significant premiums.
29 out of 61 IPOs since September 2024 saw oversubscriptions of over 100 times.
Record-breaking fundraising:
FY 2023-24:
196 IPOs raised over Rs. 6,000 crores.
FY 2024-25 (till October 15):
159 IPOs raised Rs. 5,700 crores.
Key drivers of the SME IPO boom:
High market liquidity:
Investors seeking quick returns have amplified trading activity in less liquid SME stocks.
Retail participation surge:
Retail investors' fear of missing out (FOMO) has increased subscription rates dramatically.
Promising returns:
Substantial gains post-listing have driven further interest in the SME segment.
Rising Concerns in the SME IPO Market:
Misuse of funds and fraudulent practices:
Diversion of IPO proceeds:
SEBI identified instances of fund diversion to shell companies and related parties.
Trafiksol's Rs. 17.70 crore contract was linked to a questionable vendor lacking credible financial records.
Circular transactions:
Companies inflated revenues through transactions with related entities to mislead investors.
Governance and transparency issues
Promoter-driven structure:
SME entities often have concentrated shareholding, with limited oversight from institutional investors.
High-risk related party transactions (RPTs):
Half of SME listed entities engaged in RPTs exceeding Rs. 10 crores; one-fifth had RPTs exceeding Rs. 50 crores.
SEBI’s Proposed Regulatory Measures:
Revised IPO framework:
Minimum application value to double to Rs. 2 lakhs.
Increase the minimum number of allottees for IPO success from 50 to 200.
Restrict Offer for Sale (OFS) limit to 20% of the issue size.
Enhanced monitoring:
Mandating monitoring agencies to oversee IPO fund utilization. Lock-in on minimum promoter contribution (MPC) extended to five years.
Scrutiny of RPTs:
Greater regulatory focus on RPTs to prevent fund diversion.
Conclusion:
While SME IPOs present lucrative opportunities for investors, SEBI’s interventions highlight the
importance of transparency and accountability.
The proposed regulatory changes aim to safeguard investor interests, curb malpractices, and ensure sustainable growth in the SME segment.
