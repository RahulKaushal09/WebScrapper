Why in the News?
Days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s expected visit to the U.S., the Donald Trump administration has started the process of deporting illegal Indian immigrants.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context, Mass Deportations, Immigration Policy Changes, etc.)
India’s Response (Trump’s Economic Leverage, Impact on the Indian Community, etc.)
Background:
The
US has intensified its immigration crackdown
, with
military planes deporting undocumented Indian migrants
under President
Donald Trump’s administration
With an estimated
7,25,000 undocumented Indians
in the US, the move impacts thousands of Indian nationals.
India has
agreed to take back illegal migrants
after verifying their citizenship, aiming to protect legal migration pathways for students and professionals.
Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to the US
will see high-level discussions on immigration, bilateral trade, and diplomatic cooperation.
Mass Deportations under the Trump Administration:
The Trump administration is
targeting undocumented migrants
, leading to mass deportations.
Key Statistics:
20,407 undocumented Indians
are under Trump’s immigration radar.
17,940 Indians

Latest Deportation Flights:
C-17 US military aircraft
carried
205 Indian nationals
from San Antonio, Texas, back to India.
Most of these individuals are from
Gujarat and Punjab
India has insisted on verifying nationality before accepting deported individuals.
Trump’s Immigration Crackdown and Policy Changes:
President Trump has declared illegal immigration a national emergency, implementing strict measures:
Enhanced Deportation Strategies:
Military aircraft are being used for deportations
, instead of commercial flights.
ICE is
coordinating with the FBI, DEA, and Border Patrol
to locate and arrest undocumented migrants.
Deportation arrests tripled
in January, with over
1,000 people detained in a single week
New Immigration Measures:
ICE has removed legal protections
granted under Biden’s administration.
CBP One mobile app
, which allowed migrants to schedule border entry appointments, has been shut down.
Birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented immigrants has been
eliminated

is being repurposed to
house 30,000 migrants
Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado
is also being used for migrant detention.
India’s Diplomatic Response and Concerns:
India has engaged in diplomatic efforts to manage the immigration issue without affecting bilateral ties:
India’s Position on Deportation:
India has agreed to accept undocumented Indians if nationality verification is confirmed.
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar conveyed India’s stand to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
India is against illegal immigration due to its links to organized crime and human trafficking.
Ensuring Legal Pathways for Migration:
Over 1 million visas were issued to Indian nationals in 2024, including record numbers of student and business visas.
72% of H-1B visas issued in the last fiscal year went to Indian professionals.
Trump has assured that the H-1B visa program will continue, though some reforms may be introduced.
Challenges in India-US Talks:
India has asked for discreet deportation measures to avoid political backlash.
Concerns remain over potential restrictions on Indian migration programs.
Trump’s Economic Leverage on Immigration Policy:
leveraged trade policies

**********India’s Push for Small Modular Reactors
Why in news?
India is advancing its entry into the global
(SMR) manufacturing value chain, receiving institutional support through three key policy enablers announced in the Union Budget.
These measures aim to catalyse development and strengthen India's position in nuclear energy innovation.
What’s in today’s article?
Legislative Reforms to Boost Private Participation in Nuclear Energy
Triggers for India’s Small Modular Reactor (SMR) Push
SMRs: The Future of Nuclear Energy
Global SMR Developments
New Vertical for Private Participation
The government plans to establish a separate division within the Department of Atomic Energy to facilitate private sector involvement in India's nuclear industry.
This mirrors the successful space sector reforms and aims to leverage private expertise for SMR design, fabrication, and technology transfer negotiations with global players.
Amendment to the Atomic Energy Act, 1962
The proposed amendment seeks to expand private sector participation beyond equipment supply, allowing private firms to operate nuclear power plants, including Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).
Currently, only NPCIL and its joint ventures with NTPC and NALCO have this authority.
Revisions to Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010
Changes are being considered to address foreign investment concerns regarding liability.
The current law assigns operator liability to equipment suppliers, discouraging global firms like GE-Hitachi, Westinghouse, and Areva from investing in India's nuclear sector.
Revisions aim to make investment conditions more favorable.
Need for Reliable Base-Load Power
As India reduces coal-fired power generation and increases renewable energy capacity, nuclear power is emerging as a stable and clean alternative.
Renewable sources like solar and wind face challenges due to intermittent power generation and lack of viable storage solutions.
Nuclear energy provides a round-the-clock power source to balance grid demands and support energy transition.
India’s Strategic Entry into SMR Manufacturing
India aims to position itself as a competitive player in SMR design and manufacturing, leveraging its decades of experience with small reactors and cost-effective production capabilities.
The move comes as China aggressively expands its SMR program, using it as a diplomatic tool for the Global South.
India seeks to counter China’s dominance in this emerging sector and establish itself as a credible alternative in the global SMR market.
SMRs (30MWe to 300MWe per unit) are seen as a cost-effective and flexible nuclear energy solution.
India is focusing on SMRs for
clean energy transition and as a strategic foreign policy tool to expand its global influence
India’s Collaboration Efforts
The Department of Atomic Energy is in exploratory talks with Holtec International (USA), a leading exporter of nuclear components, for possible partnerships.
Two operational SMR projects exist globally:
Russia’s Akademik Lomonosov (35 MWe x 2) – Floating SMR, operational since May 2020.
China’s HTR-PM (grid-connected in 2021, operational in 2023).
Western firms developing SMRs
: Rolls-Royce (UK), NuScale’s VOYGR (USA), Westinghouse’s AP300 (USA), GE-Hitachi’s BWRX-300 (USA), and Holtec’s SMR-300.

**********US-China trade tension escalates
Why in news?
US President Donald Trump delayed the imposition of 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada just hours before they were set to take effect, pausing the North American
trade war
for a month.
However, tensions with China escalated as Beijing retaliated against US tariffs by investigating Google for antitrust violations and imposing new tariffs on US coal, LNG, oil, and agricultural equipment.
Trump also hinted at upcoming tariffs on the EU, citing trade imbalances. Businesses are preparing for potential disruptions, while the EU’s role as a major trading partner, including for India, raises concerns about a broader global trade conflict.
What’s in today’s article?
Trump’s Trade War with China during his First Term
US tariffs on Chinese goods and possible benefits to India
Impact of Trump’s Tariffs
During his first term, US President Donald Trump initiated a trade war with China, resulting in retaliatory tariffs and countermeasures.
This eventually led to the
Phase One Deal
on January 15, 2020, which aimed at structural reforms and increased purchases by China.
However, subsequent analyses revealed that China neither met its purchase commitments nor implemented structural reforms.
The US tariffs on Chinese goods created opportunities for other countries, including India, to increase their exports to the US.
A study by
Oxford Economics
found that
India was the fourth-largest beneficiary of trade diversions between 2017 and 2023
, following Trump’s tariff measures.
electronics sector
saw significant gains, with India’s share in US imports rising
tenfold
since 2017, driven largely by
telecommunications equipment
like iPhones.
With the current 10% tariff on Chinese goods, Indian exporters see further potential to expand their market share in the US.
Indian exporters are receiving
higher orders
due to fears of increased tariffs on China, similar to what happened during the previous trade war.
India’s Competitiveness Challenges
Despite gains, India lags behind other Asian nations in high-tech manufacturing.
Korea and Taiwan dominate semiconductors, while China still supplies 27% of US electronics imports.
India’s Strategy to Attract Trade
To benefit from trade shifts, India cut customs duties on key imports in the Union Budget to streamline tariffs.
This move signals India's commitment to simplifying its tariff structure.
Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China would increase costs for American consumers, with an estimated annual burden of
over $1,200 per household
. US producers facing tariffed imports are expected to raise their prices, further fueling inflation.
US Inflation and Its Effect on Indian Exports
High inflation in the US and Europe has already impacted Indian exports, particularly in labour-intensive sectors like gems, jewellery, and textiles.
Rising costs and supply chain disruptions could further weaken demand for Indian goods.
Tax Policy and Economic Burden
Higher tariffs, coupled with potential recessionary impacts, could lead to a net tax increase for most US households.
On the competitiveness of US manufacturers
Economists explained that Trump’s 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports have weakened the competitiveness of US manufacturers, giving an advantage to rivals in Europe and Asia.
Impact on the US Auto Industry
American cars rely on parts from the US, Canada, and Mexico, making tariffs on these countries increase production costs.
As a result, US-made cars become more expensive, leading buyers to prefer imports from Japan, Germany, and Korea, which are not subject to tariffs.
Risk of Further Escalation
Experts predicted that if US consumers shift towards
cheaper foreign cars
, Trump may see it as
unfair competition
and respond by either:
Imposing a blanket 25% tariff on all imported cars
Negotiating export restrictions with Japan, Germany, and Korea
retaliatory cycle
could further escalate the
global trade war
, affecting multiple industries and economies.

**********India-Indonesia Ties as a Beacon for Global Relations
Context
The
relationship between India and Indonesia
is one of deep
historical significance and strategic importance.
recent visit of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto
as the chief guest at India’s 76th Republic Day celebrations
highlighted the strong bilateral ties
between the two nations.
This
visit served as a reminder of their shared history, economic potential, and security collaboration,
reinforcing their crucial role in shaping the Indo-Pacific region and global geopolitical dynamics.
India-Indonesia Relations: Historical Foundations and Evolution of Ties
Shared Struggles for Independence
The historical ties between India and Indonesia are
deeply rooted in shared experiences of colonisation, independence, and the subsequent quest for self-determination.
The relationship between the two nations
dates back to the period of their independence movements in the 20th century,
with both countries emerging as independent republics within a few years of each other.
India, having gained independence from British
rule in 1947,
quickly charted its course as the world’s largest democracy.
Indonesia followed in 1945, declaring its independence from Dutch colonial rule
, though it was not until 1949 that Indonesia’s sovereignty was internationally recognised.
Symbolic Beginnings: The 1950 Republic Day Invitation
first formal gesture of this mutual respect occurred in 1950,
during India’s inaugural Republic Day celebrations.
Indonesia’s founding father and first president, Sukarno, was invited to attend as the chief guest
, an honour that symbolised the beginning of a diplomatic relationship based on mutual understanding and cooperation.
moment set the tone for a relationship characterised by shared values of democracy
, non-alignment, and peaceful co-existence.
Strengthening Diplomatic and Economic Ties
As
both nations embarked on their journeys as newly sovereign states, their leaders recognized the importance
of developing strong diplomatic and economic ties
early years of their relationship were marked by cooperation in the international arena,
particularly
through the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM),
which both India and Indonesia played pivotal roles in shaping.
The NAM, established in the mid-20th century,
sought to create an alternative bloc to the Cold War divisions of the Western and Eastern blocs, emphasizing a third path that promoted peace, cooperation, and independence from superpower influence.
Bilateral Engagements and Cultural Exchange
In the decades following their independence,
the two countries strengthened their relationship through various bilateral engagements.
India and Indonesia signed numerous agreements
, including trade and economic cooperation pacts, and developed cultural exchanges that further deepened their ties.
These exchanges were reflective of both nations' rich cultural heritages,
which offered a strong foundation for mutual respect and collaboration.
Consistent Leadership Visits
repeated visits of Indonesian presidents to India,
including the recent visit by President Prabowo Subianto,
underscore the enduring nature of this partnership.
President Prabowo’s visit marked the fourth time an Indonesian leader had been invited as the chief guest for India’s Republic Day celebrations
, a testament to the consistent and growing importance of the relationship.
These visits have been instrumental in enhancing bilateral cooperation and opening new avenues for collaboration in diverse sectors
, including trade, defence, technology, and education.
The Key Aspects of India-Indonesia Relations
Trade as a Pillar of Growth
Economic cooperation has been a key aspect of India-Indonesia relations.
Although a trade agreement was signed in 1966,
there remains vast untapped potential for expanding economic ties.
Currently,
bilateral trade stands at approximately $30 billion
, but there are ambitions to quadruple this figure over the next decade.
A recent CEOs Forum in New Delhi, co-chaired by the Chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce
and Indian business leader Ajay S. Shriram,
identified five key sectors for growth: energy, food and agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing
, and technology.
By
focusing on innovation and strengthening bilateral supply chains, both nations can unlock new economic opportunities.
With projected economic growth rates of 6.5% for India and 5.1% for Indonesia, both nations are well-positioned to thrive despite global economic uncertainties.
Security and Strategic Cooperation
Security cooperation forms another crucial pillar of the India-Indonesia partnership.
2018 Comprehensive Strategic Partnership has significantly strengthened defence ties,
especially in maritime security.
As two nations with extensive coastlines and vital shipping lanes,
ensuring the safety of their waters is paramount.
President Prabowo’s visit further reinforced commitments to counterterrorism
and cybersecurity cooperation.
Given the evolving geopolitical landscape in the Indo-Pacific,
closer military and strategic collaboration is essential to safeguarding regional stability and economic prosperity.
Both countries recognise the need to address common security challenges, including cyber threats and territorial disputes.
Geopolitical Significance of India-Indonesia Relations
Beyond their bilateral relationship,
India and Indonesia play vital roles in global geopolitics.
Indonesia’s recent invitation to join the BRICS group aligns it with other emerging economies
, including India and China.
Meanwhile,
both nations maintain significant relations with the United States and other Western powers.
However,
global trade faces challenges, including potential U.S. tariffs that could impact both economies.
As a resource-rich nation,
Indonesia seeks to export key commodities
such as nickel, copper, tin, and bauxite
to markets like the U.S. and India
India’s expanding manufacturing sector presents opportunities for mutually beneficial trade arrangements.
Conclusion
President Prabowo’s visit reaffirmed the deep and enduring partnership
between India and Indonesia.
Their relationship, now 76 years old, continues to evolve,
driven by trade, security, and strategic cooperation.
As they navigate global economic and geopolitical shifts,
their collaboration will be instrumental in shaping the future of the Indo-Pacific and beyond.
By strengthening ties,
India and Indonesia not only enhance their own prosperity and security but also contribute to a more stable and sustainable world.

**********The U.S.’s Exit from WHO, A Chance to Reshape Global Health
Context
On January 20, 2025, the United States government issued an executive order to withdraw from the World Health Organisation (WHO)
, raising serious concerns about the financial and operational stability of the global health body.
While
this decision has sparked debate about the potential weakening of WHO due to reduced funding,
it also presents an
opportunity
to reevaluate the role of different nations in shaping the global health agenda.
Amid these developments,
it is important to explore the implications of the U.S.’s withdrawal, the challenges posed by WHO’s funding structure, and the need for the global south
to play a more significant role in global health.
WHO’s Funding System and the Consequences of U.S. Withdrawal
WHO’s funding is divided into
two major categories: assessed contributions (AC) and voluntary contributions (VC).
AC is a fixed annual membership fee
that each member-state is required to pay, which ensures stable funding for WHO’s basic operations, such as salaries and administrative costs.
One of the key reasons cited by the U.S
. for its withdrawal was that
its AC was disproportionately high.
On the other hand,
VC funds, which come from various donors and are often allocated to specific projects, are inherently unpredictable.
With the U.S. pulling out,
not only will its AC contributions be lost, but its VC funding may also diminish as U.S.-based donors
and agencies like USAID could reduce or halt their funding to WHO.
Given that many of these funds support critical projects like polio eradication,
patient safety, and antimicrobial resistance,
WHO’s ability to execute global health initiatives may be severely impacted.
However,
while the financial setback is significant, it also highlights the vulnerability of WHO’s funding structure
and the necessity for reform.
Reason Behind the Failure of Global Institutions
The Rise of Nationalism and its Impact on Global Collaboration
In recent years,
a wave of nationalism has swept across many countries
, leading to an increasing focus on domestic priorities at the expense of international cooperation.
Political leaders in high-income nations have increasingly adopted ‘nation-first’ policies
to appeal to their domestic constituencies.
This has
resulted in reduced funding for international institutions
, weakened alliances, and a reluctance to engage in multilateral efforts.
U.S. withdrawal from WHO is a prime example of this trend.
Citing concerns over financial contributions and bureaucratic inefficiencies,
government decided to pull out of an organisation that has historically been instrumental in coordinating global responses to health crises.
decision not only undermines WHO’s ability to function effectively but also sends a troubling signal
to other countries that international cooperation can be abandoned when politically convenient.
The Erosion of Trust in Global Institutions
Another major issue facing global institutions
is the erosion of trust among member states.
Over the years,
some countries have criticized organisations like WHO for being slow to act, overly bureaucratic
, and influenced by the interests of a few powerful nations.
While these criticisms are not entirely unfounded,
they have led to a situation where countries hesitate to fully support global initiatives
, fearing that their interests will not be adequately represented.
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed some of these shortcomings
WHO was criticised for its delayed response in declaring the virus a pandemic
and for its perceived over-reliance on information from certain member states.
These concerns, while valid, should serve as a catalyst for reform
rather than an excuse to abandon global institutions altogether.
A stronger WHO, one that is more transparent, efficient
, and equitably governed,
is essential to ensuring global health security.
The Need for Systemic Reforms in Global Institutions
Decentralisation of Global Health Governance
WHO’s headquarters in Geneva is
far removed from the regions that face the most pressing health challenges.
Relocating parts of WHO’s operations to regional offices in Africa or Asia could improve response
times and ensure that resources are directed where they are needed most.
Diversification of Funding Sources
To reduce dependency on any single country,
WHO and similar institutions should diversify their funding mechanisms.
Encouraging pooled contributions
from multiple countries, as well as innovative financing mechanisms such as global health bonds or public-private partnerships, could enhance financial stability.
Enhancing Inclusivity in Decision-Making
Historically, global health policies have been dominated by high-income countries.
Ensuring that low- and middle-income nations have a greater voice in decision-making processes
will lead to more equitable and effective policies.
This can be achieved by increasing representation from Africa, Asia, and Latin America in WHO’s leadership and governing bodies.
Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms
Currently, many global health agreements lack enforcement mechanisms, making it difficult to hold countries accountable.
Introducing legally binding commitments with penalties for non-compliance could enhance adherence
to global health protocols.
The Role of the Global South in Strengthening Institutions
In light of the challenges faced by global institutions,
countries in the global south must take a proactive role in shaping their future.
Instead of relying on high-income nations to dictate the global health agenda,
emerging economies like India, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand should step up as leaders
in international health governance.
Organisations like
BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) could play a pivotal role in funding and supporting WHO’s initiatives.
Additionally,
investing in global health training programs within the global south will help create a more diverse and self-sufficient pool of experts
, reducing dependence on Western-trained professionals.
Furthermore,
countries in Africa and Asia must advocate for fairer global health policies.
By collectively pushing for reforms in WHO
and other institutions,
they can ensure that global health priorities reflect the needs of all nations
, not just those of high-income countries.
Conclusion
from WHO presents immediate challenges,
it also provides an opportunity for restructuring global health governance.
decision underscores the need for a stronger WHO
that is less dependent on any single country for funding and expertise.
Countries in the global south must take the lead
in filling this gap by increasing financial contributions, training more experts, and establishing regional institutions dedicated to global health.
The withdrawal of the U.S. should not be seen as a crisis but rather as a catalyst
for a more independent and resilient WHO.

**********Revitalizing India's Nuclear Energy Sector - The Need for Reform
Context:
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her recent budget speech, announced amendments to two key atomic Acts (
the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and the CLNDA, 2010
) to revive India's nuclear energy sector.
This long-pending reform comes at a crucial time when the world is witnessing a nuclear energy resurgence.
India’s Declining Nuclear Prospects:
India was among the
early adopters
of nuclear energy, establishing its first nuclear power plant in
Tarapur (Maharashtra) in 1969
Despite early progress, India's nuclear power
capacity
has
stagnated
at around
8,200 MW
, whereas China and South Korea have significantly expanded their nuclear energy programs.
Successive governments have revised nuclear capacity targets but failed to meet them. The FM has now set a target of
1,00,000 MW by 2047
, necessitating legal reforms.
Historical Challenges and External Constraints:
India's nuclear progress was initially supported by
Western collaborations
in the 1950s.
The introduction of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1970
restricted nuclear technology transfers,
placing India at a disadvantage
India's 1974 nuclear test
(code named Smiling Buddha) led to
global sanctions
and enhanced nuclear cooperation between China and Pakistan.
The 1998 nuclear tests
(code named Operation Shakti) redefined India as a nuclear-weapon state, paving the way for the
India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement
(2005-08).
Impact of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010:
While the India-US nuclear deal created opportunities for civil nuclear cooperation, the CLNDA
restricted foreign and private investment
Global norms require liability for nuclear accidents to rest with the plant operator. However, India's CLNDA holds
suppliers accountable
, discouraging private and foreign participation.
The Modi government attempted to address this issue post-2014 but
failed to attract significant investment.
Structural Issues in India's Nuclear Policy:
The Atomic Energy Act, 1962
, grants the
government monopoly
over nuclear energy development, limiting private sector participation and resulting in
inadequate capital and slow expansion
It also
prevents the creation of a nuclear ecosystem
that can drive innovation, create economies of scale and develop networks of global collaboration to accelerate atomic power generation in India.
Today, the
Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)
relies entirely on government funding.
Lessons from Space Sector Reforms:
Private and public-sector companies such as
Tata, Godrej, L&T, Walchandnagar and BHEL
already supply critical nuclear components and could play a larger role in power plant construction.
Today, they are in a position to take charge of
building power plants
on their own while relying on the
DAE to provide some of the technologies.
The liberalization
of the space sector has spurred private investment and innovation.
A similar approach in nuclear energy,
with the DAE focusing on research and allowing private companies to build and operate nuclear plants, could accelerate growth.
Conclusion - The Path Forward:
Science-and-technology monopolies
have outlived their utility and have become a drag on the prospects for India’s technological transformation.
Government agencies like the
DAE, ISRO and DRDO
should focus on research and cede the production of equipment and related industrial activity to the private sector.
Amending the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and the CLNDA, 2010 is
crucial to unlocking India's nuclear potential.
Encouraging private sector participation,
ensuring investment-friendly liability laws
, and leveraging global partnerships will be key to meeting India's 2047 nuclear energy targets.
A reformed nuclear sector can significantly contribute to
India's energy security and green transition.

**********The financial toxicity of cancer care in India
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of Cancer;
Why in the News?
The financial strain of cancer is often ignored but can be the most harmful. It not only impacts the patient but also their family and future generations.
What is the extent of financial toxicity faced by cancer patients in India?
High Treatment Costs:
Cancer treatments, especially advanced options like immunotherapy, can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, a patient with oral cancer may face annual costs of approximately ₹10 lakh, adding to previous expenses that can total ₹25 lakh over several years. This financial strain often forces families to deplete savings or sell assets to afford care.
Impact on Families:
Financial toxicity extends beyond the patient to their families, leading to severe economic consequences. Families may resort to selling properties or skipping meals to manage treatment costs, which can entrap them in a cycle of generational poverty.
Out-of-Pocket Expenses:
A significant portion of healthcare costs is borne out-of-pocket by patients. For example, outpatient expenses can account for nearly 50% of total healthcare costs, which are not covered by insurance schemes like Ayushman Bharat.
What are the contributing factors to financial toxicity in cancer care?
Inadequate Public Health Funding:
India’s public health expenditure has historically been below 2% of GDP, resulting in insufficient healthcare infrastructure and personnel in public hospitals. This leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment, particularly for advanced cancer cases that require more costly interventions.
Limited Insurance Coverage:
Existing insurance schemes primarily cover inpatient costs, leaving patients responsible for outpatient diagnostics and follow-up treatments. This gap significantly contributes to the financial burden on patients and their families.
Economic Disparities:
Patients from low and middle-income backgrounds face additional hurdles in accessing cutting-edge treatments due to their high costs and limited availability in public health systems.
What are the steps taken by the Indian Government?
Health Minister’s Cancer Patient Fund (HMCPF):
Established in 2009 under the Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi, this fund provides financial assistance up to ₹5 lakh for cancer treatment at designated Regional Cancer Centers (RCCs).
In emergency cases, assistance can go up to ₹15 lakh. The fund aims to support patients living below the poverty line.
Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY):
This scheme offers health coverage of up to ₹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization, including cancer treatments. It is designed for low-income families and is operational across India.
State-Specific Schemes:
Various states have their own initiatives:
Arogyasri Scheme in Andhra Pradesh:
Provides free cancer treatment for families with an annual income below ₹5 lakh.
Free Chemotherapy in Odisha:
Offers free chemotherapy treatment at district hospitals for poor cancer patients.
Financial Assistance in Punjab:
Up to ₹1.5 lakh is provided for cancer treatment to eligible residents.
What strategies can be implemented to mitigate financial toxicity? (Way forward)
Strengthening Public Healthcare:
Increasing government investment in public health could improve access to affordable cancer care.
States like Delhi and Kerala have initiated schemes to support direct medical costs, but broader implementation is needed across India.
Supportive Measures for Non-Medical Costs:
Initiatives such as discounted travel fares for cancer patients can alleviate some financial burdens associated with non-medical expenses. Expanding these programs could provide significant relief.
Role of Nonprofits and CSR:
Nonprofit organizations play a crucial role in reducing out-of-pocket expenses through various support services. Increased funding from corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives could help these organisations expand their reach and impact.
Promoting Philanthropy:
Encouraging individual philanthropy among wealthier segments of society could provide critical funding for cancer care initiatives and nonprofits focused on assisting low-income patients.
Policy Advocacy:
Advocating for policies that address the gaps in insurance coverage and promote equitable access to cancer treatments is essential for reducing financial toxicity in the long term.
Mains PYQ:
What are the research and developmental achievements in applied biotechnology? How will these achievements help to uplift the poorer sections of the society?

**********How beggar-thy-neighbour policies can make global trade come to a standstill?
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Trade war;
Why in the News?
In 2025, the United States’ imposition of a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, exemplifies modern beggar-thy-neighbour policies.
What is Beggar-Thy-Neighbor Policy?
Beggar-thy-neighbor policies refer to
protectionist economic policies
in which economic strategies are adopted by a country to improve its own economic situation at the expense of other nations.
These policies often involve protectionist measures such as
tariffs, quotas, or currency devaluation,
which can lead to negative repercussions for trading partners. For example, recently the USA imposed tariffs on China.
What are the positive implications of this policy?
Domestic Economic Boost:
Proponents argue that these policies can stimulate the domestic economy by protecting local industries and jobs. For example, tariffs on imports can encourage consumers to buy domestic products, potentially reducing unemployment in key sectors.
National Security:
Supporters often cite national security concerns, suggesting that certain industries need protection from foreign competition to maintain a robust domestic economy.
Encouragement of Exports:
By depreciating the national currency, a country can make its exports cheaper and more competitive in international markets, which is believed to enhance demand for domestic goods abroad.
What do the critics say?
Global Economic Decline
– The
U.S.-China Trade War (2018-Present)
illustrates how protectionist policies can escalate into retaliatory actions.
The U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting China to retaliate with its own tariffs, disrupting global supply chains and reducing international trade volumes.
Higher Consumer Prices
U.S. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum (2018)
under Section 232 increased production costs for American industries relying on these metals, such as automobile and construction sectors.
A study by the Federal Reserve found that these tariffs cost U.S. consumers and businesses over $1.4 billion per month.
Historical Warnings
Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930)
in the U.S. significantly raised tariffs on imports, leading to retaliation from trading partners like Canada and European nations.
This contributed to a sharp decline in global trade and worsened the Great Depression. Global exports fell by nearly
two-thirds between 1929 and 1934,
demonstrating the adverse effects of widespread protectionism.
Reduced Innovation and Efficiency
– India’s
License Raj (1947–1991)
is a prime example of how excessive protectionism stifled innovation. The heavily regulated economy limited foreign competition, leading to inefficiencies, outdated technology, and slow economic growth.
Post-1991 economic liberalization, which reduced trade barriers, spurred competition, efficiency, and innovation across various industries.
Which countries use this policy?
U.S. Tariffs and Trade War
– Under the “America First” policy, the U.S. imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2018 to shield domestic industries. In response, China introduced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, escalating a trade war that disrupted global markets.
China’s Currency Policies
– China has been accused of currency manipulation to maintain trade advantages. In 2019, the U.S. Treasury labeled China a currency manipulator after the People’s Bank of China allowed the yuan to depreciate, making Chinese exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
Japan’s Currency Interventions
– To boost exports during economic stagnation, Japan’s central bank has weakened the yen through market interventions. While this makes Japanese exports more competitive, it raises import costs for domestic consumers and affects trading partners negatively.
Germany’s Eurozone Trade Advantage
– Germany’s strong export-driven economy, supported by fiscal discipline and manufacturing strength, has been seen as creating imbalances within the Eurozone. During financial crises, weaker European economies struggle to compete, intensifying economic disparities.
Does India use this policy?
In recent times, India has indeed engaged in practices that can be characterized as
beggar-thy-neighbor policies
, particularly in the context of trade and economic strategy.
Tariffs on Imports:
India has imposed tariffs on various goods to protect its domestic industries.
For instance, in 2018, India raised import duties on a range of products, including electronics and agricultural goods, to encourage local manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign imports. Such measures can be seen as attempts to bolster India’s economy at the expense of exporting countries.
Restrictions on Chinese Imports:
Following geopolitical tensions, India has implemented stricter regulations and tariffs on imports from China.
This includes bans on several Chinese apps (like tiktok) and increased scrutiny of Chinese investments.
Way forward:
Balanced Trade Policies:
Countries should adopt a mix of strategic protectionism and open trade to safeguard domestic industries while preventing trade wars.
Strengthening WTO mechanisms and engaging in fair trade negotiations can ensure economic stability.
Focus on Competitiveness:
Instead of relying on protectionist measures, nations should invest in innovation, skill development, and infrastructure to enhance global competitiveness, ensuring sustainable economic growth without harming trading partners.

**********Why the tax cuts are a one way gamble?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to the Judiciary;
Why in the News?
The Union Budget offers a major tax cut, benefiting taxpayers earning above ₹7 lakh. Rebates and exemptions have increased to reduce liabilities, though it may lead to an estimated ₹1 lakh crore revenue loss.
What is the logic behind the tax rebates?
Boosting Household Consumption:
Taxpayers earning ₹7–12 lakh/year now qualify for a full rebate (earlier limited to sub-₹7 lakh earners), saving ₹70,000–₹1.1 lakh annually.
This exemption limit was raised from ₹3 lakh to ₹4 lakh for those earning above ₹12 lakh, reducing tax burdens across income groups.It will Increase disposable income to drive consumption, savings, and private investment.
With weak private investment and uncertain global demand, tax rebates are aimed at stimulating domestic consumption.
Leveraging Tax Buoyancy for Revenue Growth:
Despite an 8% tax rate reduction, the government anticipates a 14% rise in direct tax revenue (₹14.3 lakh crore), requiring a 24% income growth among taxpayers. It Simplified tax slabs and phased out the old regime to improve compliance and widen the taxpayer base.
Focus on Middle-Class Welfare:
The overarching goal of these tax rebates is to support the middle class, which constitutes a significant portion of the electorate and plays a vital role in the economy. By alleviating their tax burden, the government seeks to enhance their financial well-being and foster a more equitable economic environment.
What are the implications if tax buoyancy does not work out?
Revenue Shortfalls:
A failure in tax buoyancy would lead to lower than expected tax revenues, resulting in budget deficits. This could force the government to cut essential services and social programs, negatively impacting the welfare of vulnerable populations.
Pro-Cyclical Fiscal Policy:
Insufficient tax revenue may compel the government to adopt a pro-cyclical fiscal policy, reducing public spending during economic downturns instead of stimulating growth. This can exacerbate economic slowdowns and hinder recovery efforts.
Increased Tax Burden on Compliant Taxpayers:
To compensate for revenue shortfalls, the government might increase taxes on those who continue to pay taxes, placing a heavier burden on compliant taxpayers and potentially discouraging further compliance and economic activity.
Is it ‘Fiscal Consolidation’ or ‘Fiscal Contraction’?
The current approach appears to lean
more towards fiscal contraction rather than fiscal consolidation.
The Finance Minister has set a lower deficit target of 4.4% for 2025-26, down from 4.8% in the previous year. This suggests a tightening of fiscal policy rather than an expansion aimed at stimulating growth.
Critics argue that such contractionary measures are ill-timed given the current economic slowdown, as they limit the government’s ability to invest in growth-promoting initiatives. The expectation seems to hinge on corporate investment and export growth to drive recovery, which may not be sufficient if domestic demand remains weak due to reduced government spending.
Aspect
Consolidation Argument
Contraction Criticism
Deficit Target
Lowered to 4.4% of GDP (from 4.8% in FY24), aiming for 3% by FY29
Aggressive deficit cuts during slowing growth (projected 10.1% nominal GDP) risk stifling recovery
Revenue Strategy
Bank on ₹28.37 trillion net tax receipts (+11% YoY) via compliance gains and income growth
No compensatory taxes for high earners (30% slab unchanged) or wealth assets, risking ₹1.26 lakh crore shortfall
Expenditure Focus
Capital expenditure raised to ₹11.2 lakh crore (+17.4% YoY) for infrastructure multipliers
Social sector allocations remain stagnant, with FY24 revised spending 15% below initial estimates.
Way forward:
Balanced Fiscal Approach
– Instead of aggressive fiscal contraction, the government should adopt a gradual deficit reduction strategy while maintaining targeted public spending, especially in infrastructure and social sectors, to sustain domestic demand and economic growth.
Enhancing Revenue without Burdening Taxpayers
– Strengthen tax compliance through digital tracking, rationalize subsidies, and explore progressive taxation on wealth and high-income segments to ensure fiscal stability without increasing the burden on the middle class.

Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
Bridging Healthcare Gaps (2015),
WHO Initiatives (2020).
The US is the largest contributor to WHO, providing about
18% of its funding
. The withdrawal is expected to jeopardize critical health programs, particularly those addressing
tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other health emergencies.
Today’s editorial emphasizes the
need for member states to collaborate
more effectively in light of reduced US involvement, ensuring that global health priorities remain addressed despite funding challenges. This content can be used to present the
significance of multilateral collaboration
and its
impact on international policy and governance
with respect to Health.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
After the USA’s withdrawal from WHO, it is time for the countries in the global south to support WHO and initiate collaborative actions to reshape the global health agenda.
What are the Potential Impacts of the US Withdrawal from WHO?
Disruption of Funding and Programs:
The US contributes nearly 18% of WHO’s budget (~$1 billion annually), supporting critical health programs like immunization, tuberculosis control, and pandemic preparedness.
The withdrawal will likely disrupt ongoing projects aimed at combating health challenges such as HIV/AIDS and polio eradication.
Weakened Global Health Response:
WHO’s ability to coordinate responses to health crises will be significantly impaired without US support. This includes reduced resources for disease surveillance and emergency operations in regions facing outbreaks or health threats.
Impact on Global Health Leadership and Collaboration:
The absence of the US may create a leadership vacuum within WHO, allowing other nations (e.g., China) to increase their influence.
This shift could alter international collaboration dynamics and lead to fragmented approaches to public health challenges.
Repercussions for Low-Income Countries:
Marginalized communities in low-income countries may face disproportionate impacts due to reduced funding from WHO. These communities rely heavily on WHO for access to essential health services, and the withdrawal signals a deprioritization of global health initiatives, exacerbating existing inequalities.
The overall effectiveness of global health initiatives may decline as WHO struggles with funding constraints and could slow
long-term progress
toward key health goals, such as disease eradication and comprehensive vaccination programs, ultimately affecting global health security.
How might the withdrawal reshape international health diplomacy?
Shift in Global Health Leadership:
The absence of the US may create a leadership vacuum within WHO, potentially allowing countries like China to increase their influence in global health governance.
This shift could alter the dynamics of international collaboration, with other nations stepping up to fill the void left by the US.
Increased Geopolitical Tensions:
The withdrawal could intensify competition between the US and China for influence in global health matters.
China’s initiatives, such as the Health Silk Road, may gain traction as it seeks to position itself as a leader in global health, thereby
reshaping alliances and partnerships among countries.
Impact on Multilateral Cooperation:
The US’s exit may weaken multilateral cooperation on critical health issues, leading to
fragmented responses
to global health challenges.
Countries may become less willing to collaborate on shared health threats without US leadership, which could hinder effective pandemic preparedness and response efforts.
Loss of Diplomatic Leverage:
By withdrawing, the US relinquishes its role as a key influencer in shaping global health policies and initiatives.
This could
diminish its ability to advocate for public health programs
that align with its interests and values, allowing other nations to take a more prominent role in setting global health agendas.
Disproportionate Effects:
that rely heavily on WHO for support may face greater challenges without US involvement.
What reforms or changes might be necessary within WHO in light of this withdrawal?
Diversification of Funding Sources:
WHO should encourage member states to
increase their assessed contributions,
which currently cover less than 20% of its budget. This could help reduce reliance on any single donor, particularly the US.
WHO can seek to
expand its voluntary contributions
from other countries and private organizations to fill the financial gap left by the US withdrawal.
Strengthening Governance and Accountability:
Implementing
more transparent financial management
practices can help restore trust among member states and ensure that funds are allocated effectively.
Establishing an
independent oversight body
to review WHO’s operations and decision-making processes may help address concerns about political influence and enhance accountability.
What opportunity do India have in this situation?
Increased Leadership Role:
India can take a prominent leadership position within WHO, representing the Global South.
For Example,
through the
Vaccine Maitri initiative
, India facilitated vaccine exports during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its commitment to global health equity and influencing health policies.
Strengthening Domestic Capabilities:
The withdrawal allows India to bolster its healthcare infrastructure and research capabilities.
significant investments in indigenous vaccine production, such as
Covaxin and Covishield,
have positioned India as a major player in global vaccine supply chains, enhancing self-reliance and healthcare outcomes.
Enhanced Collaboration with Emerging Economies:
India can forge stronger partnerships with other emerging economies to collaboratively address global health challenges.
engagement with countries like
Brazil and South Africa through the IBSA
Dialogue Forum can focus on shared issues like antimicrobial resistance and maternal health, enhancing collective responses to public health threats.
Leveraging Pharmaceutical Strength
: India’s robust pharmaceutical industry can fill gaps left by reduced WHO funding.
Known as the
“pharmacy of the world,
” India supplied affordable vaccines during the pandemic, reinforcing its reputation as a key player in global healthcare by continuing to produce low-cost medications.
Way Forward:
India can not only mitigate the impacts of the US withdrawal but also can significantly contribute to shaping a more equitable global health landscape.
