**********Denali Fault
The Denali Fault split apart the ancient connection of landmasses.
Key Findings on the Denali Fault:
, located in
southern Alaska
, has played a crucial role in shaping Earth's geological history.
A study reveals that
three sites along the Denali Fault
were once part of a
single geologic feature
, symbolizing the
final joining of two landmasses
millions of years ago.
Over
483 km of horizontal movement
along the fault tore apart this united feature due to
millions of years of tectonic activity
These three locations once formed a
terminal suture zone
, indicating the last phase of tectonic plate integration into a larger mass.
About Fault Lines
Definition:
fault line
is the visible intersection of a geological fault with the Earth's surface. It refers to a
fracture or zone of fractures
between two blocks of rock caused by stresses generated by tectonic plate movements.
Characteristics of Faults:
Faults are closely associated with the movement of Earth's
tectonic plates
largest faults
are found along plate boundaries.
Movement along faults can occur
rapidly
, resulting in earthquakes, or
gradually
, in the form of creep.
Faults vary in length from a few millimeters to
thousands of kilometers
, such as the
San Andreas Fault
in California or the
Anatolian Fault
in Turkey.
Fault surfaces can be
horizontal, vertical
, or inclined at various angles.
Earth scientists classify faults based on the
angle of the fault
relative to the surface (known as the dip) and the
direction of movement
along the fault.
Types of Faults:
Strike-Slip Faults
: These faults occur when
tectonic plates slide past each other horizontally
, with little to no vertical movement.
These faults are commonly found in regions where
lateral stress dominates
A well-known example is the
in California, which has caused several powerful earthquakes.
Normal Faults
one block of rock slides downward
, pulling away from the adjacent block.
These faults create space by
stretching the Earth's crust
, often leading to the formation of valleys.
Examples of normal faults include the
Basin and Range Province
in North America and the
East African Rift Zone
Reverse Faults (Thrust Faults)
:  These
occur when one block of crust moves
upward
and overlaps the other.
This process is associated with
compression
and often leads to the formation of
mountain ranges
Examples include the
Himalayas
, formed due to the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates, and the
Rocky Mountains
in North America.

Drawbacks of QKD
National Quantum Mission (NQM)
About
NQM, launched by the Department of Science & Technology, aims to harness quantum physics for next-generation communication and sensing systems.
While classical physics has driven technological advances like telecommunications, AI, and weather forecasting, it is approaching its performance limits.
Quantum physics, offering capabilities beyond classical systems, promises revolutionary devices with enhanced abilities.
Budget
Approved by the Union Cabinet in April 2023 with a budget of Rs 6,000 crore, the NQM will run from 2023 to 2031.
A key initiative under the mission is the development of a quantum satellite, scheduled for launch within 2-3 years, to pioneer quantum communications.
It is a communications satellite leveraging quantum physics to secure signals against interception.
Communication technologies rely heavily on security to prevent unauthorized access during message transmission across networks.
The rise of quantum computers poses a threat to current encryption methods.
However, quantum physics also enables advanced security measures, with
quantum satellites
playing a pivotal role in ensuring robust, next-generation protection.
Encryption as a Solution
Modern communication tools like WhatsApp secure messages through encryption.
Encryption converts messages into a secret code before transmission, which can only be decoded by the recipient using the correct key.
If intercepted, the message remains unreadable without the key.
Cryptographic Security
This system relies on hiding the decryption key behind complex mathematical problems.
While the sender's and recipient's devices already have the solution, an eavesdropper would require immense computing power and time to crack the code.
Quantum Cryptography and QKD
Quantum cryptography secures messages using principles of quantum physics, with
being its most well-known application.
QKD ensures that if an eavesdropper intercepts the key during transmission, the breach is detected, and the sharing is aborted.
Quantum Measurement for Security
Quantum physics states that measuring a quantum system, like a photon, changes its state.
If eavesdropper measures photons carrying the key (encoded in two states, 0 and 1), the state will change, alerting the compromise.
Quantum Entanglement
Quantum entanglement links two photons such that a change in one immediately affects the other.
This property helps detect eavesdropping, ensuring
unconditional security
Development and Current Progress
While QKD protocols and technologies are still a decade from standardization, progress has been significant:
China operates the world’s largest QKD network with three satellites and four ground stations.
Experiments since 1992 have extended the distance of reliable QKD transmissions to several hundred kilometres via fibre-optic cables or free space.
Notable Experiments
China (2013):
Researchers implemented QKD between a ground station and a moving hot-air balloon 20 km above, supporting the feasibility of quantum satellites.
India (2024):
A study by the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, found the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle, Ladakh, to be ideal for satellite-based QKD due to low signal loss (44 dB compared to 50 dB in China’s experiment).
India’s Planned Quantum Satellite
The planned satellite will transmit signals at a
main wavelength of 810 nm
, with uplink and downlink wavelengths at 532 nm and 1550 nm, respectively.
The projected beam distance is 500 km.
Criticism by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)
The NSA recommends post-quantum cryptography over QKD due to the following limitations:
Lack of Authentication
: QKD doesn’t authenticate the source of the transmission.
Hardware Dependence
: QKD networks rely on hardware that can’t be easily upgraded or patched.
High Costs and Risks
: Infrastructure costs and insider threats limit its feasibility for many use cases.
Limited Real-World Security
: The security achieved depends on hardware and engineering designs, not the theoretical unconditional security promised by quantum physics.
Vulnerability to Attacks
: Eavesdroppers can cause denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by halting transmissions.
Restrictions Imposed by Quantum Physics
No-Cloning Theorem
: Quantum information can’t be amplified like classical information, restricting its transmission across large distances.
Post-Quantum Cryptography as an Alternative
Post-quantum cryptography uses advanced classical encryption techniques to resist attacks from both quantum and classical devices, making it a more practical solution in some cases.

**********US court holds Israeli company NSO liable for targeting WhatsApp users
Why in news?
Meta's WhatsApp secured a significant legal win as a US federal court found the Israeli firm NSO Group liable under federal and California laws for spyware attacks targeting around 1,400 devices.
WhatsApp had sued NSO in 2019, accusing it of using Pegasus spyware to hack and surveil the phones of nearly 1,400 individuals during a two-week period in May 2019. The court will now determine the damages.
What’s in today’s article?
Pegasus Spyware
Pegasus in India
Background of the Case
Key highlights of the ruling
Significance of the Ruling
About
Pegasus is spyware that can infect phones via exploit links or missed video calls (no user interaction needed).
Once installed, it grants complete access to the target's phone, including passwords, messages, calls, camera, and microphone.
Capabilities of Pegasus
Accesses private data, passwords, contact lists, calendar events, emails, SMS, and browsing history.
Activates the phone’s camera and microphone for live surveillance.
Works on Android, iOS, BlackBerry, and Symbian devices.
Leaves no trace, has a self-destruct feature, and uses minimal resources to avoid detection.
At least two dozen Indian academics, lawyers, Dalit activists, and journalists were targeted.
NSO claims it only provides Pegasus to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
Pegasus Spyware’s Global and Indian Impact
Pegasus spyware has reportedly targeted government officials, journalists, human rights activists, and diplomats worldwide, including in India.
In 2021, it was alleged that Pegasus was used to monitor over 300 Indian phone numbers, including those of Union Ministers, opposition leaders, journalists, and civil society members.
The NSO Group claims it only sells Pegasus to governments, but documents from the WhatsApp case revealed the company played a significant role in deploying the spyware, contrary to its claims of limited involvement.
Indian Government’s Denial and Supreme Court Probe
The Indian government denied allegations of Pegasus misuse, with IT Minister calling the claims baseless and asserting that Indian surveillance laws prevent unauthorized monitoring.
Following public outcry, the
Supreme Court of India formed a technical expert committee in 2021
to investigate the allegations.
In its 2022 report, the committee found no conclusive evidence of Pegasus use but noted the Central Government's lack of cooperation.
The report remains sealed and unreleased.
In October 2019, WhatsApp, owned by Meta, filed a lawsuit against Israeli technology company NSO Group in the US District Court of Northern California.
The suit alleged that NSO had exploited a bug in WhatsApp to install its Pegasus spyware on the devices of 1,400 users, including activists, journalists, and members of civil society. Pegasus was used by NSO’s government clients to extract sensitive data from target devices.
Violation of Cybersecurity Laws
The court ruled that NSO Group violated the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
, a federal law criminalizing unauthorized digital access, and California’s
Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA)
The ruling stated that NSO had exploited WhatsApp’s servers to install Pegasus spyware and gain unauthorized access to users' devices.
Terms of Service Breach
The court also concluded that NSO Group violated WhatsApp’s terms of service by reverse-engineering and decompiling its source code.
The court reasoned that NSO must have agreed to WhatsApp’s terms to gain access to its software, further solidifying the breach.
WhatsApp’s Response
WhatsApp hailed the ruling as a significant victory for privacy. It emphasized that spyware companies should not evade accountability.
This ruling is notable as no prior court had held NSO Group accountable for its spyware.
It sets a precedent that surveillance companies cannot claim immunity or avoid liability for unlawful actions.
Conclusion
The court ruling against NSO Group highlights increasing scrutiny of the misuse of spyware like Pegasus. In India, the spyware has stirred political and legal debates, with unresolved allegations of its use against politicians, journalists, and activists. The sealed Supreme Court report and the global ramifications of the Pegasus scandal underline the need for transparency and accountability.
