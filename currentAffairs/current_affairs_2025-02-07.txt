Grameen Credit Score
Recently, finance minister of India announced Grameen credit score scheme in the union budget 2025.
About Grameen Credit Score:
It aims to
formalize self-help group
(SHG) transactions within the central credit system of India, thereby allowing leading financial institutions to better assess creditworthiness.
The objective behind this scheme is to
promote financial inclusion
for self-help group (SHGs) women entrepreneurs.
It is basically to provide them the much-needed support to grow in life by trying to build businesses.
This score, hence, represents a significant shift in analysing the creditworthiness of millions of women involved in the SHGs across India's rural areas.
The introduction of the Grameen credit score is expected to bring several positive changes:
Enhanced financial access:
It will open up new financial opportunities for rural women. Thus, enabling them to expand their businesses and improve their livelihoods. It will also introduce them with concepts like credit cards, creditworthiness, loan EMIs, loan repayment etc.
Customized financial products:
It will be supplemented by customized credit cards for micro-enterprises,
with limits of up to ₹5 lakh.
This will propel grassroot level financial empowerment.
Improved credit assessment:
By providing a digital framework for assessing creditworthiness, it will
bridge existing gaps in the current credit bureau
system, which often overlooks SHG members. It will also allow them to check their credit score, credit limits and ways to improve the same.
Economic stability:
Now with increase in credit availability women led SHGs will be in a position to better contribute more effectively to their houses. This will propel the growth in the rural community at large.

**********International Criminal Court (ICC)
U.S. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court over investigations of Israel, a close U.S. ally.
About International Criminal Court (ICC):
It is the
only permanent international criminal tribunal.
It was established
in 2002
by an international agreement, the
Rome Statute,
on 17 July 1998.
The Rome Statute sets out the Court’s jurisdiction, structures, and functions.
The Statute entered into force on 1 July 2002.
Mandate
: ICC investigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity
and the
crime of aggression
As a court of last resort, it seeks to
complement, not replace, national Courts.
Members
: There are
125 member countrie
s, but dozens of governments are
not ICC parties, including China, India, Israel, Russia
United States.
Funding
: The Court is funded by
contributions from the States Parties and by voluntary contributions
from Governments, international organizations, individuals, corporations, and other entities.
Composition
Judges
: The court has
18 judges
each from
a different member country,
elected to non-renewable
9-year terms.

**********Jevons Paradox
Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella discusses Jevons Paradox, noting that improved efficiency in AI may boost its demand and make it a commodity.
About Jevons Paradox:
It is the idea that
technological progress
that makes a
resource cheaper
or more efficient to use often leads to an
increase in demand for that resource.
This refers to a
form of induced demand
wherein efficiency improvements in the use of a resource causes increased consumption of the resource rather than a decrease in its use.
Origin of Jevons Paradox:
It was proposed by the English economist,
William Stanley Jevons
, in his 1865 book
The Coal Question
Jevons observed that the
efficient use of coal
made possible by technology actually caused more coal to be extracted and consumed rather than allowing the preservation of existing reserves.
Technological progress, in other words, only allows people to satisfy demands that could not be satisfied earlier in the absence of an appropriate technology.
Examples of Jevons Paradox:
Fuel Efficiency and Vehicle Usage:
Vehicle fuel efficiency improvements can also increase consumption. When cars become more fuel-efficient, the cost of driving per mile decreases, making it more affordable for individuals to use their vehicles — often increasing vehicle miles travelled, offsetting any energy conservation benefits from improved fuel efficiency.
Digital Technology and Energy Consumption:
The rise of digital technology and the internet has undoubtedly brought numerous benefits to society. Yet, the proliferation of intelligent devices and data centres has substantially increased energy consumption.

**********India’s Climate Strategy: A Shift Towards Adaptation and Economic Growth
What’s in Today’s Article?
India’s Climate Strategy (Economic Growth, Economic Survey, India’s Energy Choices, Role of Nuclear Energy, etc.)
India’s Changing Climate Strategy:
India has subtly but significantly shifted its stance on the global climate crisis, prioritizing adaptation over stringent emission reduction targets.
This policy change reflects the nation’s focus on rapid economic growth as a defense against climate change.
The government has increasingly questioned the international climate regime’s fixation on achieving specific temperature goals.
Instead,
India argues that developing countries like itself must focus on resilience and adaptation rather than aggressive decarbonization
, which could hamper economic progress.
This stance is not entirely new, but it is now being articulated more clearly and assertively. By doing so, India is creating more flexibility in its climate policies, ensuring that its national interests remain paramount while contributing to global climate efforts on its own terms.
Economic Growth as a Climate Shield:
India’s reassessment of its climate policy stems from a pragmatic understanding of global realities.
Despite international commitments, the world remains far from achieving its emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2035. In fact, global emissions are still rising, largely due to inaction by developed nations.
Given this scenario,
India sees little incentive to divert its limited resources toward aggressive mitigation efforts
The benefits of emission reduction are only realized when the entire world cuts emissions significantly, and even then, the impact is not immediate.
On the other hand, adaptation offers direct and local benefits. Strengthening infrastructure, improving water management, and enhancing disaster resilience can protect communities from climate change’s immediate effects.
Additionally,
economic prosperity plays a crucial role in resilience, reinforcing India’s argument that development is the best shield against climate risks
The Economic Survey 2024-25: A Blueprint for Growth and Sustainability
The Economic Survey 2024-25 strongly supports this approach. It advocates that
India must first reach the standards of a developed nation by 2047 before focusing aggressively on achieving net zero emissions by 2070
This recommendation aligns with India’s efforts to balance rapid industrialization with long-term sustainability.
Lessons from China:
India appears to be following a trajectory similar to China’s, which prioritized economic expansion and industrialization over emission concerns.
Since the mid-1990s,
China’s emissions have quadrupled, yet it has simultaneously built the world’s largest renewable energy infrastructure
Now, as its emissions approach their peak, China is in a position to transition to clean energy at an unprecedented pace.
India aims to replicate this model, ensuring that economic development is not compromised while also preparing for a future shift towards cleaner energy.
Reduced Global Pressure on India’s Energy Choices:
Another factor influencing India’s climate stance is the
declining global focus on climate action
. Despite 2023 and 2024 setting new temperature records, international priorities have shifted due to geopolitical tensions, economic challenges, and technological conflicts.
Additionally, developing nations have grown increasingly frustrated with the international climate framework’s shortcomings.
At the
COP29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan
, the financial commitments made to assist developing nations in combating climate change were disappointingly low. This has further eroded trust in the global climate process, as developing countries feel their concerns are not being adequately addressed.
Moreover, the
decision of U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in January 2025 and his push for increased fossil fuel production have significantly altered the global climate landscape
With major economies prioritizing their energy needs over climate commitments, India faces reduced pressure to phase out coal and other conventional energy sources.
A Unique Climate and Energy Pathway:
Despite this shift, India is not abandoning its decarbonization efforts. The government recognizes that long-term economic growth must align with low-carbon development to remain competitive in the global clean energy market.
India asserts that its transition to cleaner energy should be determined by its own policies rather than external pressures.
However, achieving this goal requires significant advancements in domestic clean energy manufacturing and technology.
If India does not develop its own capabilities in renewable energy, nuclear power, and green hydrogen, it risks continued dependence on foreign supply chains, limiting its ability to make independent energy choices.
The Role of Nuclear Energy in India’s Future:
One of the key areas where India is looking to expand its energy portfolio is nuclear power.
The country has been relatively slow in scaling up nuclear energy capacity despite having the necessary international agreements in place, such as the India-U.S. civil nuclear deal and the Nuclear Suppliers Group waiver.
To accelerate nuclear energy adoption, India is now focusing on
Small Modular Reactors
(SMRs).
Even with
ambitious targets of achieving 100 GW of nuclear power by 2047, nuclear energy would still constitute less than 10% of India’s total electricity capacity
Therefore, India must also scale up other renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydrogen to meet its clean energy goals.
Balancing Development and Climate Responsibility:
India’s evolving climate stance is a strategic recalibration rather than a retreat from its commitments. By prioritizing adaptation and economic growth, the country aims to build resilience while maintaining flexibility in its approach to emission reduction.
At the same time,
India recognizes that transitioning to clean energy is inevitable and must be integrated into its long-term development strategy
In essence,
India’s climate policy shift is about exercising sovereignty over its developmental choices while ensuring that its long-term growth aligns with sustainability goals.
The challenge ahead is to strike the right balance between economic prosperity and environmental responsibility, a task that will shape India’s future in the global climate landscape.

**********US G20 Move - A Signal to ICJ, A Diplomatic Challenge for India
Why in news?
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he will
not
attend the
Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Johannesburg, criticizing South Africa for using the summit to push "DEI and climate change" under the guise of solidarity and sustainability.
President Donald Trump accused South Africa of land confiscation and mistreating certain groups, vowing to cut future funding until an investigation is conducted.
Trump’s ally Elon Musk has also claimed, without evidence, that South Africa follows an anti-white policy.
What’s in today’s article?
Rubio’s Boycott: A Response to South Africa’s Case Against Israel
US Moves to Undermine The Hague Courts
Uncertain Future for the G20 Under Trump 2.0
India’s Stakes in G20 and Possible Scenarios
Marco Rubio’s decision to skip the G20 meeting is primarily linked to South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which has been gaining international backing.
ICJ (International Court of Justice)
: A UN judicial body that handles disputes between states.
Prominent Republicans leaders have condemned the ICJ, calling it biased against Israel.
They even threatened sanctions against countries supporting potential ICC arrest warrants for Israeli leaders.
ICC (International Criminal Court)
: Established in 2002 under the Rome Statute, it prosecutes individuals for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
South Africa’s Countermove
In response, South Africa and Malaysia launched a campaign to protect ICJ and ICC rulings, forming the
nine-nation "Hague Group" to defend Palestinian rights and challenge US attempts to weaken international courts
During his first term (2017–21), President Trump imposed sweeping sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The Biden administration later reversed these sanctions, backing ICC investigations into Russian war crimes in Ukraine.
US support for the ICC weakened after the court sought arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas leaders.
In response, the US House of Representatives passed a new ICC sanctions bill, now under Senate review.
While Rubio’s criticism appears directed at South Africa as G20 chair.
However, it raises concerns about the new US administration’s commitment to the multilateral platform if it chooses to disengage.
Upcoming G20 Meetings and US Participation
The G20 Foreign Ministers’ meeting is set for February 20–21, with the Leaders’ Summit scheduled for November 22–23.
President Trump, along with other global leaders, is expected to attend.
South Africa holds the G20 presidency until November 2025
Trump’s Approach to G20
During his first term, Trump’s “America First” policies led to friction within G20 but also reshaped its agenda, shifting focus from free trade to “reciprocal trade” in line with his trade war against China.
Unlike his first term, where the US remained engaged despite tensions,
a more radical second-term agenda could see Trump deprioritizing the G20, potentially undermining cooperation within the group
India has positioned the G20 as a more effective platform than the UN for addressing global challenges.
Its leadership of the Global South has benefited from the G20’s rising influence and India’s active role in the group.
US Support Under Biden vs. Uncertainty Under Trump
The Biden administration backed India’s G20 presidency in 2023, seeing India as a bridge between the Global North and South.
However, Trump 2.0’s priorities differ significantly, raising concerns about continued US engagement.
Worst-Case Scenario: US Disengagement from G20
If the US skips the South Africa G20 summit or withdraws entirely, it would weaken the group and potentially increase Russian and Chinese influence, complicating India’s strategic interests.
Alternative Scenario: Tactical Negotiations
Rubio’s tweet could be a pressure tactic, signalling a desire for negotiations.
If South Africa adopts a more conciliatory stance, US participation may continue, reducing negative impacts on G20 and India.
India’s Diplomatic Challenge with the Global South
A transactional Trump administration may not value India’s role as a Global South leader.
If US-Western support for India’s bridging role diminishes, India’s diplomatic positioning could face new hurdles.

**********Aga Khan IV
Why in news?
Prince Karim al-Husseini, Aga Khan IV, passed away in Lisbon at the age of 88.
A direct descendant of Prophet Muhammad through Fatima and Ali, he was the Imam of the
Nizari Ismaili Shias
and held near-divine status within the community.
What’s in today’s article?
Shia-Sunni Split and Shia Denominations
Nizari Ismailis and the Aga Khan
Imam of the Atomic Age: Aga Khan IV
Aga Khan IV: A Leader in Times of Crisis
Aga Khan’s Philanthropic Work
Following Prophet Muhammad’s death in 632 CE, Islam split over succession.
One group, later called Sunnis, believed leadership should go to qualified individuals, while another, the Shias, insisted it should remain within Muhammad’s bloodline.
This led to lasting differences in doctrine, law, and religious practices.
Major Shia Denominations
Shia Islam is not monolithic and has three main branches:
Twelver Shias (Ithna Ashariyah)
– The largest Shia sect, making up 90% of Shias, follows a line of 12 Imams. The 12th Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, is believed to be in occultation.
Ismaili Shias (Sevener Shias)
– They follow the same lineage as Twelvers until the sixth Imam, after which they diverge.
Zaydi Shias (Fiver Shias)
– They separate after the fourth Imam and have their distinct beliefs
The Ismaili branch of Shia Islam has two major subsects:
– Trace their lineage directly to the Aga Khans.
Dawoodi Bohras
– Recognize descent only up to the 18th Imam and follow a line of Dais, who are representatives of the hidden Imam.
Origins of the Aga Khan Title
The title of
Aga Khan was granted to Hasan Ali Shah, the 46th Imam of the Nizari Ismailis
, by Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, the king of Iran, in the 19th century.
Global Presence and Leadership
Nizari Ismailis are spread across 30+ countries, primarily tracing their roots to Persia and the Indian subcontinent.
They are not a majority community anywhere.
Lisbon as the Nizari Imamate’s Seat
In 2015, after an agreement with the Portuguese government,
Aga Khan IV declared Lisbon as the global headquarters of the Nizari Imamate
Born in 1936 in Geneva, Prince Karim was the eldest son of Prince Aly Khan and grandson of Aga Khan III.
Raised in Nairobi and Switzerland, he later pursued Islamic history at Harvard.
Succession to the Imamate
1957
, after the death of Aga Khan III,
Prince Karim was named his successor
, bypassing his father and uncle.
Aga Khan III justified this choice, stating that modern times required a young leader familiar with the new atomic age.
A Modern and Global Figure
Nicknamed the
“Imam of the Atomic Age”
, he symbolized progress and adaptability.
Bridged multiple divides
– spiritual and material, East and West, Muslim and Christian.
Despite his lavish lifestyle, he remained a guiding force for Nizari Ismailis.
Helped his community navigate major global shifts, including:
The end of the Cold War
Decolonization in Africa
The fall of communism in Central Asia
Ongoing conflicts in the Middle East
He believed an imam should engage with everyday life, not withdraw from it.
As he told Vanity Fair: “An imam is expected to protect his community and contribute to their quality of life.”

**********The Dual Realities of Indian Migration - Opportunity and Desperation
Context:
The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (January 9), the day that commemorates Mahatma Gandhi’s return to India from South Africa in 1915, successive PMs have called people of Indian origin (PIOs) and non-resident Indians (NRIs) as Mother India’s ambassadors.
However, the
plight of illegal Indian migrants returning from the U.S.
highlights another reality - one of economic desperation and limited opportunities.
Historical Context of Indian Migration:
Indian migration has deep historical roots, from
indentured labourers
during British rule to present-day emigrants seeking economic opportunities.
The Indian freedom movement opposed indentured labour, considering it
akin to slavery
The plight of today’s illegal migrants
mirrors the struggles faced by indentured labourers in colonial times.
They serve as a reminder to the world not of Indian genius, entrepreneurship, culture, or civilization, but rather of -
The lack of opportunities
The various forms of discrimination
, and
The unease of living in India
that forces them to endure the hardships of illegal migration.
Legal vs. Illegal Migration - A Stark Contrast:
Legal migrants are welcomed in developed nations due to their financial or intellectual capital.
Illegal migrants, with only their labour to offer, face hostility and are often deported.
Developed nations make a clear distinction between skilled professionals and economic refugees.
Current Trends in Illegal Migration:
Over 170,000 Indian migrants
have been detained by U.S. border authorities in the past five years.
A significant portion of illegal migrants hail from
Gujarat and Punjab
, states with a strong overseas presence.
Lack of employment opportunities
even in relatively developed states fuels illegal migration.
The Rising Trend of Wealthy Indians Emigrating:
Many affluent Indians are acquiring foreign citizenship through investment-based migration.
Over 6,500 wealthy Indians opted for paid emigration in 2022, while 4,300 did so in 2024.
Between 2011 and 2023
, nearly 18.8 lakh Indians renounced their citizenship.
Global Perspectives on Migration:
Historically, migration has been a
means to escape economic hardship
The U.S.
, which once welcomed Europe's poor and desperate,
is now restricting migration from developing nations.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump openly distinguished between
skilled and unskilled Indian migrants.
Challenges of Reintegration for Deportees:
Returning illegal migrants face
stigma
economic uncertainty
The Indian government and society must address their
reintegration and rehabilitation
While successful NRIs are celebrated, deported migrants are often
ignored or shamed
Conclusion:
, both legal and illegal, is
a complex issue
reflecting economic disparities.
As India celebrates its global achievers, it must also acknowledge and address the struggles of those who migrate out of desperation.
A holistic migration policy
is needed to balance opportunities at home with global mobility aspirations.

**********The Saga of Regulating India’s Thermal Power Emissions
Context
recent decision by India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
(MoEFCC) to extend
the deadline for thermal power plants to comply with sulphur dioxide (SO₂) emission
norms marks
yet another chapter in a protracted and complex policy struggle.
This move, which pushes the deadline back by three years without providing any justification,
exemplifies the bureaucratic inertia that has plagued India’s environmental regulatory landscape
for nearly a decade.
issue of SO₂ emission norms has transformed into a multifaceted debate
encompassing technological feasibility, cost implications, and governance inefficiencies.
continued delays raise serious concerns about environmental degradation, public health, and regulatory accountability.
The Origins and Evolution of SO₂ Emission Norms
India’s emission norms for thermal power plants
underwent a significant revision in December 2015.
MoEFCC, after public consultations, introduced stringent limits on particulate matter emissions
and, for the first time, formulated norms for SO₂ emissions.
These regulations were
aligned with international best practices
, comparable to those in Australia, China, and the United States.
Despite the ambitious scope of the new norms,
power plants were initially expected to comply by December 2017
, a timeline that was widely regarded as overly ambitious given India’s infrastructure and technological preparedness.
One would assume that
India’s relatively low-sulphur coal should have made compliance easier.
However,
the discussion around implementation quickly shifted
from a technical evaluation of suitable emission control
methods to a
narrow focus on flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) technology.
This transition, in turn
, led to concerns about high costs, long gestation periods, and supply chain limitations.
Rather than debating alternative approaches tailored to Indian conditions, the discourse became dominated by logistical and financial challenges.
Reason Behind Delays in India’s SO₂ Emission Compliance
Institutional Inertia and Fragmented Policy Discourse
As the debate progressed,
the issue became further complicated by conflicting viewpoints
from various government agencies.
Central Electricity Authority (CEA), in reports published in 2020 and 2021, questioned the feasibility of a uniform nationwide standard
and proposed extending full compliance until 2035.
CEA even commissioned a study from IIT Delhi
, which acknowledged the air quality benefits of FGDs but argued for a phased implementation due to cost concerns, increased coal consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.
Further muddying the waters,
in 2024, NITI Aayog sought an assessment from the CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute.
study challenged the very necessity of SO₂ emission norms
, suggesting that India should prioritise particulate matter emissions instead.
Such contradictory assessments,
coupled with the government’s reluctance to enforce compliance,
illustrate the lack of a cohesive, evidence-based approach
to environmental regulation.
Instead of building a scientific consensus
before rolling out the norms in 2015, the debate has persisted, causing regulatory uncertainty and repeated delays.
Repeated Extensions and Weak Enforcement
MoEFCC’s recent decision to extend the SO₂ compliance
marks the fourth such delay since the original norms were introduced.
As a result,
different deadlines now exist for different categories
of emissions and for thermal plants based on their location.
Paradoxically,
while compliance with particulate matter emission norms was mandated by December 2024 (with some plants required to comply as early as 2022 and 2023), there is little evidence
to suggest that
pollution control boards are actively verifying adherence
to these standards.
Inconsistent Enforcement
The fragmented and inconsistent enforcement of environmental regulations
raises fundamental questions about regulatory efficacy.
Without transparent monitoring and public accountability mechanisms,
it remains unclear whether thermal power plants are being held responsible for their emissions
or whether the latest extension is merely another step in a cycle of regulatory complacency.
The Economic and Public Health Costs of Delay
Economic Costs of Delay
From an economic standpoint,
the extension raises concerns about cost pass-through mechanisms in the electricity sector.
Recognising the financial burden of FGD installations,
regulators have allowed thermal plants to transfer these costs to electricity consumers.
This means that while plant operators are not financially penalised for non-compliance,
consumers bear the brunt of increased tariffs.
Adding to the irony,
even though some plants have already installed FGDs, they may choose not to operate them due to cost concerns.
Consequently,
consumers are paying for pollution control equipment that remains unused,
while residents near thermal plants continue to suffer from deteriorating air quality.
Environmental and Public Health Consequences
The environmental and public health consequences of this delay are severe.
SO₂ emissions contribute significantly to air pollution
, leading to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature mortality.
Prolonged exposure to high levels of SO₂ also results in the formation of secondary aerosols,
which worsen overall air quality.
Given that many of the affected thermal plants are situated near densely populated areas,
the failure to implement emission controls exacerbates the public health crisis, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations.
The Way Forward
Despite the clear environmental and health benefits of controlling SO₂ emissions,
regulatory dithering has allowed industry interests to prevail over public welfare.
The institutional inertia, financial loopholes, and governance failures associated with this issue suggest that
India’s environmental policy framework remains reactive rather than proactive.
If there is one lesson to be drawn
from this prolonged policy impasse,
it is that environmental regulations cannot be effective without consistent enforcement
and institutional commitment.
Conclusion
ongoing saga surrounding SO₂ emission compliance in India embodies the characteristics of a Kafkaesque bureaucratic ordeal
, characterised by endless delays, conflicting narratives, and a lack of accountability.
Merely setting ambitious targets
without ensuring their implementation
renders them meaningless.
Unless India’s regulatory bodies take decisive action, the country risks repeating this cycle of delay and dilution,
with grave consequences for both its citizens and its environment.

**********The Primary Lessons from the Reagan Air Crash
Context
mid-air collision between a United States Army Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines
CRJ-700 on January 29, 2025,
highlights critical human factors
that contribute to aviation disasters.
The accident, which claimed 67 lives
near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.,
is not an isolated incident.
It
reflects a pattern of systemic failures, including political interference, investigative opacity, miscommunication, and psychological biases
that affect decision-making in high-stress environments.
Political Interference in Aviation Investigations
One of the immediate reactions to the Reagan collision was
political blame-shifting by U.S. President Donald Trump.
He was
quick to attribute the tragedy to past administrations, blaming former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden for weakening air safety standards
, despite having been in office himself during the interim.
This
pattern of political opportunism is not new
. A similar instance was observed in India
following the Mangaluru air crash of 2010, where then Minister of Civil Aviation Praful Patel prematurely defended airport safety compliance
before an investigation had even begun.
Such
premature statements not only undermine investigative processes but also divert attention
from underlying issues that require systemic rectification.
opacity of aviation investigations in India further complicates accountability.
Unlike in countries where aviation data is accessible for public scrutiny,
Indian authorities often withhold digital flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder details,
sanitising reports to protect government agencies.
In contrast,
the Reagan collision demonstrated the value of transparency, as radar and air traffic control (ATC) recordings were publicly available
, allowing independent experts to analyse the event and provide accurate assessments.
Human Error and the ‘Hurry Syndrome’ in Aviation
The Reagan collision illustrates a critical human factor,
misidentification of aircraft during visual navigation.
helicopter pilot had reported visual confirmation of the American Airlines flight but may have mistaken it for another aircraft
on approach.
error was compounded by the limitations of nighttime visibility,
the stress of maintaining situational awareness, and the absence of an active collision avoidance system below 1,000 feet.
This phenomenon, known in aviation as “
Press-on-itis” or the “hurry syndrome,”
describes a cognitive fixation where pilots focus on a single goal while ignoring new inputs that contradict their assumptions.
A comparable incident occurred during the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision in 1996,
where a Kazakhstan Airlines aircraft failed to comply with ATC instructions,
leading to a tragic collision with a Saudi Arabian Boeing 747.
Investigations into that incident revealed
not only pilot error but also lapses in air traffic management.
pattern of dismissing systemic failures and placing sole blame on pilots persists in aviation investigations,
obscuring the broader institutional shortcomings
that contribute to such disasters.
Some Other Key Issues Raised by Reagan Collison
ATC Staffing Shortages and Systemic Oversights
Another significant issue raised by the Reagan collision was
the presence of only a single ATC controller at the time of the accident, instead of the usual two.
Overburdened ATC personnel are more likely to make critical errors
, increasing the risk of miscommunication or mismanagement of air traffic.
importance of adequate staffing and training for ATC personnel is underscored by past incidents,
including the near-miss of two IndiGo flights at Bengaluru airport in 2022.
In that case,
ATC controllers cleared both flights for simultaneous take-offs from parallel runways
, a major procedural lapse that was only discovered during a subsequent safety audit.
Regulatory Failures and ICAO Compliance Issues
Beyond individual human errors,
regulatory failures have contributed to unsafe conditions in aviation worldwide.
The December 2024 crash in South Korea
, where an aircraft landed with retracted landing gear and collided with a non-frangible instrument landing system antenna,
exemplifies negligence in adhering to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.
Despite ICAO’s mandate since 2010
that all airfield structures in operational areas must be frangible (i.e., designed to break on impact to reduce damage), South Korea
, like India in the Mangaluru crash, failed to comply.
Similarly,
Indian aviation regulators have a history of suppressing inconvenient findings.
Charkhi Dadri collision report, for instance, was finalised by an official different from the one who initially led the investigation.
Such interventions raise questions
about the integrity of aviation safety governance and the reliability of accident reports.
Media Sensationalism and Public Misconceptions
Public perception of aviation incidents is often shaped by media narratives
, which can either illuminate or distort the reality of an accident.
Following the Reagan collision,
Indian media revisited past accidents, including Charkhi Dadri, sometimes exaggerating details or omitting crucial factors.
The role of the media was also evident
in the case of an
Air India Express flight from Tiruchirappalli to Sharjah in October 2024.
captain’s decision to circle for three hours due to a hydraulic failure was portrayed as heroic,
despite aviation experts criticising the move as poor judgment.
When the media prioritises sensationalism over accuracy,
it misguides public discourse and influences policy decisions in ways that do not necessarily improve safety.
Conclusion
The Reagan mid-air collision serves as a stark reminder of the multifaceted issues in aviation safety,
ranging from human error and ATC mismanagement to political interference and regulatory failures.
The aviation industry must prioritise transparency, proper investigation protocols
, and adherence to ICAO standards to prevent such tragedies in the future.
Moreover,
a shift from blame-focused narratives to holistic safety improvements is essential.
The lessons from past accidents
, both in the U.S. and globally,
highlight that true progress in aviation safety can only be achieved through accountability,
systemic reforms, and a commitment to learning from each tragedy rather than merely assigning blame.

Enviro & Biodiversity
PYQ Relevance:
) Describe the benefits of deriving electric energy from sunlight in contrast to the conventional energy generation. What are the initiatives offered by our government for this purpose?
(UPSC CSE 2020)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
Environmental Impact Assessment studies (2015),
and
(2020).
On December 30, 2024, the MoEFCC extended the deadline for thermal plants to meet SO₂ emission norms by three years without explanation. Originally set for December 31, 2024, this delay affects 20 GW of plants near densely populated areas. These norms were set in 2015 to tighten particulate matter limits and introduced SO₂ norms for the first time, aligning them with standards in countries like Australia, China, and the U.S., despite the short timeline for compliance.
Today’s editorial talks about the
revised emission norms for Indian thermal plants
and impact of these norms. This content will help in GS Paper 3.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
On December 30, 2024, India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) changed the Environment Protection Rules, extending the deadline for thermal power plants to meet sulphur dioxide (SO₂) emission standards by three years without providing any explanation.
What are the revised emission norms for Indian thermal plants?
New Deadlines:
On December 30, 2024, India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) extended the deadlines for thermal power plants to comply with sulphur dioxide (SO₂) emission norms by three years. The revised deadlines are:
Category A (By Dec 31, 2027)
– Thermal plants within
10 km of NCR or cities with over 1 million population
(e.g., Dadri NTPC, Koradi) must comply first due to high pollution and population density.
Category B (By Dec 31, 2028)
– Plants in
critically polluted areas
non-attainment cities
(e.g., Singrauli, Korba, Chandrapur) get extended timelines due to severe environmental concerns.
Category C (By Dec 31, 2029)
– All
other plants
(e.g., Talcher, Mundra, Simhadri) must comply last as they are in lower-risk areas with relatively better air quality.
Historical Context:
The original norms were established in December 2015, with an initial compliance deadline set for December 2017. This was later extended multiple times due to various challenges.
Note:
categories for compliance with SO₂ emission norms
for Indian thermal power plants are based on location and environmental impact.
What are the challenges around implementing the flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) technology?
Technical and Financial Hurdles:
The implementation of FGD technology has faced delays primarily due to high costs, inadequate supply chains, and operational complexities. Many plants tendered contracts for FGDs but did not progress at a pace necessary to meet earlier deadlines.
Debate on Necessity:
Recent studies commissioned by NITI Aayog and conducted by CSIR-NEERI have questioned the urgency and necessity of FGD installations for improving air quality, suggesting that focus should instead be on particulate emissions. This has led to confusion and varied interpretations of compliance requirements among stakeholders.
How successful has India been in implementing emission norms for thermal power plants?
Limited Progress:
As of late 2024, only about 22 GW of thermal capacity had installed FGDs, which is less than 8% of the total coal-fired power generation capacity in India. The overall progress has been slower than anticipated since the introduction of the norms.
Compliance Monitoring Issues:
There is a lack of transparency regarding adherence to existing norms, as pollution control boards have not consistently verified compliance. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of regulatory oversight.
What are the economic and environmental consequences of noncompliance and what measures are in place to address this?
Health Impacts:
The extension of compliance deadlines poses risks to public health, especially in densely populated areas like Delhi-NCR, where air pollution is already a critical issue. SO₂ is known to contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
Financial Burden on Consumers:
Electricity regulators have allowed thermal plants to pass on the costs of installing FGDs to consumers, regardless of whether emission norms are met. This means consumers may end up paying for pollution control equipment that remains unused due to extended compliance timelines.
Environmental Compensation:
For non-compliance beyond specified timelines, MoEFCC has introduced an environmental compensation scheme that penalizes plants based on their duration of non-compliance. This includes fees that escalate over time but may not be sufficient to incentivize timely compliance.
Way forward:
Strict Enforcement & Incentives
– Strengthen regulatory oversight with real-time emissions monitoring, enforce penalties for non-compliance, and provide financial incentives or subsidies to accelerate FGD adoption.
Balanced Policy Approach
– Address technical and financial barriers by improving supply chains, supporting domestic FGD manufacturing, and ensuring a phased yet firm transition while prioritising high-risk areas.
**********Bhopal’s new order criminalising begging
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to welfare;
Why in the News?
Recently, the Bhopal district collector banned begging in the district and imposed strict rules, including filing police cases against both those who beg and those who give alms.
What legal basis is Bhopal using to criminalize begging?
Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023:
The orders by the collectors of Indore and Bhopal are under this section, which empowers officials like the District Magistrate or any Executive Magistrate to issue orders in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger. This order can direct any person to abstain from a certain act and may apply to residents or the public frequenting a particular area.
Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS):
Action will be taken under this section, which punishes those disobeying an order announced by a public servant lawfully empowered to do so.
What are the penalties for violating the order?
Disobedience of the order can result in simple imprisonment for up to six months, a fine of up to Rs 2500, or both.
If the disobedience causes or tends to cause danger to human life, health, or safety, imprisonment can extend to one year, and the fine to Rs 5000.
How have different regions in India approached the issue?
Bombay Prevention of Beggary Act, 1959:
The first law against begging, with colonial roots, aimed to clear streets of destitute persons, leprosy patients, or those with mental illnesses by sending them to institutions. Mumbai still has detention centres under this Act, allowing police to detain those without visible means of subsistence, with punishment extending to detention for 10 years.
Delhi High Court (2018)
Struck down some sections of the Bombay Prevention of Beggary Act as unconstitutional, decriminalizing begging in Delhi. The court stated that people beg out of need, as a last resort for survival, and the government has a mandate to provide social security
Other States
Many states, including Maharashtra, continue to criminalise begging under the Bombay Prevention of Beggary Act. There is no central act on begging, but many states have enacted their own laws based on the 1959 Act.
Rehabilitation Efforts In 2020
: the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment proposed focusing on rehabilitation rather than criminalising begging in ten cities, including Mumbai
State-Level Criminalization
: Around 22 states and union territories have anti-begging laws, many modeled after the
Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959
, which criminalizes begging, vagrancy, and soliciting alms, allowing arrest without a warrant.
States like Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and others have enacted similar laws.
Decriminalization Efforts & Judicial Interventions
: The
struck down parts of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act as unconstitutional, decriminalizing begging in Delhi. The
Supreme Court (2021)
also refused to ban begging nationwide, recognizing that criminalizing it unfairly targets the poor. Rajasthan has taken a more rehabilitative approach.
What are the arguments for and against criminalizing begging?
Arguments in favour:
Curbing Organized Begging Rackets
– Criminalization helps tackle
forced begging
, where vulnerable individuals, including children and disabled people, are exploited by criminal networks.
Public Safety and Order
– Authorities argue that begging creates
, disrupts traffic, and can lead to petty crimes, making public spaces unsafe.
Encouraging Rehabilitation
– Some laws claim to
detain beggars for rehabilitation
, ensuring they receive food, shelter, and vocational training instead of relying on alms.
Argument against:
Violation of Fundamental Rights
– Criminalizing begging punishes
poverty, not crime
, violating the
right to life (Article 21)
by penalizing individuals who have no means of survival.
State’s Failure in Social Security
– The presence of beggars
reflects gaps in government welfare
, and punishing them shifts the burden away from state accountability.
Arbitrary and Unjust Implementation
– Many laws
allow arrests without warrants
, disproportionately targeting the homeless, disabled, and elderly, rather than addressing systemic issues.
Way forward:
Rehabilitation-Centered Approach
– Shift focus from criminalization to
social welfare programs
, including skill development, housing, mental health support, and reintegration into society.
Legislative Reforms & Judicial Oversight
– Enact a
uniform national policy
that prioritizes
rehabilitation over punishment
, while ensuring judicial oversight to prevent misuse of anti-begging laws.
Mains question for practice:
Q
Critically examine the rationale behind criminalizing begging in India. Discuss the legal and constitutional challenges associated with such measures.

**********Rajasthan’s Bill against ‘unlawful’ religious conversions
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Unlawful conversion; Fundamental Rights;
Why in the News?
Recently, the bill was introduced in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly to prevent “unlawful” religious conversions.
What are the Draft Provisions under the Bill?
Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion
– The Bill bans religious conversions through misrepresentation, force, coercion, allurement, fraud, or marriage.
Declaration & Inquiry for Voluntary Conversion
– Individuals must submit a declaration to the District Magistrate (DM) 60 days in advance, with authorities conducting an inquiry to verify the intent.
Burden of Proof & FIR Filing
– The person facilitating the conversion must prove it was voluntary, and an FIR can be filed by the affected individual or close relatives.
Punishments & Penalties
– General unlawful conversion leads to 1-5 years of imprisonment, increasing to 2-10 years for minors, women, or SC/ST individuals; mass conversions attract 3-10 years in jail.
Legal Consequences & Compensation
– Marriages done solely for unlawful conversion are invalid, the offense is non-bailable, and courts may award compensation up to ₹5 lakh to victims.
What about those wanting to convert voluntarily?
Those wanting to convert voluntarily would undergo a detailed process. A prescribed declaration form must be filled out and submitted to the
District Magistrate (DM) or the relevant authority 60 days
in advance and violations invite up to
three years’ punishment and a minimum fine of Rs 10,000.
The person performing the conversion ceremony would give a month’s advance notice to the DM via a prescribed form, and violating this would invite up to five years’ imprisonment and a
minimum fine of Rs 25,000.
An officer not below the rank of Additional DM will conduct a police inquiry regarding the real intention, purpose, and cause of the proposed religious conversion.
The converted person must send a declaration in a prescribed form
within 60 days of conversion to the DM,
including details such as date of birth, address, and religion before and after conversion. The convert has to
appear before the DM within 21 days
from the date of filing the declaration to establish their identity and confirm the contents of the declaration.
Were attempts made to pass such a Bill earlier?
2006:
BJP-led government under Vasundhara Raje introduced the Rajasthan Freedom of Religion Bill, 2006, to curb “forced” conversions.
2008:
Amended version required prior approval from the District Collector but was stuck with the Centre.
2013-2018:
Raje’s second tenure saw efforts to revive the 2008 Bill, but the Centre rejected it in 2017, citing deviation from national policy.
2017:
Rajasthan High Court issued guidelines to prevent forced conversions in the absence of a law.
2025:
The current Bill is seen as a successor to these previous attempts and is expected to pass in the budget session.
What would be the impact on Fundamental Rights?
Right to Freedom of Religion (Article 25)
– Every individual has the right to freely
profess, practice, and propagate
religion. However, the Bill imposes
state scrutiny
on religious conversions, which may be seen as a restriction on this right.
Right to Privacy (Article 21)
– The requirement of
mandatory declaration
to the District Magistrate and police inquiry into personal religious choices could infringe upon the
right to privacy
, recognized as a fundamental right in the
Puttaswamy judgment (2017)
Burden of Proof Issue
– Placing the burden of proof on the person facilitating the conversion contradicts the legal principle of
“innocent until proven guilty”
, potentially violating
Article 14 (Right to Equality)
Criminalization and Fear
– The stringent punishments and
criminalization of conversion through marriage
might discourage individuals from exercising their right to choose their faith or marry interfaith partners, potentially violating their
personal liberty (Article 21)
Way forward:
Ensure Constitutional Safeguards
– Amend the Bill to align with
by distinguishing
forced conversions from voluntary ones
, reducing state overreach in personal religious choices, and upholding the
right to privacy (Article 21)
Fair Implementation & Oversight
– Establish
independent judicial review
for conversion inquiries to prevent misuse, ensure
burden of proof remains balanced
, and introduce
strict safeguards against harassment
of individuals exercising their religious freedom.
Mains PYQ:
Examine the scope of Fundamental Rights in the light of the latest judgement of the Supreme Court on Right to Privacy.

**********India studying US memo on ‘modifying’ sanctions waiver for Chabahar Port
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India-USA relation;
Why in the News?
A day after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order that might lead to sanctions on India for investing in Iran’s Chabahar port, the Indian government did not comment on the order or its impact.
How will the potential modification by the US impact India’s Chabahar Port project?
Increased Uncertainty
: The potential withdrawal or modification of the U.S. waiver could put India’s long-term investment and operations at Chabahar at risk.
Disruptions in Operations
: If U.S. sanctions extend to businesses involved in shipping, insurance, and logistics, Indian firms operating at Chabahar may face compliance challenges.
Delays in Expansion Plans
: India’s plans to integrate Chabahar into the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and use it for trade with Russia and Central Asia may be significantly slowed.
Strategic Setback
: Chabahar serves as a counterbalance to Pakistan’s Gwadar port (developed by China). Any disruption could weaken India’s strategic positioning in the region.
What are the significance of the Chabahar Port project?
Strategic and Geopolitical Importance
: Provides India a trade route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan, and counters China’s influence at Gwadar Port under CPEC.
Economic and Trade Connectivity
: Acts as a key link in the
, enhancing India’s trade with Iran, Russia, and Central Asia.
Humanitarian and Security Role
: Facilitates aid delivery to Afghanistan, strengthens India-Iran ties, and enhances India’s presence in the Indian Ocean region for maritime security.
What will be the implications for India’s connectivity to Eurasia and Afghanistan?
Disruption in Trade Routes
: Chabahar is India’s key route for accessing Afghanistan and Central Asia while bypassing Pakistan. U.S. sanctions could make trade difficult, impacting economic ties with these regions.
Humanitarian Concerns
: The port has been critical in facilitating food and medical aid to Afghanistan. New restrictions could hamper India’s ability to provide humanitarian assistance.
Geopolitical Recalibration
: If access to Chabahar becomes restricted, India may need to explore alternative routes, potentially shifting focus towards Russia and Central Asia via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port or strengthening ties with the Taliban for land-based transit through Afghanistan.
How will India and the US address this issue in their bilateral conversations? (Way forward)
Diplomatic Negotiations
: India is expected to lobby the U.S. for a continued waiver by emphasizing Chabahar’s role in humanitarian aid and regional stability.
Strategic Arguments
: New Delhi could argue that Chabahar helps counterbalance China’s influence (via Gwadar and the Belt and Road Initiative) and aids the U.S. interest in regional connectivity.
Possible Compromise
: India might propose limiting Chabahar’s use for trade with Afghanistan while finding alternative routes for trade with Russia and Central Asia to align with U.S. geopolitical concerns.
Bilateral Trade-Offs
: India may leverage its growing defense and economic partnerships with the U.S. to seek exemptions, similar to the earlier waiver granted under the Trump administration.

of energy, equivalent to multiple nuclear explosions.
It injured
1,500 people
and damaged thousands of buildings across several cities.
In comparison, the
Apophis asteroid
, discovered in 2004, was initially rated
but was later downgraded after further observations ruled out an impact threat.
How often do Asteroids crash Into Earth?
Thousands of
small asteroids
burn up in Earth’s atmosphere
daily
due to friction.
Chelyabinsk meteor (2013)
exploded over Russia with
30 times
the power of the Hiroshima bomb.
Asteroids around 40 meters
can cause
regional destruction
if they hit Earth.
Large asteroids (1 km+ in size)
can trigger
global disasters
, occurring about
once every 260 million years
Chicxulub asteroid (66 million years ago)
led to the
extinction of dinosaurs
How Space Agencies prevent Asteroid Collisions?
NASA and global space agencies
work on
planetary defense
to prevent impacts.
2022, NASA’s DART mission
successfully
changed asteroid
Dimorphos’s
trajectory
using kinetic impact.
Scientists explore
3 key methods
for asteroid deflection:
Kinetic Impact:
Using spacecraft to hit an asteroid and alter its path.
Gravity Tractors:
Using a spacecraft’s gravity to pull an asteroid off course.
Nuclear Explosions:
As a last resort, detonating a nuclear device near an asteroid to deflect or destroy it.
