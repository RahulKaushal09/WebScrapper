**********Holocene Epoch
Rates of relative sea-level rise during the final stage of the last deglaciation, the early Holocene, are key to understanding future ice melt and sea-level change under a warming climate.
About Holocene Epoch:
It is the
current period of geologic time.
The term was introduced by Gervais in 1869 and was accepted as part of valid geological nomenclature by the International Geological Congress in 1885.
Another term
that is sometimes used is the
Anthropocene Epoch
because its primary
characteristic is the global changes caused by human activity.
The Holocene Epoch
began 12,000 to 11,500 years ago
at the
close of the Paleolithic Ice Age
continues through today.
It is marked by a
significant warming trend
relative climate stability
compared to the previous glacial period.
sediments
of the Holocene, both continental and marine,
cover the largest area of the globe of any epoch
in the geologic record, but the Holocene is unique because it
coincides with the late and post-Stone Age history of humankind.
Among interglacial periods, the Holocene is unique as the period in which
more complex human civilisations and agriculture developed.

**********Corbett Tiger Reserve
The Supreme Court recently pulled up the Uttarakhand government for moving at a "snail's pace" against its senior officers accused of illegal constructions in Corbett Tiger Reserve.
About Corbett Tiger Reserve:
It is located on the
foothills of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand.
Establishment:
Corbett was the
first national park of India
, established in 1936. It was
named Hailey National Park then.
In 1957, the park was rechristened Corbett National Park in memory of the late Jim Corbett, a great naturalist and eminent conservationist.
After the addition of areas to the originally declared National Park, the total area of Tiger Reserve extends to 1288.31 sq. km.
The terrain is undulating with several valleys. The
rivers Ramganga, Pallaen, and Sonanadi
flow through the valleys.
By and large, the reserve is spread over the
Bhabar and lower Shivalik regions
with a deep-water table.
The tract is porous with boulders and sand deposits.
Flora:
In general, the vegetation comprises
sal and mixed forests,
interspersed with
grass lands and riparian vegetation.
grasslands are locally known as ‘Chaur
’, which are an
outcome of abandoned settlements
or past clearings.
Evergreen Sal and its combined trees, the Sheesham, and the Kanju are found extensively on the ridges.
One plant, (actually a weed),
which is a
major irritant
to the reserve authorities and is widespread in the jungle, is the
Lantana
Fauna
Tigers and elephants
are the charismatic mammals, besides a large array of co-predators (
leopards
, small carnivores), ungulates (s
ambar, hog deer,
spotted deer), birds, reptiles (gharials, crocodile), and fishes.

**********GPS Spoofing
As many as 465 GPS interference and spoofing incidents have been reported in the border region, mostly in the Amritsar and Jammu areas, between November 2023 and February 2025, the government said recently.
What is a Spoofing Attack?
A “spoofing attack” is a broad category of
cyberattack
where
fake data
disguised as originating from a trusted source to deceive systems
or users.
Kinds of spoofing include
GPS Spoofing, IP spoofing
—often used to avoid detection while performing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)—as well as
SMS spoofing
caller ID spoofing
, where messages or calls appear to be from another number or caller ID.
About GPS Spoofing:
GPS spoofing uses
bogus radio signals to imitate legitimate
Global Positioning System
(GPS) signal
misdirecting GPS-receiving devices about their actual location
This can
result in incorrect navigation data
and potentially l
ife-threatening situations,
especially in systems that rely heavily on precise location information.
How GPS Spoofing Works?
exploits
inherent vulnerabilities in the GPS infrastructure
– the
weak signal strength of GPS satellites.
The GPS functions by sending signals from satellites to GPS receivers on Earth.
These receivers then calculate their position based on the time it takes for these signals to arrive.
However, due to the weak signal strength of the GPS satellites,
these signals can be easily overwhelmed by fake signals,
resulting in inaccurate location data on the receiving device.
Typically, a GPS spoofer begins by acquiring a basic understanding of the victim’s GPS setup, including the types of signals it uses and how they are processed.
With that information, the
attacker then sends counterfeit GPS signals
that mimic the real ones.
fake signals are stronger
causing the receiver to recognize them as authentic
As a result, the victim’s GPS receiver ends up processing these counterfeit signals, leading to erroneous location information.

**********India’s Habitual Offender Laws: A Legacy of Discrimination
Why in the News?
Recently, the Government of India has revealed in Parliament that laws which declare a section of criminals as “habitual offenders” continue to operate in as many as 14 States and Union Territories.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Habitual Offenders (Laws, Historical Roots, SC’s Observation, Impact on DNTs, Present Status, etc.)
Habitual offender laws in India allow state authorities to identify and monitor individuals convicted of certain crimes repeatedly.
These laws were intended to control repeat offenders, but have come under heavy criticism for
institutionalising discrimination
, especially against
denotified, nomadic, and semi-nomadic tribes (DNT, NT, SNT).
These communities have historically been labelled as "criminal tribes" during British rule.
As of March 2025, the Government of India confirmed in Parliament that such laws continue to operate in
, despite the
Supreme Court's recent observations
questioning their constitutional validity and discriminatory application.
Historical Roots: From Criminal Tribes to Habitual Offenders:
The origins of these laws date back to
colonial legislation
Regulation XXII (1793)
granted magistrates power to imprison or force labour on certain communities based merely on suspicion.
This evolved into the
Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) of 1871
, which allowed the British to declare
entire communities as “criminal by birth”
The CTA was extended in 1924 to cover all of colonial India.
Post-independence, following the
Criminal Tribes Enquiry Committee Report (1949-50)
, the CTA was repealed in
1952
, and communities previously criminalised were officially
However, states soon introduced
Habitual Offender Acts
, which, while framed around individual behaviour, continued to disproportionately target DNTs.
Supreme Court’s Intervention and Recent Developments:
October 2024
, the Supreme Court expressed concern over the habitual offender classification while addressing caste-based discrimination in jails.
The bench, led by then-Chief Justice
D.Y. Chandrachud
, highlighted that:
“A whole community ought not to have either been declared a criminal tribe in the past or a habitual offender in the present.”
The court “urged” states to review the relevance and application of these laws, especially when they appear to be
tools for profiling entire communities
Crimes Under the Habitual Offender Tag:
State laws define habitual offenders based on prior
convictions for specific offences
, including:
“Being a thug”
“Belonging to a gang of dacoits”
“Living on the earnings of prostitution”
Various forms of “lurking”
These laws typically involve maintaining
registers of such offenders
, which continue to echo the registration practices under the CTA.
In states like Rajasthan, prison manuals even
explicitly link habitual offender status to denotified communities
Impact on Denotified and Nomadic Tribes:
Despite formal denotification,
remain vulnerable to police surveillance, social ostracization, and
systematic exclusion
In 1998, the
custodial death of Budhan Sabar
, a member of a denotified tribe, sparked national outrage and gave rise to the
Denotified and Nomadic Tribes Rights Action Group (DNT-RAG)
Several activists worked to document the injustice, prompting action from the
NHRC
, and later, the
United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
, which called for repeal of these laws in
2007
Several reports, including the
B.S. Renke Commission (2008)
and the
Xaxa Committee (2014)
, have emphasized how the
stigma of criminality persists
, further marginalising DNTs from education, employment, and social integration.
Current Status Across States:
Reactions from states to the Supreme Court’s observation have been mixed:
Punjab
Odisha
report no active use of the law in recent years.
Andhra Pradesh
has no inmates under the law currently.
Gujarat
Goa
support retaining the law, claiming it is not used to target DNTs.
Uttar Pradesh
subsumed these provisions under its
Goondas Act
Delhi
leads in application: as per
NCRB 2022
21.5%
of its convicts were classified as habitual offenders,
the highest in the country
Importance of Repeal:
Critics argue that the habitual offender laws:
Perpetuate colonial-era stigma
and discrimination.
Enable
targeted policing
of marginalised communities.
Violate
fundamental rights
, including equality (Article 14) and freedom of movement (Article 19).
Contradict India's commitments to
racial and caste-based non-discrimination
under international human rights law.
uniform repeal
across all states would be a
long-overdue step
toward justice and inclusion for DNT, NT, and SNT communities.
Conclusion:
may appear neutral on paper, but their
colonial legacy and discriminatory enforcement
have made them tools of oppression against vulnerable communities.
With growing judicial scrutiny and consistent recommendations from rights commissions, the time has come for a
nationwide review and repeal
of these outdated laws.
Empowering denotified and nomadic tribes requires not just policy reforms, but a
conscious dismantling of inherited prejudices
, starting with the
removal of systemic legal discrimination

**********World Happiness Report 2025 - India’s Happiness Ranking Improves but Still Trails Pakistan
Why in News?
The World Happiness Report 2025, published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the
University of Oxford
, ranks
Finland
as the happiest country for the
eighth consecutive year
.
It highlights
an improvement in India’s happiness score and ranking
over the past three years. However, despite its economic and governance advantages, India continues to lag behind Pakistan in overall happiness rankings.
The rankings are based on Gallup surveys and the
UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Methodology of the World Happiness Report
Key Highlights of the World Happiness Report 2025
India’s Ranking and Performance
Discrepancies in India’s Rankings
Conclusion
Methodology of the World Happiness Report:
Life evaluations:
Based on responses from the Gallup World Poll, where people rate their life on a 0-10 scale using the Cantril Ladder method.
Three-year average:
The 2025 rankings are based on data collected from 2022 to 2024.
Key indicators considered:
While the rankings are not based on an index,
six primary factors
influence happiness scores:
GDP per capita
Healthy life expectancy
Social support
Perceived freedom to make life choices
Generosity
Perception of corruption
Key Highlights of the World Happiness Report 2025:
Top-ranked countries:
Nordic dominance:
Finland, Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden occupy the top four positions.
New entrants in top 10:
Costa Rica (6th) and Mexico (10th) made it to the top ten for the first time.
Israel (8th):
Despite the ongoing war with Hamas, Israel secured a high position in the rankings.
Determinants of happiness:
Beyond
economic growth, trust, social connections, and support networks
play a crucial role in happiness.
Household size:
In Mexico and Europe, families with four to five members report the highest happiness levels.
Belief in kindness:
Trust in strangers returning a lost wallet strongly correlates with national happiness.
Declining happiness in the west:
United States (24th):
Dropped from 11th (2012) due to increased
isolation
, with a 53% rise in people dining alone over two decades.
United Kingdom (23rd):
Lowest happiness level since 2017.
Least happy countries:
Afghanistan:
Continues to be the unhappiest, with Afghan women facing extreme hardship.
Sierra Leone and Lebanon
ranked second and third lowest.
Global social support decline:
19% of young adults reported having no one to rely on.
India’s Ranking and Performance:
Improved ranking:
India moved up from 126th (out of 143 countries last year) to
118th
(out of 147 countries).
Score increase:
India’s happiness score rose from 4.054 to 4.389 (on a scale of 10).
Sub-indicators:
57th for donations.
10th for volunteering.
74th for helping a stranger.
Wallet return probability: 115th (by neighbor), 86th (by stranger), 93rd (by police).
Comparison with neighbors:
India ranked
below Nepal, Pakistan (109th), Ukraine, and Palestine
in overall happiness.
Discrepancies in India’s Rankings:
Lower ranking than Pakistan:
Despite India’s superior economic and governance indicators, it ranks lower than Pakistan in happiness.
Economic strength:
India’s per capita income ($2,480.8 in 2023) is significantly higher than Pakistan’s ($1,365.3).
Health indicators:
India’s healthy life expectancy (58.1 years in 2021) is slightly better than Pakistan’s (56.9 years).
Corruption perception:
India ranked 96th in the Corruption Perceptions Index 2024, much better than Pakistan (135th).
Conclusion:
India’s improvement in happiness ranking signals progress, but the
methodology of the report raises concerns
as it does not fully account for economic strength, health, and governance. The rankings suggest that
social factors, trust, and well-being perceptions
play a larger role in determining happiness than material prosperity alone.
According to Gallup CEO (Jon Clifton),
happiness isn't just about wealth or growth
- it's about trust, connection, and knowing people have your back.
Investing in one another is essential
if we want stronger economies and communities.

**********The Assault on Multilateralism and International Law
Context
Despite criticisms
regarding its effectiveness and bureaucratic inefficiencies,
the UN remains the most significant global organisation
dedicated to multilateral diplomacy.
However,
the introduction of the Disengaging Entirely from the United Nations Debacle (DEFUND) Act
by U.S. Senator Mike Lee
threatens to undermine the UN’s legitimacy
and functionality by proposing a complete U.S. withdrawal.
Such a move would have far-reaching consequences,
not only for the UN but also for global governance as a whole.
The Threat to the United Nations
Legal and Institutional Implications of the DEFUND Act
If passed,
the DEFUND Act would sever the U.S.'s relationship with the UN
by repealing fundamental legislation, including the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 and the United Nations Headquarters Agreement of 1947.
These laws are crucial because they legally formalise U.S. participation in the UN
and establish its obligations, including financial contributions and diplomatic support.
Their repeal would mean the U.S. would no longer be bound by its commitments to the UN,
effectively nullifying its role within the organization.
Furthermore, the DEFUND Act seeks to
halt all financial contributions
to the UN.
The U.S. is historically the largest contributor to the UN’s budget
, providing approximately 22% of the UN’s core funding and 28% of the peacekeeping budget.
Cutting this funding would
significantly impact UN programs
related to peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, development, and health initiatives.
U.S. withdrawal could lead to funding shortages
, weakening the UN’s ability to respond to global crises.
Diplomatic and Geopolitical Consequences
Beyond financial concerns,
the DEFUND Act would have profound diplomatic and geopolitical implications.
U.S. has historically played a leading role in shaping UN policies
, influencing major international decisions, and using its permanent seat on the UN Security Council (UNSC) to assert its foreign policy interests.
withdrawal would mean relinquishing this influence
, creating a power vacuum that could be filled by rival nations, particularly China and Russia.
These countries have already been expanding their influence within UN agencies
, and a diminished U.S. presence could further tilt the balance of power in their favour.
Additionally, withdrawing from the UN could
isolate the U.S. diplomatically
While other global powers continue to engage in multilateral discussions
on issues such as climate change, nuclear non-proliferation, and human rights,
the U.S. would be left without a seat at the table.
This
could weaken its ability to negotiate international agreements
and influence global policies, ultimately reducing its strategic leverage on the world stage.
Impact on UN Operations and Peacekeeping Missions
One of the most critical areas
that would suffer from a U.S. withdrawal is
UN peacekeeping operations.
U.S. has been a key supporter of peacekeeping missions
, providing funding, logistical support, and personnel training.
If the DEFUND Act passes, it would prohibit U.S. participation in these operations, leading to operational difficulties for UN missions
in conflict zones such as South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and Mali.
The Shift Towards Economic Nationalism and the Consequence of Unilateralism
The Trump administration’s economic policies also reflected
a departure from multilateralism.
The implementation of aggressive tariffs under the guise of national security drew parallels to the protectionist policies of the 1930s,
particularly the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.
That historical period saw a rise in trade barriers
, contributing to economic instability and the onset of World War II.
In contrast,
the post-war global economy was built on the principles of free trade,
culminating in the establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, which later evolved into the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
the U.S. under Trump actively undermined the WTO by blocking appointments to its Appellate Body
, which resolves trade disputes.
obstructionism has pushed the WTO into a state of crisis
, jeopardizing the global trade system that has ensured economic stability for decades.
The Consequences of Unilateralism
The broader implications of these actions are clear:
the erosion of multilateral institutions threatens global governance, economic stability, and international law.
The Trump administration’s rejection of international cooperation in areas such as climate change, public health, and human rights has
created a leadership vacuum.
The weakening of institutions like the UN, ICC, and WTO undermines collective efforts to address pressing global challenges,
making it more difficult to coordinate responses to crises such as pandemics and climate change.
Furthermore, the U.S.’s retreat from multilateralism has
sparked concerns about retaliation from other nations.
idea of "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) is fundamentally at odds with the reality
that global leadership requires cooperation, not isolation.
Without strong international alliances, the U.S. risks
diminishing its influence and facing economic repercussions
A New Opportunity for Global Leadership
Amidst the U.S.'s retreat,
non-Western nations,
particularly India, have an opportunity to assume a greater role in global governance.
India has consistently advocated for
and adherence to international law.
During the G-20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting
in February 2025, India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar reaffirmed the importance of an inclusive approach to global challenges,
emphasising the need for peaceful resolutions and international cooperation.
the current geopolitical climate presents an opportunity for India to push for long-overdue reforms
in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
As a rising global power,
India has been advocating for a more representative and democratic UNSC structure.
With the U.S. withdrawing from its leadership role,
emerging economies like India can step up to shape the future of global governance.
Conclusion
‘America First’ approach, characterized by economic nationalism and political isolationism, has significantly weakened the multilateral institutions
that uphold international law and global stability.
The potential withdrawal from the UN, sanctions on the ICC, and
obstruction of the WTO signal a shift towards unilateralism that threatens the global order.
While these actions may
temporarily serve U.S. nationalist interests, they ultimately undermine long-term global cooperation and stability.

Editorial Analysis
**********The Challenge of Policing Digital Giants
Context
In the digital age,
data has become a powerful tool for market dominance
, leading to concerns over monopolistic practices by technology giants.
recent order by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) against Meta underscores the increasing scrutiny
over data exploitation and anti-competitive behaviour in digital markets.
Now it becomes imperative to explore the significance of the CCI’s decision,
its broader implications in the global regulatory landscape, and the need for India to update its competition
laws to address data-driven monopolies effectively.
An Overview of The CCI’s Order Against Meta
On November 18, 2024, the CCI imposed
a fine of ₹213.14 crore on Meta and introduced a five-year ban on sharing WhatsApp user data
with other Meta-owned platforms such as Facebook and Instagram for advertising purposes.
order was based on the finding that WhatsApp’s 2021 privacy policy update
constituted an abuse of its dominant position in the markets for Over-The-Top (OTT) messaging services and online display advertising.
policy mandated users to consent to data-sharing on a “take-it-or-leave-it” basis
, reinforcing Meta’s market power and limiting competition.
Meta appealed the decision to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT),
which granted a stay on the ban and the penalty on January 23, 2025, provided Meta deposited 50% of the penalty.
This
legal battle highlights the growing challenge of regulating tech giants
that leverage data to consolidate their market dominance.
The Role of Data in Digital Market Dominance
Data has become the
backbone of the modern digital economy
, often likened to oil but with an even greater utility.
Unlike finite resources,
data can be collected, analysed, and reused indefinitely,
providing immense competitive advantages.
Meta, for instance, leverages its vast user data to refine algorithms,
enable hyper-targeted advertising, and create personalized experiences.
data-driven dominance fosters network effects, where more users generate
more data, further strengthening a platform’s market position and deterring new competitors.
Google’s case in India further illustrates this trend.
In 2022, the CCI fined Google ₹1,337.76 crore for abusing its dominance in multiple markets, including mobile operating systems and app stores.
Google was penalised for mandating the pre-installation of its apps on Android devices
, a practice that was upheld by the NCLAT in 2023.
These
cases highlight how dominant players use their control over digital infrastructure
to entrench their positions, making regulatory intervention crucial.
Global Regulatory Efforts to Curb Tech Monopolies
United States: Antitrust Investigations and Lawsuits
Meta (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp)
In 2020, the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an antitrust lawsuit against Meta
, accusing it of engaging in anti-competitive practices by acquiring Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014) to eliminate competition.
The lawsuit argues that Meta’s acquisitions were not aimed at enhancing its services
but rather at stifling emerging competitors in the social media and messaging markets.
FTC has sought a breakup of Meta’s business
to restore competitive conditions.
Google's Legal Challenges
In 2024,
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found Google guilty of violating the Sherman Act
, the key U.S. antitrust law, due to its exclusive agreements in the search and online advertising markets.
Google has been sued for monopolising the digital advertising market
by acquiring competitors, forcing advertisers to use its ad services, and limiting the interoperability of rival advertising platforms.
U.S. government has sought structural remedies
, including breaking up parts of Google’s ad business to restore fair competition.
These legal actions represent a shift in the U.S. regulatory stance
, which for years had been lenient toward digital monopolies.
With bipartisan support,
there is a growing push for stricter oversight and legislative reforms to update antitrust laws for the digital age.
European Union: A Pioneering Approach to Digital Regulation
Digital Markets Act (DMA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Digital Markets Act (DMA), which came into effect in 2023, identifies ‘gatekeepers’
, large digital platforms like Meta, Google, and Amazon, that must comply with specific rules to prevent anti-competitive behaviour.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), introduced in 2018, has set a global precedent
for data protection by enforcing strict consent requirements and penalising unauthorised data usage.
DMA mandates interoperability between messaging apps, prohibits self-preferencing (such as Google favouring its own search results over competitors),
and requires companies to provide users with more control over their data.
Meta’s Facebook-Germany Case
In 2019,
Germany’s Bundeskartellamt (Federal Cartel Office) found Meta guilty of abusing its dominant position
by combining user data from various platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) without explicit user consent.
decision forced Meta to allow users to opt out of data merging across its platforms,
setting a precedent for regulating data monopolization as an anti-competitive practice.
Google’s €8 Billion Antitrust Penalties
Over the past decade,
Google has faced multiple fines in the EU for anti-competitive practices, totalling over €8 billion.
The European Commission imposed three major fines on Google.
2.42 billion (2017) for manipulating search results
to favour its shopping service.
€4.34 billion (2018) for forcing smartphone
manufacturers to pre-install Google apps on Android devices.
€1.49 billion (2019) for anti-competitive
advertising practices in online search advertising.
The EU’s approach to regulating digital monopolies is considered one of the most comprehensive in the world
, balancing consumer protection, data privacy, and market competition.
The Way Ahead for India: Need for Reform in India’s Competition Law
Despite CCI’s proactive stance, India’s current competition law—
the Competition Act, 2002, lacks explicit provisions to tackle data-centric monopolies.
Traditional antitrust frameworks focus primarily on price-based dominance,
whereas digital markets function on the principles of data aggregation and network effects.
Therefore,
legal reforms must introduce ‘data monopolization’ as a key parameter for assessing market dominance.
would require redefining terms such as ‘market power
’ and “dominant position” to align with the realities of digital competition.
One potential solution could
be mandating interoperability and data-sharing agreements to prevent monopolistic control over user information.
Additionally,
India could benefit from integrating its competition law with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
, to ensure a coordinated approach between data protection and market regulation.
Drawing inspiration from the EU’s combination of the DMA and GDPR,
India could create a more holistic framework to tackle the challenges of data exploitation and anti-competitive practices.
Conclusion
The CCI’s action against Meta is a significant step in regulating the digital economy
, but it also underscores the urgent need for legal reforms.
As
data-driven monopolies continue to shape market dynamics, India must modernise its competition laws
to effectively address these emerging challenges.
By learning from global regulatory efforts and implementing forward-looking policies,
India can develop a competitive and fair digital marketplace
while ensuring consumer privacy and innovation.
The Meta case is not just a legal battle; it is a pivotal moment in the broader discourse on digital market regulation
, shaping the future of India’s digital economy.

**********India a stabilising factor in the Arctic
Why in news?
Speaking at an India-Russia Arctic conference, Russian Ambassador to India emphasized India’s growing role in the
as a stabilizing force amid rising militarization by NATO countries.
The conference was organized by Vivekananda International Foundation and The Northern Forum of Russia.
What’s in today’s article?
India’s Strategic and Economic Interests in the Arctic
India-Russia Relations in the Arctic
India’s Role as a Stabilising Factor in the Arctic
India’s 2022 Arctic Policy takes a whole-of-government approach, focusing on climate, economy, and governance.
However, it overlooks rising militarization and great power rivalries.
To safeguard long-term strategic interests, India must incorporate a seventh pillar addressing geopolitical dynamics.
Economic Opportunities in the Arctic
The melting Arctic ice is reshaping global shipping routes.
While the Northern Sea Route (NSR) offers limited advantages for India, linking the
International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)
with Russia’s Unified Deep-Water System (UDWS) could reduce costs and stimulate hinterland development.
Additionally, the
Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor
aims to integrate with the NSR, potentially cutting travel time to Europe by two weeks.
Countering China’s Expanding Presence
China is aggressively investing in the Russian Arctic, particularly in energy and infrastructure, under its Polar Silk Road initiative.
With a US$10 billion investment, China’s growing presence threatens India’s strategic and economic interests.
Collaborating with Russia on the NSR can counterbalance China’s dominance, secure India’s energy supply, and prevent Russia from becoming overly reliant on China.
Navigating Geopolitical Dynamics
The Arctic is becoming a strategic battleground, with China asserting itself as a “near-Arctic state.”
While India’s policy emphasizes sustainability, it must also strengthen strategic autonomy through diversified partnerships.
By engaging in Arctic affairs, India can protect its energy security and assert influence in a multipolar world order.
India’s growing interest in the Arctic’s hydrocarbon and mineral reserves is closely tied to its partnership with Russia.
With 50-55% of the Arctic’s coastline under Russian jurisdiction, India has invested $15 billion in Russian oil and gas projects, securing its economic and strategic foothold in the region.
Strengthening Bilateral Trade and Arctic Cooperation
At the 22nd Indo-Russia Summit, both nations committed to intensifying trade and investment, especially in the Russian Far East and Arctic zones.
A joint working body within IRIGC-TEC has been established to enhance collaboration on the Northern Sea Route (NSR).
They also set a goal to increase bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030.
Geopolitical and Energy Security Implications
As global power shifts towards Asia, India-Russia cooperation in the Arctic is becoming increasingly vital.
Russia controls 80% of Arctic oil and gas reserves, while India seeks reliable energy sources for its growing economy.
Russian Ambassador Denis Alipov emphasized India’s constructive approach in the Arctic, contrasting it with NATO’s militarization and unilateral policies, which have disrupted Arctic Council activities since 2022.
He reaffirmed Russia’s support for India’s growing presence in the region and its commitment to joint scientific, environmental, and commercial initiatives.
India-Russia Scientific Collaboration in the Arctic
Alipov highlighted areas of bilateral research cooperation, including climate change, atmospheric studies, geosciences, glaciology, and polar biology.
Indian scientists are also studying the Arctic’s influence on South Asian monsoons.
Institutions like the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (Russia) and the Indian National Centre for Polar and Oceanic Research are actively collaborating, supported by a 2024 memorandum on
Arctic research
Energy and Mineral Resource Cooperation
Both countries are exploring joint ventures in
Arctic energy and mineral resource extraction
Utilisation of the Northern Sea Route (NSR)
India and Russia are strengthening maritime cooperation through the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which provides a shorter trade corridor between Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific.
The India-Russia working group on NSR met in October to discuss cargo transit, polar navigation training for Indian sailors, and Arctic shipbuilding projects.
A MoU on NSR cooperation is under negotiation.
Expanding India’s Arctic Research Infrastructure
Russia has offered vacant research stations in the Arctic for India’s use.
India’s Strategic Investment in Russia’s Far East
As India expands its investments in Russia’s Far East, cooperation on the NSR was highlighted in Prime Minister Modi’s 2023 visit to Moscow.
Both nations aim to establish a stable and efficient transport corridor to strengthen their economic and geopolitical ties in the Greater Eurasian region.

**********The Looming Power Shortage
Why in news?
India’s rapid renewable energy expansion without adequate storage systems has led to growing electricity grid instability, with power shortages expected to rise in May and June.
This issue is worsened by a decade-old policy to scale down thermal power expansion, reducing critical baseload support during peak summer evenings.
Additionally, financial mismanagement in power distribution, driven by state governments’ reluctance to address revenue leaks and reliance on central lending utilities to cover discom losses, further exacerbates the crisis.
What’s in today’s article?
Rapid Growth of Renewables and Associated Challenges
Rising Power Demand and Grid Stability Concerns
Projected Power Shortages in Summer 2025
Urgent Need for Energy Storage Systems
Reviving Thermal Power to Address Shortages
India has been rapidly expanding renewable energy, adding over 21 GW (excluding large hydro) in the current fiscal year, bringing total capacity to 165 GW (212 GW with large hydro).
In contrast, coal-based thermal capacity stands at 220 GW.
Intermittency Challenges of Renewables
Unlike thermal power, which can be ramped up as needed, solar and wind energy depend on weather conditions.
Solar generation peaks in the afternoon but drops by evening, creating a supply gap when electricity demand surges due to air conditioner usage in North India.
Thermal Capacity Constraints in Non-Solar Hours
To meet evening demand, thermal plants are ramped up, but India’s coal-based capacity has grown only 7% since 2019-20, limiting its ability to fill the gap.
While past thermal additions (92 GW from 2012-2017) allowed grid operators to increase plant load factors (PLFs), most plants are now running at high PLFs, making further scaling difficult.
PLF measures a power plant's capacity utilization, expressed as the percentage of actual energy generated to the maximum possible energy it could have generated during a given period.
India’s peak power demand has surged from 169 GW in 2018-19 to 250 GW in 2024-25 and is expected to reach 270 GW this summer.
With growing reliance on renewables (from 72 GW in 2019-20 to over 150 GW in February 2025),
grid stability has become a major concern
India’s top grid operator anticipates power shortages from April to October, with May and June identified as high-risk months.
Unmet demand could reach 15-20 GW, especially during non-solar hours.
Risk of Load Shedding and Supply Deficits
The Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) for May is estimated at 19% in the best-case scenario and 31% in the median scenario, indicating a one-in-three chance of supply shortages. For June, the LOLP ranges from 4.7% to 20.1%.
LOLP in power systems engineering is the probability that the system fails to meet the demand for electrical power within a specified period, essentially indicating the risk of a power outage.
The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) recognizes the grid stability challenges posed by intermittent renewables.
Hence, it issued an advisory recommending
co-located
Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)
Pumped Storage Plants (PSP)
with solar projects
These systems can store surplus solar power during the day and release it when demand peaks in non-solar hours.
Current Storage Capacity vs. Growing Renewable Base
While India’s total renewable energy capacity has surpassed 200 GW, its installed energy storage capacity remains low at just 4.75 GW (PSP) and 0.11 GW (BESS) as of late 2024.
Importance of Timely Deployment
The National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC) warns that delays in BESS and PSP commissioning could worsen energy shortages, especially during peak demand periods.
Ensuring timely deployment will improve grid flexibility, support renewable integration, and mitigate reliability risks.
To increase active generation capacity, the National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC) has suggested invoking
Section 11 of the Electricity Act, 2003 to mandate higher operational levels for imported coal-based plants
These plants are typically used less due to their higher costs, but their optimal utilization during peak demand could help mitigate supply shortages.
Hidden Costs of Renewable Energy
To manage power intermittency, aging thermal units are being kept on standby, but this leads to high costs.
Experts argue that the assumption of renewables achieving grid parity is misleading, as factoring in standby thermal power nearly doubles the cost of renewable electricity.
Policy Missteps & Their Consequences
Decisions taken over the past decade are now affecting grid stability.
The National Electricity Plan (2017-22) had ruled out fresh thermal capacity additions beyond 2022, except for 50 GW of under-construction projects.
Imported coal-based projects were also discouraged due to global price volatility.
Corrective Measures Underway
Recognizing past planning failures, corrective actions have been initiated, including:
A renewed push for nuclear power in fleet mode
Belated Expansion of thermal capacity
Importing coal to restart idle plants
Mandating energy storage for all new solar projects under the latest Central Electricity Authority (CEA) directive
These measures aim to stabilize the grid and ensure a reliable power supply during high-demand periods.

**********[21st March 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: How do habitual offender laws discriminate?
Polity
PYQ Relevance:
Despite comprehensive policies for equity and social justice, underprivileged sections are not yet getting the full benefits of affirmative action envisaged by the Constitution. Comment.
(UPSC 2024)
Reason:
This question relates to the broader issue of systemic barriers preventing marginalized groups from accessing their rights and benefits, which is relevant to the discriminatory impact of habitual offender laws.
Mentor’s Comment:
The Supreme Court’s questioning of habitual offender laws highlights their colonial origins and continued misuse against Denotified Tribes, raising concerns about constitutional validity and human rights. Despite the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act in 1952, similar state laws persist, leading to discrimination. The UN and human rights bodies urge India to repeal them.
This issue is crucial for
GS-2 (Governance & Social Justice), GS-3 (Internal Security),
Ethics,
showcasing the need for legal reforms to balance security with civil liberties.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Recently, the Supreme Court of India has questioned the need for old laws that label some criminals as “habitual offenders.
What is “habitual offenders”?
A habitual offender is a person repeatedly convicted of crimes, often subject to stricter surveillance or penalties under special laws. In India, such classifications have historically targeted marginalized communities, including
leading to discrimination. The Supreme Court has questioned the constitutional validity of these laws, urging their review.
What is the origin of the ‘habitual offender’ classification?
Colonial-Era Criminalization (1793-1871)
– The process began with
Regulation XXII of 1793
, which allowed magistrates to imprison or put to work certain tribes based on suspicion. The
Indian Penal Code (1860)
Criminal Procedure Code (1861)
introduced a system for maintaining registers of “dacoits and thugs,” leading to the
Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) of 1871
, which officially labeled entire communities as “criminal tribes.”
Post-Independence Repeal & Denotification (1949-1952)
Criminal Tribes Act Enquiry Committee (1949-50)
recommended repealing the CTA, leading to its abolition in
. Communities previously classified as criminal were
denotified and categorized as Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNT, NT, SNT).
State-Level Habitual Offender Laws (1948-Present)
– After CTA’s repeal, States enacted
, shifting the focus from communities to individuals with past convictions. However,
the Lokur Committee (1965)
continued to view denotified tribes as having an
“anti-social heritage,”
reinforcing stereotypes.
What has the Supreme Court of India said about the classification of “habitual offenders”?
Constitutional Suspect & Targeting of Denotified Tribes
– In October 2023, the Supreme Court of India questioned the very basis of the “habitual offender” classification, calling it
“constitutionally suspect”
and stating that it was being used to
target members of denotified tribes
unfairly.
Example:
The SC pointed out that in states like Rajasthan,
prison manuals explicitly referred to denotified tribes as “habitual offenders”
, perpetuating historical discrimination.
Whole Communities Cannot Be Criminalized
– The Court emphasized that
no entire community should be labeled as criminals
, just as was done under the colonial-era
, which was repealed in 1952.
The SC noted that habitual offender laws
essentially replaced the CTA
, reinforcing stereotypes against denotified tribes and nomadic groups.
Urged States to Review and Repeal the Laws
– While deciding a case on
caste discrimination in prisons
, the SC urged state governments to
review whether such laws were necessary
and ensure that they are
not used for social discrimination
In response,
Punjab and Odisha stated they had not implemented the law in over five years
, and Andhra Pradesh reported that
no prisoners were classified under it
Why were certain communities historically criminalized under colonial laws like the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871?
Colonial Control & Surveillance
– The British classified certain nomadic and tribal communities as
“criminal tribes”
to maintain strict surveillance and control over mobile populations they saw as a threat to law and order. These groups did not conform to settled agricultural lifestyles, making them difficult to regulate.
Lambada (Banjara) community
, traditionally nomadic traders, were branded as criminals to restrict their movement.
Perceived Threat to British Interests
– Many of these communities had been warriors, rebels, or supporters of local rulers who resisted British rule. The British saw them as a security threat and sought to suppress their influence.
Thuggee suppression
campaign led to the criminalization of
Thuggee gangs
, whom the British accused of organized robbery and ritual killings, justifying mass arrests and executions.
Economic & Labor Exploitation
– By labeling entire communities as criminal, the British forced them into state surveillance systems, making it easier to recruit them for low-wage, bonded labor. Many were compelled to work under colonial infrastructure projects.
Members of the
Domb and Kuruva communities
were used for forced labor in road and railway construction.
Social & Racial Stereotyping
– The British imposed their
own racial biases
, believing certain castes and tribes were inherently criminal or “born criminals.” They institutionalized these stereotypes in official records, further marginalizing these groups.
Sansis and Pardhis
, historically hunter-gatherers, were deemed criminal simply because of their alternative livelihoods.
Weakening Indigenous Resistance & Policing Society
– The act helped
British authorities justify mass surveillance, arrests, and forced resettlement
, weakening traditional structures of self-governance and making people more dependent on the colonial system.
Kolis in western India
, once involved in anti-British uprisings, were listed as habitual offenders, stripping them of economic and political power.
Which states have repealed or discontinued the implementation of habitual offender laws?
Haryana
: The state has officially repealed its habitual offender laws, removing such legislation from its legal framework.​
: While the habitual offender law has not been formally repealed, Punjab has effectively discontinued its application. Over the past five years, the state has neither maintained registers of habitual offenders nor issued any related orders, indicating a de facto cessation of the law’s enforcement. ​
: Similarly, Odisha has not registered any cases under its habitual offender law in the last five years, effectively discontinuing its implementation. ​
: The state has confirmed that no individuals are currently imprisoned under the habitual offender law, indicating its non-enforcement.
How have international organizations like the United Nations responded to India’s habitual offender laws?
UN Special Rapporteurs’ Criticism (2021-2022): UN Special Rapporteurs on Contemporary Forms of Racism and Minority Issues
criticized India’s habitual offender laws
for disproportionately targeting certain marginalized communities, such as
Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
They have highlighted that these laws
perpetuate colonial-era stigmatization
and violate
international human rights principles
Universal Periodic Review (UPR) at the UNHRC (2017, 2022):
United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
has featured discussions on the
criminalization of DNTs
and the
misuse of habitual offender laws
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Concerns:
UN Human Rights Committee
, which oversees compliance with the
, has expressed concerns that habitual offender laws
violate fundamental rights
protection from arbitrary detention (Article 9)
non-discrimination (Article 26)
Example: The
Committee has asked India to review laws
that enable police to
harass and surveil individuals based on past convictions
rather than actual offenses.
UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) Recommendations:
has criticized habitual offender laws for
reinforcing caste-based and ethnic discrimination
, particularly against
nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes
CERD has urged India
repeal these laws
and introduce policies that protect the
rights of Denotified Tribes
instead of labeling them as criminals.
Reports by UN Agencies and Human Rights Organizations:
UNICEF and the OHCHR (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights)
have highlighted how habitual offender laws
restrict freedom of movement
socio-economic opportunities
for affected communities.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International
have also supported
UN recommendations
, calling for
eliminate discrimination against DNTs and other marginalized groups
Way forward:
Legal Reforms & Repeal of Habitual Offender Laws:
States should
review and repeal
habitual offender laws that disproportionately target Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and marginalized groups. The government should enact
rehabilitation policies
to ensure socio-economic inclusion instead of criminal surveillance.
Human Rights-Based Approach & Community Integration:
Need to
Implement
affirmative action programs
for DNTs, including access to education, employment, and legal aid.
**********The assault on multilateralism and international law
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to multilateral institutions;
Why in the News?
The US’s independent actions could lead to global pushback, but they also create an opportunity for non-Western nations to step up as leaders.
What are the key multilateral institutions and agreements from which the U.S. has signalled withdrawal under the Trump administration?
World Health Organization (WHO):
The U.S. announced withdrawal in 2020, accusing WHO of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and being overly influenced by China.
United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC):
The U.S. exited in 2018, citing alleged bias against Israel and ineffective handling of human rights abuses.
Paris Climate Agreement:
The U.S. formally withdrew in 2020, arguing that the agreement unfairly burdened its economy while benefiting competitors like China and India.
Example
: The withdrawal slowed global climate efforts, as the U.S. is one of the largest carbon emitters.
International Criminal Court (ICC):
The U.S. imposed sanctions on ICC officials in 2020, rejecting its authority over American troops and allies.
: Sanctions were placed on ICC officials investigating alleged U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan.
World Trade Organization (WTO):
The U.S. blocked appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, crippling its ability to resolve trade disputes.
: This led to a breakdown in the global trade dispute resolution system, impacting countries like India and China.
What is the DEFUND Act?
Disengaging Entirely from the United Nations Debacle (DEFUND) Act
is a proposed U.S. legislation introduced by Senator Mike Lee. It seeks to completely withdraw the U.S. from the
United Nations (UN)
, repeal key participation laws, cut all funding, and revoke diplomatic immunity for UN officials within the U.S.
Why does the proposed DEFUND Act pose a threat to the legitimacy of the United Nations?
Financial Crisis for the UN:
The U.S. is the largest financial contributor to the UN, funding around 22% of its budget. The DEFUND Act would halt all U.S. contributions, severely affecting UN operations.
: The UN’s peacekeeping missions and humanitarian aid programs in conflict zones like
Syria and Yemen
would face funding shortages.
Weakening of Multilateral Cooperation:
The Act would repeal key legislation like the
United Nations Participation Act of 1945
, severing U.S. engagement with the UN. This could encourage other nations to follow suit, undermining the UN’s credibility.
: Without U.S. involvement, the UN Security Council may struggle to enforce resolutions, reducing its effectiveness in global crisis management.
Legal and Diplomatic Challenges:
The Act would revoke the diplomatic immunity of UN officials in the U.S., disrupting UN functions and diplomatic activities.
: The UN Headquarters in New York might face operational difficulties, making it harder to conduct international negotiations.
How has the U.S. administration’s stance on the International Criminal Court (ICC) impacted global accountability for human rights violations?
Undermining International Justice Mechanisms:
in 2020, accusing the court of targeting American personnel and allies. This weakened the ICC’s ability to investigate
war crimes and crimes against humanity
, particularly in conflict zones like
Afghanistan and Palestine
Encouraging Non-Cooperation with the ICC:
The U.S.’s
non-recognition
of the ICC has emboldened other nations to ignore its rulings, reducing its global influence. Countries under investigation may refuse cooperation, limiting the court’s effectiveness in
ensuring accountability
Example:
Israel rejected ICC jurisdiction in its war crimes probe in Palestinian territories, citing U.S. opposition to the investigation.
Weakening the Principle of Universal Justice:
By discrediting the ICC and blocking investigations, the U.S. has set a
precedent for selective justice
, where powerful nations can evade accountability while weaker states remain subject to scrutiny.
The ICC struggles to prosecute major powers like China or Russia, as the U.S.’s stance encourages a
lack of enforcement
in high-stakes human rights cases.
What are the chances for non-Western nations to assume global leadership roles?
Expanding Economic and Political Influence
– Emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil are increasing their global footprint through trade, technology, and strategic alliances.
China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) enhances its economic influence across Asia, Africa, and Europe.
Strengthening Regional and Multilateral Institutions
– Non-Western nations are actively shaping global governance through regional organizations and alternative institutions.
The BRICS bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) launched the New Development Bank (NDB) as an alternative to Western-led financial institutions.
Leadership in Global Crisis Management
– Developing nations are taking initiative in addressing global challenges like climate change, health crises, and digital transformation.
India’s Vaccine Maitri initiative supplied COVID-19 vaccines to over 100 countries, reinforcing its role in global health diplomacy.
What would be the impact on India?
Challenges to Multilateralism and Global Governance:
The U.S. exit from key institutions like the
UN, WHO, and WTO
weakens the global rules-based order, making international cooperation more fragmented. India, which strongly supports
multilateral diplomacy
, may face difficulties in global negotiations, including trade, climate change, and security.
The U.S. withdrawal from the
(2017) reduced global climate finance commitments, impacting India’s renewable energy goals.
Opportunity for India to Assume Leadership:
As the U.S. retreats, India can
play a more prominent role
in shaping multilateral decision-making, advocating for reforms in the
UNSC and WTO
, and positioning itself as a bridge between developing and developed nations.
During the
G-20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting (2025)
, India emphasized the need for
inclusive multilateralism
, strengthening its diplomatic standing.
Way forward:
Strengthen Multilateral Leadership
– India should actively engage in
UN reforms, WTO negotiations, and climate diplomacy
, positioning itself as a stabilizing force in global governance.
Diversify Strategic Alliances
– India must deepen partnerships with
EU, ASEAN, and African nations
, enhancing trade, security, and diplomatic ties to counterbalance U.S. disengagement.
Mains PYQ:
“Critically examine the role of WHO in providing global health security during the Covid-19 pandemic.
(UPSC 2020)
Reason:
The World Health Organization (WHO) has faced calls for withdrawal by certain nations, highlighting a challenge to multilateral institutions. This PYQ directly assesses the role and, by extension, the relevance and effectiveness of the WHO in a global crisis, which is pertinent to discussions on the assault on multilateralism.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Digital Market challenges;
Why in the News?
On November 18, 2024, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) imposed a fine of ₹213.14 crore on Meta Platforms, Inc., for
abusing its dominant position through WhatsApp’s 2021 Privacy Policy.
This landmark decision underscores the growing intersection of competition law and data privacy, marking a significant step in regulating digital markets in India.
What were the key findings of the Competition Commission of India (CCI)?
Abuse of Dominant Position in OTT Messaging & Online Advertising:
CCI found that WhatsApp’s
2021 privacy policy update
forced users to mandatorily consent to data sharing with Meta (Facebook, Instagram), strengthening WhatsApp’s dominance.
Unfair Data Collection & Competitive Advantage:
Meta leveraged WhatsApp’s vast user base to collect personal data, creating an unfair advantage in digital advertising by refining targeted ads.
Potential Harm to Consumer Privacy & Competition:
The policy update allowed
cross-platform data sharing
, which CCI considered an unfair trade practice that compromised user privacy and created barriers for rival messaging apps.
Violation of Fair Market Practices & Entry Barriers:
The data-sharing policy made it difficult for new entrants to compete, as they lacked access to similar user insights, reinforcing Meta’s market position.
Example:
Startups like Telegram faced challenges in growing due to WhatsApp’s entrenched market power and data-driven network effects.
Imposition of Fine & Behavioral Remedies:
fined Meta ₹213.14 crore
and imposed a
five-year ban
on sharing WhatsApp user data with Facebook and Instagram for advertising purposes.
This aimed to limit Meta’s ability to exploit its dominant position and create a level playing field in India’s digital ecosystem.
Why did the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) grant a stay on CCI’s five-year ban and penalty imposed on Meta?
Prima Facie Case for Meta:
NCLAT found
grounds to review CCI’s decision
, indicating that Meta’s appeal had merit and required further examination.
Meta argued that its privacy policy update did not force users but offered them a choice, which needed deeper legal scrutiny.
Irreparable Harm to Meta’s Business:
The five-year ban on sharing WhatsApp user data with Facebook and Instagram could cause
significant financial and operational disruption
to Meta’s business.
Meta claimed that restricting data integration would affect its targeted advertising model, reducing its revenue from India.
Dominance and anti-competitive effects:
NCLAT noted that
CCI’s conclusions on abuse of dominance and anti-competitive effects required further legal and economic analysis
before enforcement.
The tribunal wanted to assess whether the policy update genuinely
harmed consumers
or merely provided better services through personalized ads.
Balance of Convenience:
The tribunal ruled that
temporarily halting the penalty and data-sharing ban would not cause immediate harm to consumers
but would protect Meta from disproportionate damages while the case was under review.
If Meta had to immediately comply but later won the appeal, reversing the business impact would be difficult.
Conditional Relief with Partial Penalty Payment:
granted the stay but directed Meta to deposit 50% of the ₹213.14 crore penalty
, ensuring some accountability while legal proceedings continued.
This allowed Meta to continue operations without full compliance but ensured it remained engaged in the legal process.
How does data play a role in creating and sustaining dominance in digital markets?
Data-Driven Network Effects:
More users generate more data, which improves algorithms and services, attracting even more users, creating a self-reinforcing loop.
Google’s search engine improves as more users search, making its results better than competitors, reinforcing its market dominance.
Competitive Barrier Through Data Aggregation:
Large tech firms collect massive user data across multiple services, making it hard for new entrants to compete due to a lack of comparable datasets.
Meta collects data from Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, allowing it to offer highly personalized ads, making it difficult for smaller ad platforms to compete.
Monetization & Market Lock-In:
Companies use vast data pools to refine targeted advertising, personalize user experiences, and create dependencies, discouraging users from switching.
Amazon leverages consumer purchase data to optimize product recommendations, making it harder for new e-commerce platforms to attract customers.
Which global regulatory actions have been taken against Meta and Google for their anti-competitive practices?
Heavy Antitrust Fines:
Governments have imposed
billions in fines
on Meta and Google for abusing their market dominance.
European Commission
fined Google
€8 billion
across three cases, including unfair dominance in mobile operating systems (Android) and online advertising.
Similarly, the
Bundeskartellamt (Germany’s Federal Cartel Office)
found Meta guilty of merging user data without consent, violating
EU competition law
GDPR
Structural and Behavioral Restrictions:
Authorities have enforced
regulatory measures
breaking up monopolistic control, imposing interoperability, and preventing self-preferencing
U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
filed a lawsuit against Meta for acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition.
Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU
now mandates that dominant firms like Meta and Google ensure fair access to platforms, prevent self-preferencing, and allow third-party data-sharing.
What should be amendments in India’s Competition Act, 2002 to address data-centric monopolies? (Way forward)
Recognizing “Data Monopolization” as a Form of Market Power:
The Act should explicitly define
data dominance
as a key factor in determining
EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA)
considers large data control a sign of dominance. India could adopt similar provisions to regulate companies like Meta and Google that leverage massive user data to eliminate competition.
Mandatory Interoperability and Data-Sharing Regulations:
mandate interoperability
restrict exclusive data-sharing agreements
that create entry barriers for competitors.
, Meta was restricted from combining user data across platforms without explicit consent. Similarly, India could
prevent dominant firms from self-preferencing their services
and enforce
data portability rules
to promote fair competition.
