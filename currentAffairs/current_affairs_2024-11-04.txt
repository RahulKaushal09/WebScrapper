A New Tryst with Destiny: India Could Not Create Mass Prosperity. It Is Not Too Late
Context
In the past 50 years,
the economic trajectories of China and India have presented economic historians with a compelling puzzle
; China, an autocracy, has seen robust wage growth yet meagre public market returns,
reporting an approximate 13% decline in the last two decades.
In contrast,
India, a democracy, has experienced substantial returns in its public market, around 1,300% in the same period
, while wage growth has been comparatively weak.
Amid these developments,
it is crucial to examine India’s economic journey, persistent challenges and underlying factors shaping these outcomes, as well as potential strategies
for addressing India’s unique challenges.
An Analysis of India’s Economic Journey: Progress and Persistent Challenges
India’s Progress
India has made noteworthy progress since its independence in 1947
, transforming itself into the world’s largest democracy despite its deeply hierarchical society.
In just a few decades, life expectancy increased from 31 to 68 years
, and the country rose to middle-income status.
However, India’s aspirations
for social justice are
hindered by historical constraints.
Social mobility,
critical for economic growth and equity, remains 40% lower in middle-income nations like India
than in high-income countries.
Additionally,
the global track record for countries transitioning to high-income status
is dismal.
Only 34 economies, with a combined population of around 250 million, have reached this milestone since 1990,
underscoring the considerable challenges India faces.
India’s Challenges
India’s challenge centres on employed poverty
rather than unemployment.
The
labour force distribution reveals a stagnant structure: 45% in agriculture, 14% in construction, 30% in services,
and only 11% in manufacturing.
Most of India’s agricultural workers are trapped in informal self-employment,
eking out a living with minimal productivity.
This phenomenon, termed self-exploitation, stands in stark contrast to China’s success
in shifting millions from farms to factories.
While India has a sizeable labour force and adequate land and capital, it has not replicated China’s scale of manufacturing growth
despite substantial foreign direct investment and macroeconomic stability.
The Importance of Manufacturing for India’s Economic Growth
A Pathway Out of Poverty by Providing Jobs
Manufacturing can play a crucial role in India's development
due to its capacity to create jobs across the skill spectrum, enhance productivity,
and stimulate broader economic activity.
In countries like China, manufacturing provided a pathway out of poverty for millions, who transitioned from farming to factory work
, gaining access to stable wages and better working conditions.
In India,
however, only 11% of the labour force is employed in manufacturing
, which has kept wage growth sluggish and poverty levels high despite overall economic growth.
Less Reliance on Agriculture
For India,
expanding the manufacturing sector could transform its labour force structure,
decreasing the reliance on low-productivity agriculture and creating new opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled workers.
The goal would be to gradually increase manufacturing employment to 25%
of the labour force by 2035.
It would require a combination of policy reforms, infrastructure investments,
and regulatory changes to support industry growth.
Structural Constraints Hindering Manufacturing Growth
Regulatory Barriers and Regulatory Cholesterol
One of the biggest challenges
for manufacturing in India is
what is often referred to as regulatory cholesterol.
It is a
complex and burdensome regulatory environment
that
disproportionately affects small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
Indian business landscape is dotted with myriad compliance requirements, filings, and licensing needs
that can be especially cumbersome for smaller firms.
These regulations,
while intended to ensure standards and safety, often lead to excessive compliance costs, and discourage formalisation
, which in turn limits these firms’ growth potential and productivity.
Informal Employment and Limited Scale of Small Enterprises
A significant portion of India’s manufacturing sector is dominated by informal enterprises,
which are typically small-scale and lack the resources to upgrade technology, train workers, or access formal financing.
informal nature of these enterprises makes it challenging to improve productivity and achieve economies of scale
, which are crucial for competing in global markets.
Large companies, which tend to be more productive and capable of employing thousands of workers,
are relatively rare in India’s manufacturing sector.
This structural characteristic has kept the manufacturing sector fragmented
and unable to drive large-scale employment.
Infrastructure and Skill Gaps
While infrastructure and skills were previously cited as major obstacles
to manufacturing, recent improvements have lessened these barriers.
Massive investments in infrastructure have improved India’s transportation networks,
energy supply, and logistics systems, essential for the smooth functioning of manufacturing operations.
Skill development has also seen significant progress through initiatives like the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
, which aims to enhance educational quality and employability by promoting holistic learning and vocational training.
Despite these advances, gaps remain, particularly in skill alignment with industry needs.
Although education levels are rising, there remains a mismatch between the skills workers possess and the skills required by modern manufacturing jobs.
Low Levels of Investment in Technology and Innovation
Another structural constraint
in India’s manufacturing sector is the relatively
low level of technological investment and innovation.
Many Indian firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises
, operate with limited technological resources, which reduces their competitiveness on a global scale.
Unlike China, where technological advancements and productivity gains have fuelled rapid manufacturing growth
, India’s manufacturing sector is still heavily reliant on labour-intensive, low-productivity activities.
India’s Path Forward to Realising the Full Potential of India’s Manufacturing Sector
Balancing Democracy and Economic Development
India faces a unique challenge in
balancing democratic values with economic growth.
Unlike China, which prioritised rapid industrialisation at the expense of personal freedoms,
India’s democratic framework calls for a more nuanced approach.
potential for manufacturing employment to rise to 18-20% of the workforce
within the next decade is a realistic goal.
Domestic Consumption as a Growth Engine and Strategic Manufacturing Policy
India’s large domestic market presents a growth opportunity
that China has historically underutilised, having prioritized exports and investment, however, India must harness this market to bolster manufacturing.
By promoting Make for India policies
, domestic manufacturing
could fulfil local demand while also building the foundation for export competitiveness.
For instance,
the automotive sector in India has flourished by supporting both domestic and international manufacturers
, creating a level playing field that enabled the development of supply chains, scale, and exports.
Infrastructure Investments
Infrastructure investments should continue
, with a particular focus on improving logistics and transportation networks to reduce costs for manufacturers.
Expanding vocational training programs to bridge skill gaps
and align educational outcomes with industry
demands is also critical.
Finally, policies that encourage innovation, research, and technology adoption
within manufacturing
can help India move up the value chain and compete globally.
Conclusion
Despite its democratic achievements,
India has yet to fulfil its tryst with destiny by establishing widespread prosperity.
Nevertheless,
recent reforms and a policy focus on manufacturing could help India overcome its economic challenges.
By creating high-productivity firms and expanding employment opportunities
in manufacturing,
India can set a course toward sustained economic growth.

**********What is Iron Beam?
Israel's 'Iron Beam', designed to use a high-power laser to down projectiles, will be operational within a year, according to reports.
About Iron Beam:
The Iron Beam, also known as Magen or Light Shield, is a new laser-based missile defence system developed by Israel.
It is a 100kW class High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) that is expected to become the first operational system in its class.
It is a directed-energy weapon air defence system that fires powerful beams of light that can destroy fast-moving projectiles.
Built by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Iron Beam was first unveiled in 2014.
Its operational range extends up to 7 km (4.3 miles).
Advantages:
With a continuous energy supply for the laser, the advantage lies in never depleting ammunition, ensuring a sustained capability for defense.
The absence of conventional ammunition will directly result in significant cost savings.
Complementing Israel’s Irom Dome, it can be integrated with a range of platforms and can become part of any multilayer defence system.
Disadvantages:
Diminished effectiveness during restricted visibility, such as heavy cloud cover or adverse weather conditions.
It cannot operate effectively in wet conditions—the more moisture in the atmosphere, the more water particles absorb the laser’s energy.
Iron Beam requires a direct line of sight between the system and its target, making its placement far more critical.
It also has a much slower rate of fire, requiring five seconds or so to transmit sufficient energy to destroy its target.

**********What is Alstonia scholaris?
Even though Cyclone Dana triggered heavy rain in Kolkata, it did bring relief to those with allergies and asthma, as the heavy showers led to chhatim trees (Alstonia scholaris) shedding flowers that have a strong fragrance.
About Alstonia scholaris:
Alstonia scholaris, commonly called blackboard tree, scholar tree, milkwood, or devil's tree in English, is an evergreen tropical tree in the dogbane family (Apocynaceae).
It is called 'Saptaparna' in India. It has been cited in the Charaka and Sushrutha Samhithas.
Distribution: This tree is widespread across the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and southern China, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates.
Features:
It grows to a height of 10–20 meters, sometimes reaching up to 40 meters.
It has dark grey bark and a crown of simple, whorled leaves arranged in clusters of seven, giving rise to the name "saptaparni" (meaning "seven leaves").
Flowers: Small, fragrant, and greenish-white flowers bloom in clusters during late autumn and early winter.
Uses:
The bark, leaves, and other parts of Alstonia scholaris have been used in traditional medicine for treating respiratory conditions, fever, skin disorders, and digestive issues.
The soft, lightweight wood of the blackboard tree was historically used for making writing slates and blackboards, which is how it got the common name "blackboard tree."

**********What is a Transponder?
The Central government has planned to install indigenously developed transponders on one lakh fishing vessels for a two-way communication and support system that enhances the safety and security of fishermen at sea.
About Transponder:
A transponder is a wireless communication, monitoring, or control device that picks up and automatically responds to an incoming signal.
The term is a combination of transmitter and responder.
Transponders are typically used for detecting, identifying, and locating objects, but they can also be used in other technologies, such as satellites to relay communications signals.
Transponders are commonly found in both civilian and military aircraft and in objects, such as car keys.
How do transponders work?
Transponders operate using radio frequencies and respond to wireless monitoring, communications, and control device signals.
When sent a signal-also called an interrogator-a transponder responds by returning an identifying signal.
The information included in the response varies depending on the type of transponder but can include location and identifying codes.
The transponder automatically sends back a radio signal at a predetermined frequency.
To receive and send signals simultaneously, receiving and transmitting signals must be set at different frequencies.
For Example: An air traffic controller can send an interrogator signal and receive identifying information on an aircraft. This enables the control tower to track the aircraft in the surrounding airspace and provide other information to help the pilots maintain adequate distance from other aircraft.
Transponders are used with the following technologies:
aircraft identification;
communications satellites;
vehicle keys;
optical communications;
sonar;
electronic toll collection systems;
lap timing and tyre identification for motorsports; and
magnetic labels on credit cards.

**********Global Tuberculosis (TB) Report 2024
The Global TB Report 2024 has acknowledged the tremendous progress India has made in closing the gap of missed TB cases since 2015.
About Global TB Report:
It is an annual report published by the World Health Organization (WHO).
It provides a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the TB epidemic and of progress in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease at global, regional, and country levels.
Highlights of the 2024 Report:
It shows 8.2 million people were newly diagnosed with TB in 2023, a figure that represents the highest number of TB cases recorded by the WHO since it began global TB monitoring in 1995.
It also marks a significant increase from the 7.5 million new TB cases reported in 2022.
Although the estimated number of 1.25 million TB deaths in 2023 is down from the 1.32 million recorded in 2022 and continues a declining trend from the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, that number still far surpasses the 320,000 COVID deaths officially reported to the WHO last year.
The data show that 30 mostly low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear 87% of the global TB burden, with five countries—India (26%), Indonesia (10%), China (6.8%), the Philippines (6.8%), and Pakistan (6.3%)—combining for 56% of the burden.
55 percent of people who developed TB were men, 33 percent were women, and 12 percent were children and young adolescents.
According to the report, a significant number of new TB cases are driven by five major risk factors: undernutrition, HIV infection, alcohol use disorders, smoking, and diabetes.
In 2023, India was estimated to have had 27 lakh TB cases, of which 25.1 lakh persons were diagnosed and put on treatment.
This has buoyed India's treatment coverage to 89 percent in 2023 from 72 percent in 2015, thereby bridging the gap of missing cases.
It acknowledged a drop in India's TB incidence - from 237 per lakh population in 2015, to 195 per lakh population in 2023, accounting for a 17.7 percent decline.

**********Turtle Wildlife Sanctuary
The National Green Tribunal has castigated three district magistrates of Uttar Pradesh and the member secretary of the state's pollution control board for granting permission "in a mechanical manner" for mining works in the state's turtle wildlife sanctuary.
About Turtle Wildlife Sanctuary:
Turtle (Kachhua) Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the Varanasi District of Uttar Pradesh.
It was touted as the first freshwater turtle wildlife sanctuary in the country.
The protected area is a 7 km stretch of the Ganga River flowing through Varanasi city from Ramnagar Fort to Malviya Rail/Road Bridge.
The sanctuary was declared to ensure the survival of turtles released into the Ganga River in Varanasi.
The turtles were released to promote the organic removal of half-burnt human corpses, which are dumped into the river after final rites under Hindu tradition.
To get rid of these without hurting the sentiments of the people, the Ganga Action Plan supported the breeding and release of turtles into the river.
The idea behind the action was that this would in turn nurture a good population of the already dwindling population of Indian softshell turtles.
Turtle hatchlings are reared at the breeding center in Sarnath and subsequently released into the Ganges River once they become mature enough to survive in their natural habitat.
According to local officials, about 2,000 turtle eggs are brought to the centre from the Chambal and Yamuna rivers every year.
The sanctuary is also home to the Gangetic Dolphin, other species of turtles, and several species of fish, including Rohu, Tengra, and Bhakur.

**********Reserve Bank bringing back its gold assets to India
Why in news?
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has brought back nearly 130 metric tonnes of gold owned by it and kept in safe custody of the Bank of England in the last two-and-a-half years.
This decision marks a shift in the RBI's approach to safeguarding its gold reserves, with a 60% increase in domestic gold holdings during this period.
What’s in today’s article?
Rise in the RBI's domestic gold holding
Gold Kept in Bank of England
RBI’s strategy to bring back its gold assets to India
As of September 2024, the RBI's domestic gold holding has increased to 510.46 metric tonnes, up from 295.82 metric tonnes in March 2022.
Presently, around 324 metric tonnes of the RBI's gold remains under the custodianship of the Bank of England, a reduction from 453.52 metric tonnes in March 2022.
In value terms (USD), the
proportion of gold in India's total foreign exchange reserves rose from 8.15% at the end of March 2024 to approximately 9.32% at the end of September 2024
One of the world's largest gold vaults
The Bank of England hosts one of the world's largest gold vaults, second only to the New York Federal Reserve.
It stores around 400,000 bars of gold, holding gold for many central banks worldwide.
This facility incurs a cost for gold safekeeping
India’s gold in Bank of England
The RBI continues to retain 324 tonnes of its gold reserves under the protection of the Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements, which collectively hold a substantial portion of India's gold abroad.
Around 20 tonnes are additionally managed through gold deposit schemes.
Storing part of India’s gold in London provides the RBI with immediate access to the London bullion market, allowing for enhanced liquidity
Historically, in 1991, India sent 47 tonnes of gold to the Bank of England during a balance of payments crisis to secure funds for repaying international creditors.
Central Banks Buying Gold
Since the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia in 2022 following the Ukraine invasion,
central banks globally have been increasing their gold reserves as a hedge against inflation
and to decrease reliance on the U.S. dollar.
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,
India has purchased gold at a faster pace than any other G20 country, surpassing both Russia and China
This trend, termed "de-dollarisation," aims to diversify away from the dollar amidst a surge in gold prices. That’s why central banks are buying gold.
Significance of this strategy
Sign of a strong economy
In 1991, at the time of a severely difficult economic phase, RBI had to pledge some gold to raise funds.
At that time, it was also remembered as a sign of a weak economy.
Now, bringing back gold reflects the recovery and a major change in the strength of Indian economy.
Optimizing financial resources
Since RBI has gold deposits mostly held internationally, the decision to bring back some of it will
save the cost of storage, which is being paid to foreign banks
Strategic significance
This is part of a broader strategy to make better use of the national asset in terms of worldwide instability.
Globally, central banks are increasingly investing in gold as a safe-haven asset, partly as a strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.
India’s decision to repatriate and store gold domestically aligns with this global trend and demonstrates a strong belief in the resilience of its economy.
Rise in safe-keeping capacity
The RBI has been steadily repatriating gold from the Bank of England, citing improved domestic capacity for physical storage.
As per the RBI Governor, the increasing amount of gold held by the RBI within India as part of its reserve management strategy, emphasizing the importance of maintaining domestic storage capacity.
As of October 25, 2024, India's total foreign exchange reserves have risen to $684.8 billion, sufficient to cover over 11.2 months of imports (as of June 2024).
Diversification
Increasing gold reserves allows India to diversify its foreign exchange holdings, reducing reliance on any single currency and mitigating risks from currency fluctuations and economic instability.
Gold, as a stable global asset, provides a safe haven, balancing the reserves portfolio and shielding the economy from shocks affecting specific currencies.
This diversification strengthens financial security and gives the government greater flexibility in economic management, bolstering the overall stability and resilience of the economy.
Hedge Against Inflation
Gold acts as a hedge against inflation, retaining or appreciating in value when currencies lose purchasing power.
By increasing gold reserves, a country protects its economy from inflation's negative effects, ensuring stability for long-term financial planning and investor confidence.
Substantial gold reserves safeguard against currency devaluation, preserving national wealth amid economic uncertainties.
Conclusion
The RBI's recent transfer of gold from the UK marks a key step in strengthening India's economy.
This move preserves national assets, prepares for future economic challenges, and aligns with global central banks’ recognition of gold’s role in ensuring long-term stability.

**********Black hole Triple System
A new study says scientists have discovered a “black hole triple” in space for the first time.
About Black Hole Triple System:
The system comprises a black hole at its centre, currently in the process of consuming a small star spiralling very close to it.
There is also a second star, which appears to be circling the black hole but is actually far away.
The discovery of the system, located about 8,000 light years away from Earth has raised questions about how black holes are formed.
Many black holes discovered until now have been part of binary systems, consisting of a black hole and a secondary object (such as a star or another black hole).
But the black hole triple not only has one star which orbits the black hole about every 6.5 days, but also a more far-off star which orbits it every 70,000 years.
It is situated in the constellation of Cygnus, the system features one of the oldest known black holes, the V404 Cygni, which is nine times as big as the Sun in our solar system.
V404 Cygni has two stars around it as the black hole did not arise from a supernova, which typically kicks away outer stars in the explosion.
Instead, it was formed through another process called “direct collapse”, where the star caves in after expending all its fuel, but does not explode.

A digital arrest scam is a type of online fraud in which scammers deceive victims by impersonating law enforcement officials.
These fraudsters falsely accuse victims of criminal activities, use intimidation tactics, and demand money under the pretense of legal consequences.
Victims are pressured into making payments to avoid supposed arrests.
Working
In this scam, perpetrators pretend to be officials from agencies like the CBI, Income Tax Department, or Customs.
They initiate contact with victims through phone calls, then switch to video calls on platforms like WhatsApp or Skype to add a sense of legitimacy.
Scammers use tactics like showing a police station set-up or threatening arrest warrants, accusing victims of financial or legal violations.
They demand payments under the pretense of “clearing the victim's name” or as “security deposits” for investigations.
Once the money is transferred, the scammers disappear, leaving victims with financial losses.
About the news
Following PM Modi’s recent appeal for vigilance against the threat of “digital” arrests, investigative agencies have announced active measures to combat this growing form of cybercrime.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently submitted a charge sheet related to one such scam, while the I4C has issued a new advisory.
PM Modi’s Warning on Digital Arrest Scams
In his October 'Mann Ki Baat' address, PM Modi alerted citizens about scammers posing as law enforcement, conducting 'digital arrests' to extort funds from victims.
He advised people to "
stop, think, and take action" to safeguard themselves
ED’s Investigation and Charge Sheet Filing
ED recently filed a prosecution complaint under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against eight individuals involved in cyber scams.
Known as
'pig-butchering' scams
, stock market investment scams entice victims with promises of high returns.
They use fake websites and misleading WhatsApp groups that appear connected to reputable financial firms.
The ED detailed how fraudsters disguised themselves as officials from Customs or the CBI, falsely accusing victims of legal violations to intimidate them into transferring large sums.
Funds from victims were funneled through "mule" accounts, converted to cryptocurrency, and transferred abroad.
Key accused individuals recruited directors for shell companies and facilitated bank account openings, knowingly assisting in money laundering
Victims were manipulated through “digital arrests” under the guise of a fake “fund regularisation process.”
I4C Advisory to Citizens
I4C issued a public advisory warning against digital arrest scams.
It reminded citizens that legitimate officials do not make demands over video calls and urged people to report suspicious activity via the national cybercrime helpline (1930) or the cybercrime portal.

It aims to bring attention to the pressing issues affecting urban centres worldwide, particularly in India.
With over
40% of India’s population residing in urban areas across approximately 9,000 towns
, Indian cities face unique challenges exacerbated by rapid urbanization, socio-economic inequalities, and climate threats.
Unique Urbanisation Pathway in India:
Unlike Western nations, where urbanization followed industrialization and economic growth,
India's urban expansion is primarily "poverty-driven."
Economic distress pushes rural populations to urban areas, often without adequate infrastructure or employment opportunities.
Migration patterns highlight infrastructure gaps.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, reverse migration underscored the lack of essential services for urban residents and strained rural areas unprepared for the returning population.
Primary Challenges of Indian Urbanisation:
Outdated Spatial Planning
India's urban planning often lags behind current needs, with many plans focusing on capital growth rather than human-centric development.
Outmoded spatial plans fail to account for rising populations and housing demands.
Deindustrialization and Employment
Post-1980s deindustrialization in cities like Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Mumbai led to significant job losses, pushing displaced workers into peri-urban slums where nearly 40% of India's urban population now resides.
Employment remains mostly informal, with 90% of jobs lacking job security and adequate working conditions.
Environmental Challenges and Climate Impact:
Climate Vulnerabilities
Indian cities, particularly in the National Capital Region (NCR), experience severe air pollution, urban flooding, and the "urban heat island" effect.
Among India’s ten most polluted cities, eight are located in the NCR, leading to substantial health risks and decreased quality of life.
Urban Flooding and Extreme Heat
The increase in impervious surfaces and poor drainage systems make Indian cities prone to urban flooding.
The dense construction exacerbates heat levels, significantly impacting public health and productivity.
Social Inequality & Segregation:
Growing Inequality
Cities are witnessing widening socio-economic disparities, with luxury housing projects such as DLF's "The Dahlias" in Gurugram offering apartments starting at ₹100 crore, contrasting with millions living without basic shelter.
Community Segregation
Contrary to the notion that cities dilute social and religious differences, urban areas in India are becoming increasingly segregated along these lines, leading to community isolation and tensions.
Governance & Decentralisation Issues:
Limited Local Authority
Despite the 74th Constitutional Amendment aiming for decentralized urban governance, most Indian cities lack control over urban planning and essential functions.
Only a few cities have implemented more than three of the 18 mandated functions outlined in the 12th Schedule.
Funding Constraints
Urban areas receive minimal financial support from intergovernmental transfers, with cities allocated only 0.5% of the GDP, limiting their capacity for sustainable development and infrastructure improvements.
Conclusion:
Indian cities face complex, interwoven challenges requiring coordinated national interventions and empowered local governance to create inclusive, resilient, and sustainable urban environments.
Comprehensive solutions involving updated spatial planning, adequate resource allocation, and localized climate action are crucial to addressing these issues and ensuring a more equitable future for India’s urban population.

**********Paradox of India's Stagnant Rural Wages Amidst Economic Growth
Why in News?
The Indian economy has shown impressive growth in recent years, yet rural wages remain stagnant, especially in real terms.
Hence, there is the need to explore the dichotomy between macroeconomic growth and the subdued rise in rural wages,
examining contributing factors and potential mitigation through government schemes.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Rural Wages vs Economic Growth
Factors Behind Stagnant Rural Wages
Steps Taken to Address the Issue of Low Rural Wages
Conclusion
Rural Wages vs Economic Growth:
Economic growth overview:
India’s GDP grew at an average rate of
4.6% from 2019-20 to 2023-24
, reaching 7.8% over the last three fiscal years (April-March).
Agricultural sector growth
rates were also robust, averaging 4.2% and 3.6% for the same periods.
Wage growth data:
The Labour Bureau compiles daily wage rate data for 25 agricultural and non-agricultural occupations, collected every month from 600 sample villages spread over 20 states.
From 2019 to 2024
, rural wages grew by 5.2% annually in nominal terms; however,
adjusted for inflation, the real growth was -0.4%.
Even in the current fiscal year, wage growth remains low, h
ighlighting a disconnect between GDP growth and real wage gains.
Factors Behind Stagnant Rural Wages:
Rising female labour force participation (LFPR):
The female LFPR has risen sharply, from 24.5% in 2018-19 to 41.7% in 2023-24, with
rural female LFPR jumping to 47.6%.
According to the Economic Survey 2023-24, programs like
Ujjwala, Har Ghar Jal, and Swachh Bharat have freed up time for rural women
, enabling their entry into the workforce.
Higher workforce participation, especially among rural women, has led to a
larger labour pool, exerting downward pressure on wages
due to a supply-demand imbalance.
Shift in labour demand:
Although more women are entering the labour force,
most are finding employment in agriculture
, not higher-paying industrial jobs.
Economic growth in India has leaned towards
capital-intensive industries
that
require less labour
, further limiting wage growth in rural areas.
With more workers in agriculture, where
productivity per worker is already low
, additional labour supply only depresses wages further.
Steps Taken to Address the Issue of Low Rural Wages:
Income transfer schemes:
State initiatives:
Various state governments have introduced income support schemes targeting women, amounting to around Rs 2 lakh crore annually.
Impact of transfers:
Programs like Maharashtra’s
Ladki Bahin Yojana
provide significant financial support to women, supplementing their low wages and offering a buffer in challenging times.
Central government schemes:
The Centre’s income transfer schemes, including
Rs 6,000-per-year aid to farmer households (
PM-KISAN
) and
the free-grain scheme (
PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana
[PMGKAY]),
Also help mitigate low rural income levels.
Conclusion:
Despite substantial economic growth, rural wage growth remains subdued, with real wages barely improving.
While government interventions provide some relief,
addressing the root causes of stagnant rural wages
- such as limited labour demand in higher-paying industries and the oversupply of rural labour - is essential for achieving inclusive economic prosperity.

, regulating water flow from melting ice, which can sometimes pose challenges to
downstream communities
Glacial lakes often have a
vivid blue color
, similar to swimming pools, due to the
scattering of light
by fine rock particles (rock flour) in the water.
There are several types of glacial lakes, each formed by specific processes and glacier dynamics:
Moraine-Dammed Lakes
: Formed when
moraine debris
piles up at the end of a glacier and traps meltwater behind it. These are common and pose risks of
outburst flooding
Kettle Lakes
: This was created when a chunk of glacier ice is buried in the moraine and eventually melts, leaving a
depression
filled with water.
Cirque Lakes
: Formed in circular basins (cirques) carved by glaciers at
high elevations
. These lakes are often small and located at the glacier’s original head.
Pro-glacial Lakes
: Situated in front of the glacier, between the ice and the moraine dam. These lakes are sometimes formed when the glacier’s snout melts and deposits water in the valley.
Tarn Lakes
: Formed in depressions left behind in the cirques or basins after the glacier has completely melted.
Major Glacial Lakes in India
India’s Himalayan region is home to numerous glacial lakes, each with unique characteristics:
Gurudongmar Lake
