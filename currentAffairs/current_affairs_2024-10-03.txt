Crackdown on Civil Society and NGOs in India
Why in News?
Following the searches, the Income Tax (I-T) department recently concluded that some of the NGOs had allegedly violated provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) 2010, cancelling their FCRA licences.
This relates to the “
mismatch
” in annual returns and statements of foreign currency bank accounts and “
misutilisation
” of funds in foreign currency.

Challenges Faced by CSOs in India
Crackdown on CSOs in India
Allegation Against Some of the NGOs Working in India
Definition:
A civil society is described as
a group of like-minded people
who manage and plan activities for the
betterment of the community
, which requires a formal set up for implementing those plans and activities.
In India
, CSOs are defined as all nonprofit organisations independent from the government and the market that operate around common interests, purposes, and values.
Types of CSOs:
NGOs, CBOs, etc.
Non-government Organisations (NGOs):
CSOs are mostly synonymous with NGOs, which are professional organisations that are
privately run, not for profit, self-governing, and voluntary
They register with the government but work independently. They serve the communities that they target and
operate at different levels, from local grassroots to national and international.
They work across a range of issues such as
sanitation, housing, women’s empowerment, mental health
Community-based organisations (CBOs):
CBOs are voluntary, bottom-up, grassroots organisations located in specific communities that cater to the local needs of the areas that they work in.
Their members are also beneficiaries of the work.
Role of civil society:
They act as an intermediary between citizens and the state by representing the voices of the poor and vulnerable groups, articulating their needs, and facilitating change with and for them.
Nature of work:
Support service delivery, helps in drafting policy action plans and legislation, research and evidence, and developing and scaling innovative models of change.
CSOs in India:
Statistics on CSOs:
There is a paucity of data on civil society in India.
In 2015, after an order from the Supreme Court, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) mapped all the registered NGOs in India.
Their report in 2015–2016 disclosed 3.1 million registered NGOs in the country.
Legal and regulatory framework:
The laws govern three aspects of CSOs’ existence:
registration, taxation, and regulatory compliance.
Registration:
Governed by
the Societies Registration Act 1860, the Trusts Act 1882, the Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013.
The FCRA 2010:
It is applicable to all such non-profit organisations (NPOs),
which accept foreign contributions for their work.
The goal is to increase the transparency and accountability of NPOs.
Under it, these organisations must
Mandatorily register with the central government,
Accept these payments through the list of designated banks by the government, and
Maintain separate books of accounts for these funds.
Furthermore, the registration for foreign contributions must be renewed
every 5 years.
Activism or impact of CSOs:
The strongest area of CSOs is their
grassroots presence
, where they are
best equipped to reach the remotest areas and sections
of the country.
Their ability and experience to reach out to the most vulnerable groups are extremely valued, especially when formal institutions may fail to do so.
For example,
they have played a significant role in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in India by providing -
More direct support (
delivery of essential items
) to the affected population and
Indirect support to institutions working on recovery to strengthen their provisions and channels for the affected groups.
Challenges Faced by CSOs in India:
CSOs in India face multiple challenges.
These include -
Transparency and legitimacy
with respect to the level of information expected of them and
The degree of scrutiny
that they are subject to, specifically around funding.
Given that a high portion of financial sources are external grants and donations, this
increases the dependency of organisations and often questions their sustainability
Many grants by the government and international donors are tied to specific projects,
making it difficult for CSOs to focus on their core long-term functions
More competition
within civil society has brought a greater diversity of groups, it has led to a decline in the share of resources allocated to them.
Crackdown on CSOs in India:
For hurting economic interests:
A number of notable organisations working on environmental and social issues have faced scrutiny by India’s investigative agencies for hurting the country’s “economic interests” or “stalling” development projects.
, the FCRA licence of one of India’s oldest think tanks, the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), was cancelled recently following a year of suspension and raids from the I-T Department.
As a result of shrinking public participation:
Public consultations are a
necessary component of the environmental clearance process
for large infrastructure development projects.
Projects perceived as being of national importance or for national security – such as roads – have been made exempt from certain compliance regulations.
The crackdown on civil society organisations comes as
public participation in environmental clearance norms is facing a setback
Allegation Against Some of the NGOs Working in India:
Oxfam India:
There are allegations of activities against stated objectives.
For instance
, Oxfam India’s support for Oxfam Australia’s push to stop mining by Adani Group in Australia.
After its FCRA licence was cancelled, Oxfam tried to locate other “puppet NGOs” with valid permissions to redirect funds for causes.
CPR:
The I-T Department claims that the CPR was allegedly involved in the Hasdeo movement against coal mining in Chhattisgarh.
According to the I-T department, CPR received foreign funds of Rs 10.19 crore since 2016 for its Namati-Environmental Justice Programme
to file “litigation and complaints”
Environics Trust:
The I-T Department alleges funding for protests against JSW Utkal Steel Plant in Odisha’s Dhinkia and that Rs 1,250 each was transferred to accounts of 711 local residents in 2020.
LIFE:
LIFE Trust is being used as an instrument by (US-based NGO) Earth Justice to stall the coal mines and Thermal Power Projects.
Working in concert:
According to the I-T department, there are alleged linkages between the NGOs, which indicate that they were working in concert with each other:
, Oxfam India funded ET to mobilise communities with the help of local unions against coal industries.
However, according to these NGOs the allegation that all the NGOs were interlinked and interconnected is baseless.

**********What Special Status is Ladakh Seeking?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Federalism in India (Nature, Historical Context, 5
& 6
Schedule, Special Provisions, etc.)
Conclusion
Background:
Recently,
Sonam Wangchuk
, a well-known climate activist, was detained on the Delhi border while leading a
protest aimed at pressuring the Central government to grant Ladakh inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution
This demand has been growing in Ladakh, where people seek greater autonomy and protection for their cultural identity.
Similar demands have been made in states like
Arunachal Pradesh
Manipur
, where ethnic groups seek special provisions under the Constitution.
Asymmetrical Federalism - A Brief Overview:
India's federal structure is often referred to as
asymmetrical federalism
, which means that not all states or regions in the country enjoy the same level of autonomy.
Unlike symmetrical federations (such as the
U.S.
Australia
, where all states have equal powers),
India grants more autonomy to certain areas due to historical, cultural, or ethnic reasons
This is particularly relevant for regions with large tribal populations, where local governance and autonomy are prioritized to preserve indigenous traditions.
Historical Context - British-Era Policies:
The British colonial administration created
‘excluded’
‘partially excluded’
areas under the
Government of India Act, 1935
, to manage tribal regions separately from the rest of the country.
The Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Indian Constitution were inspired by these colonial-era policies to provide for greater autonomy in tribal regions.
Excluded areas:
These were mostly hilly regions in the northeast where local governance was heavily controlled by the British Governor.
Partially excluded areas:
These regions, now parts of states like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra, had limited intervention by provincial and central legislatures.
The goal was to allow these regions to maintain their customs and laws while being gradually integrated into the mainstream.
Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Indian Constitution:
Fifth Schedule:
of the Indian Constitution applies to areas designated as "Scheduled Areas."
These are typically regions with a significant tribal population, economic backwardness, and unique administrative challenges.
The following are key features of the Fifth Schedule:
Governance:
Tribes Advisory Councils (TAC) are established in these areas to guide state governments on matters related to tribal welfare.
Land Rights:
The Governor has the authority to regulate the transfer of tribal land and oversee money-lending businesses in these areas.
Modifications of Laws:
The Governor can direct that laws enacted by Parliament or the state legislature do not apply, or apply with modifications, in these areas to safeguard tribal interests.
Currently, ten Indian states have designated Scheduled Areas under the Fifth Schedule.
Sixth Schedule:
is more expansive in terms of the autonomy granted to tribal areas.
It applies to certain regions in
Assam
Meghalaya
Mizoram
Tripura
Here,
Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)
are formed to give greater control to local communities over governance. Key features include:
Autonomy in Governance:
ADCs can legislate on matters like land use, inheritance, marriage, and social customs, provided their laws receive approval from the Governor.
Judicial Powers:
ADCs are empowered to establish local courts to handle cases where both parties are members of Scheduled Tribes (STs).
Revenue and Taxation:
These councils can collect land revenue and impose taxes on professions, trades, and other activities.
In short, the Sixth Schedule grants more
executive, legislative, judicial, and financial powers
to local bodies, offering greater autonomy than the Fifth Schedule areas.
Special Provisions for North Eastern States:
Apart from the Fifth and Sixth Schedules, various north-eastern states enjoy special provisions under
Article 371
of the Indian Constitution. These articles safeguard local customs and give special powers to local governments. For example:
Article 371A (Nagaland)
371G (Mizoram)
protect local laws and practices, including customary law.
Article 371B (Assam)
371C (Manipur)
establish separate committees in the legislative assemblies for Tribal and Hill Areas.
These provisions are part of India’s effort to maintain the delicate balance between integrating tribal communities and preserving their unique identities.
Ladakh’s Demand for Sixth Schedule Status:
Since Ladakh became a Union Territory in 2019, local leaders and activists have consistently raised the demand for special constitutional protections under the Sixth Schedule.
Their argument is centered around the need to preserve the region's fragile ecosystem and protect the unique cultural identity of Ladakh’s people, who are predominantly tribal.
Wangchuk and other activists believe that without such protections, the region could face exploitation of its natural resources and dilution of its cultural heritage.
The demand aligns with similar calls from other regions that have significant tribal populations, such as Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Manipur.
Conclusion:
Ladakh’s demand for inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution reflects a broader desire for greater autonomy, cultural protection, and environmental preservation.
As India navigates the complexities of managing its diverse tribal regions, constitutional provisions like the Fifth and Sixth Schedules play a crucial role in safeguarding indigenous rights.
However, the implementation of these provisions and the need for further reforms remain critical to achieving true autonomy and inclusivity for tribal communities across India.

**********What is Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)?
The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer recently announced it would voluntarily withdraw its sickle cell disease therapy, Oxbryta, from worldwide markets, owing to the emergence of clinical data that links “fatal events” to the drug.
About
:
It is an
inherited blood disorder
It is marked by
flawed hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is the molecule in Red Blood Cells (RBCs) that carries oxygen to the tissues of the body.
How does it affect blood flow?
Normally
RBCs are disc-shaped
and flexible enough to move easily through the blood vessels.
People with SCD
have
atypical hemoglobin
molecules called hemoglobin S, which can
distort RBCs into a sickle, or crescent, shape.
These sickled RBCs
do not bend or move easily
and can
block blood flow
to the rest of the body.
SCD interferes with the delivery of oxygen to the tissues.
What causes it?
The cause of SCD is a
defective gene
, called a sickle cell gene.
A person will be born with
SCD only if two genes are inherited
—
one from the mother
one from the father
Symptoms
Early stage:
Extreme tiredness or fussiness from
anemia
, painfully swollen hands and feet, and
jaundice
Later stage
: Severe pain, anemia,
organ damage,
and infections.
Treatments
bone marrow transplant
(stem cell transplant) can cure SCD.
However, some treatments can help relieve symptoms, lessen complications, and prolong life.
Gene therapy
is also being explored as another potential cure.
The UK recently became the first country to approve gene therapy treatment for SCD.

**********What is solar eclipse?
An annular solar eclipse was visible in parts of South America on October 2 while a partial solar eclipse was visible in parts of South America, Antarctica, North America, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean.
About
Solar Eclipse:
It takes place when the
Moon moves in the middle of the Earth and the Sun
The
Moon blocks the light of the Sun
, either fully or partially, which casts a huge shadow on some parts of the world.
A solar eclipse is witnessed only
during the new moon
—
when the Moon and Sun are aligned on the same side of Earth.
A new moon occurs about 29.5 days because that is how long it takes the Moon to orbit Earth. It takes place only between two to five times annually.
It is because the
Moon does not orbit Earth in the same plane
as the Earth orbits the Sun. In fact, the Moon is tilted by about five degrees with respect to Earth.
As a result, most of the time when the Moon is in between the Sun and Earth, its shadow is either
too high or too low to fall on the Earth.
There are four different types of solar eclipses,
Total Solar eclipse
: It occurs when the
Moon blocks the Sun entirely
, the areas in the centre of the Moon’s shadow at the time witness a total solar eclipse.
The sky darkens and people who are in the path of a total solar eclipse can get a glimpse of the Sun’s corona — the outer atmosphere — which is usually not visible due to the bright face of the Sun.
Annular solar eclipse:
Moon passes in front of the Sun
but is at or near the farthest point from Earth.
In this scenario, the Moon covers the Sun in such a way that only the periphery of the Sun remains visible —
looking like a ring of fire.
Partial solar eclipse:
It takes place when the Moon blocks just a part of the Sun, giving it a crescent shape. During both partial and annular eclipses, the regions outside the area covered by the Moon’s umbra — the middle and the darkest part of the lunar shadow — will see a partial solar eclipse. Partial solar eclipse is the most common type of solar eclipse.
Hybrid solar eclipse
: It is the rarest type of solar eclipse and it is witnessed when an
eclipse shifts between annular and total
as the shadow of the Moon moves across the globe.
In this case, some parts of the world see a total solar eclipse, while others observe an annular solar eclipse.

**********Food safety laws in states
Why in news?
The Uttar Pradesh government has recently mandated that food establishments prominently display the names of the operator, proprietor, manager, and relevant personnel to customers.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh’s minister proposed requiring eateries and fast-food carts to display the owner’s ID. However, this proposal was disowned by the Himachal government.
Earlier, on July 22, the Supreme Court stayed similar orders issued by police in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand for the kanwar yatra,
stating that only the competent authority under the
Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSSA)
could issue such directives
. The court emphasized that the police could not take over this authority.
What’s in today’s article?
Regulations for selling food in India
Powers of State Governments Under the FSSAI
Legal Challenges to UP and Uttarakhand Directives issued earlier
FSSAI Registration for Food Businesses
Anyone wishing to operate a food business in India must register or obtain a license from the
Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
This body, established under the
, is responsible for monitoring and regulating food processing, distribution, sale, and import to ensure food safety and quality.
Registration for Small-Scale Food Businesses
According to the
Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Rules, 2011
, small-scale food businesses—including petty food manufacturers, hawkers, vendors, and stallholders—are required to register with the FSSAI.
Once the registration is approved, the petty food manufacturer receives a registration certificate and a photo identity card, which must be displayed prominently at all times within the business premises, vehicle, or cart.
Licensing for Larger Food Businesses
Operators of relatively large food businesses are required to obtain a license from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).
Similar to the registration for small-scale businesses, this license must be prominently displayed at all times within the premises where the food business is conducted.
Display of Owner's Identity and Location
In both cases—whether for small-scale food manufacturers or larger operators—the owner's identity and the establishment's location are already mandated to be displayed through the photo ID and the license issued by FSSAI.
Penalties for Operating Without a License
According to Section 63 of the FSSA, any operator conducting a food business without a valid license may face penalties of up to six months in prison and a fine of up to ₹5 lakh.
Other compliances and penalties under the FSSA
Improvement Notice
Under Section 31 of the FSSA, if a Food Business Operator (FBO) fails to comply with any provision of the Act or its regulations, the food authority can issue an Improvement Notice. This notice will detail:
Grounds for believing the FBO has failed to comply.
Required measures for compliance.
A minimum compliance period of 14 days.
Consequences of Non-Compliance
If an FBO fails to comply with the Improvement Notice:
Their licence may be suspended.
In cases of further non-compliance, the licence may be cancelled.
General Penalties
The UP directives do not specify penalties for non-compliance with the new requirements.
However, under Section 58, for contraventions without a specific penalty, fines may reach ₹2 lakh.
Repeat Offenses
If an FBO is convicted twice for the same offense (including under Section 58), they may face:
Double the penalty for the first conviction.
A daily fine that can reach up to ₹1 lakh.
Potential loss of their licence as outlined in Section 64.
Legal provision
Section 94(1)
grants state governments the authority to make rules, subject to the approval of the
Food Authority
Central Government
This allows them to carry out functions and duties assigned to them under the Act.
Rule-Making Authority
Section 94(2) outlines the specific areas where state governments can make rules:
Section 94(2)(a):
States can create rules regarding the "other functions" of the Commissioner of Food Safety as described in Section 30(2)(f), which includes a broad mandate for the Commissioner to perform additional functions as prescribed by the state government in consultation with the Food Authority.
Section 94(2)(c):
This provision allows state governments to make rules for any other matter that may need to be prescribed or regulated by the state.
Role of the Commissioner of Food Safety
The Commissioner of Food Safety, appointed by the state government under Section 30, is responsible for ensuring the efficient implementation of the FSSA and its accompanying regulations.
The specific functions outlined in Sections 30(2)(a) to (e) include conducting surveys, training programs, and approving prosecutions for offenses.
Legislative Approval Requirement
According to Section 94(3),
any rules made by the state government must be presented to the state legislature for approval as soon as possible
Allegations of Discrimination
The earlier directives from the police in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand were challenged in the Supreme Court on the grounds that they effectively forced individuals to disclose their religious and caste identities.
Petitioners argued that these
orders discriminated against citizens based on religion, violating Article 15(1) of the Constitution
, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex, and place of birth.
Concerns About Economic Boycott
The petitioners claimed that the directives could lead to the economic boycott of Muslim minorities, infringing on their right to practice any profession under Article 19(1)(g).
They also contended that the orders supported the practice of untouchability, which is banned under Article 17.
Government's Justification
In response to these challenges, the UP government stated that the recent directives, which include the installation of CCTV cameras at food establishments and a state-wide verification campaign, aim to enhance public health.
They cited reports of food adulteration incidents involving human waste and other unsanitary substances, emphasizing the need for measures to ensure food safety and protect public health in the state.

Red Sea
Escalation of Conflict in West Asia
Impact on India
Impact on shipping sector
The Red Sea is located between Africa and Asia, and is an inlet of the Indian Ocean:
South - Connects to the Indian Ocean through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden
North - Contains the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gulf of Suez, which lead to the Suez Canal
The conflict in West Asia has intensified as Iran launched missiles on Israel, with the Israeli military shifting its focus from Hamas in Gaza to the more formidable Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Recently, Iran launched a barrage of missiles on Israel overnight. Now, the analysts fear that Israel would retaliate thereby widening of the conflict in the region.
This follows the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, leading to further instability in the region.
The widening of the conflict has increased the risk of trade disruptions, as Hezbollah shares close ties with the Houthi rebels in Yemen,
who are responsible for the majority of the attacks on ships traversing the Red Sea route
Fears of Protracted Red Sea Disruption
Exporters have long been concerned about a direct conflict between Israel and Iran, fearing it would cause a prolonged disruption of the Red Sea shipping route.
India is especially vulnerable to these disruptions,
as its trade with Europe, the US, Africa, and West Asia—valued at over $400 billion in FY23—relies heavily on the Suez Canal and Red Sea routes
The involvement of Hezbollah's allies, such as the Houthi rebels in Yemen, heightens the risk of attacks on ships using this critical trade passage.
Impact on Indian Petroleum Exports
In August 2024, India's exports fell by 9%, primarily due to a sharp 38% drop in petroleum product exports, which fell to $5.95 billion from $9.54 billion in August 2023.
Rising shipping costs and the crisis in the Red Sea have led importers to seek alternative sources, impacting Indian exporters' profitability, particularly standalone refiners.
European Market Challenges
Europe, which accounts for 21% of India’s petroleum exports, has been affected by rising shipping costs.
A Crisil report from February 2024 warned that these additional costs would reduce profit margins for petroleum exports, compounding the challenges faced by Indian exporters.
India’s overall exports to the European Union increased by 6.8% this year
, but sectors like machinery, steel, gems, jewellery, and footwear have faced declines.
The rising freight costs are expected to further strain Indian industries reliant on high-volume, low-value exports, making it difficult for them to stay competitive.
Silver lining - Trade Opportunities in West Asia
Despite the conflict, India's trade with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries has grown by 17.8% between January and July 2024, according to a Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) report.
India’s exports to Iran also increased by 15.2% during this period, benefiting from the neutrality of regional players such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Qatar, who have stayed out of the conflict
Risk to India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)
The ongoing conflict in West Asia could hinder the development of the IMEC, a strategic project announced during the G20 in 2023.
The IMEC plan comprises an Eastern Corridor connecting India to the Gulf region and a Northern Corridor connecting the Gulf region to Europe.
It will include a railway and ship-rail transit network, as well as road transport routes.
The IMEC aims to reduce reliance on the Suez Canal by creating faster trade routes through a rail and ship network connecting India to the Gulf and Europe.
However, the widening conflict in the region threatens to delay or complicate the corridor’s progress, casting uncertainty over its future.
Surge in Shipping Costs Due to Longer Trade Routes
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), trade volume through the Suez Canal dropped by 50% year-over-year in early 2024, while trade transiting around the Cape of Good Hope surged by 74%.
This shift is due to disruptions in key shipping routes, particularly through the Suez Canal and Red Sea, forcing vessels to take longer paths, which has increased shipping costs by 15-20%.
These rising costs are hitting Indian exporters hard, especially those dealing in low-margin, labour-intensive goods like textiles, garments, and low-end engineering products.
Calls for an Indian Shipping Line
Indian exporters are urging the government to establish an Indian shipping line to reduce reliance on foreign firms.
The global shipping lines are seeing their profits soar amid the Red Sea crisis.
This push comes as
India’s outward remittance on transport services exceeded $109 billion in 2022
, with rising exports contributing to higher costs.
Many exporters believe an Indian shipping line would benefit MSMEs, reducing foreign shipping lines' ability to dictate terms, especially during crises.

Why in the News?
Since February this year, hundreds of copies of the Environment Ministry’s elephant census report — “Status of Elephant in India 2022-23” — have remained unreleased, with the government attributing the delay to pending census data from the Northeast.
Findings of the Elephant Census Report
Significant Drop in Population
: The report shows a
20% drop
in India’s elephant population since 2017. The Central Indian and Eastern Ghats recorded a 41% dip, with some states like
Southern West Bengal (84%), Jharkhand (68%), and Orissa (54%)
experiencing major declines.
Regional Breakdown
: The Western Ghats also saw a
decline of 18%,
particularly in Kerala, where the population
fell by 51%.
The Shivalik hills and Gangetic plains recorded only a
slight drop (2%),
while the Northeast’s data was not updated, but is expected to see a reduction when properly modeled.
Developmental Pressures
: The report identified
“mushrooming developmental projects,”
particularly unmitigated mining, linear infrastructure construction, and habitat fragmentation, as key threats to elephants.
Poaching, railway collisions,
electrocution
were other significant risks.
Fragmentation of Habitats
: The once-contiguous populations, particularly in the
Western Ghats and Central India
, are becoming increasingly fragmented due to land-use changes, such as plantations, fencing, and human encroachment.
Threats in the Northeast
: Elephants in the Northeast are under threat from a
mosaic of human habitation, plantations, mines
oil refineries.
Poaching for ivory is a serious issue in this region.
Note:
“Mushrooming developmental projects”
refers to the rapid, often
uncontrolled expansion of infrastructure and industrial activities,
such as mining, road construction, and urbanization, which disrupt ecosystems and natural habitats, impacting biodiversity.
Why Was the Report Shelved After Being Printed?
Delay in Northeast Data
: The government cited delays in completing the census in the Northeast region as the primary reason for not releasing the report.
The methodology and data collection, including
advanced techniques like DNA profiling and camera traps,
were not fully implemented in the region due to logistical challenges.
Interim Status
: The Ministry stated that the current report is an
interim version and the final report,
including Northeast data, is expected by
June 2025
. There is a reluctance to release incomplete data until a uniform methodology is applied across all regions.
What are the implications of this decline for elephant on conservation efforts?
Need for Urgent Action
: The significant decline in elephant populations, especially in the
Central and Eastern regions,
signals an urgent need for conservation strategies, including habitat restoration and strengthened protection measures.
Impact of Development
: The report emphasizes the need to
address the impacts of developmental projects,
which have severely fragmented elephant habitats, increasing human-elephant conflict and other risks such as poaching.
Reevaluation of Conservation Policies
: The findings suggest the necessity for reevaluating conservation policies to focus on
maintaining elephant corridors, mitigating the impact of infrastructure projects,
and fostering community support for conservation.
Scientific Modelling
: The shift to more sophisticated scientific modelling of elephant populations
(mark-recapture techniques)
Focus on Fragmented Landscapes
: Future conservation strategies must address the fragmentation of landscapes, particularly in critical areas like the
Eastern Ghats, Western Ghats, and the Northeast,
to reconnect elephant habitats and ensure their long-term survival.
Conclusion:
The Elephant Census Report reveals a worrying decline in populations due to habitat fragmentation and developmental pressures. Urgent action is needed to restore habitats, strengthen protection, and reevaluate conservation policies to ensure long-term elephant survival.
**********What special status is Ladakh seeking?

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related Federalism;
Why in the News?
Climate activist
Sonam Wangchuk
was detained at the Delhi border on Monday night while leading a group of protesters seeking to petition the Central government for Ladakh’s inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, along with other demands for greater autonomy for the region.
What is Asymmetrical federalism?
Asymmetrical federalism refers to a system where some regions or states within a country have
more autonomy or special provisions than others.
This contrasts with symmetrical federalism, where all states or regions have equal powers.
Example in India:
The
Indian Constitution
follows asymmetrical federalism, where certain regions like those under the
Fifth and Sixth Schedules
or specific northeastern states have special provisions and greater autonomy compared to other states.
Which are the other States seeking constitutional safeguards?
Ladakh:
The Union Territory of Ladakh has seen increasing demands for
of the Constitution to safeguard its indigenous culture and provide greater autonomy.
Arunachal Pradesh:
The state has passed a resolution seeking inclusion in the
to grant more autonomy to its tribal populations.
Manipur:
The Hill Area Committee in Manipur has also demanded inclusion in the
for its tribal areas, particularly the ‘Hill areas’.
Do the Fifth and Sixth schedules grant areas under them more autonomy?
Fifth Schedule:
Grants special protections to
‘scheduled areas’
in 10 states. These areas are governed by Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs) and Governors, who have the power to regulate land transfers, businesses, and the applicability of laws.
Sixth Schedule:
Provides
‘tribal areas’
in four northeastern states (Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura) through Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).
have more
legislative, executive,
financial powers
, including the ability to regulate land use, social customs, and taxation.
Why did the British create provisions for ‘excluded’ and ‘partially excluded’ areas?
British Policy of Isolation:
To avoid unrest and rebellion among the tribal populations, the British adopted a policy of
‘isolation’
by creating
’ areas in tribal regions under the Government of India Act, 1935.
Excluded Areas:
These were mostly in the northeastern hilly regions, where the Governor had the authority to legislate.
Partially Excluded Areas:
These included tribal regions in Central and Eastern India, where
laws from central and provincial legislatures
were applicable but with modifications, ensuring minimal interference with tribal customs and governance.
Conclusion:
The government should initiate meaningful consultations with local stakeholders in regions like Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Manipur to address concerns about cultural preservation and autonomy, ensuring that any constitutional reforms reflect the aspirations of the indigenous populations.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Food safety issues in India;
Why in the News?
The Uttar Pradesh government has mandated that all food establishments display the names and addresses of their owners and employees. In July, the Supreme Court put a hold on similar orders issued by the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
What are the regulations for selling food in India?
Licensing and Registration
: All food businesses must register with the
Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
or obtain a license, depending on their scale of operation. Small-scale vendors are classified as
“Petty Food Manufacturers”
and must register under specific rules.
Display Requirements
: Food business operators are required to prominently display their FSSAI registration certificate or license, including a
photo ID,
at their premises or vehicles to inform customers about the legitimacy of the food business.
Compliance and Penalties
: Non-compliance with the Food Safety and Standards Act (FSSA) can lead to penalties, including
fines up to Rs 5 lakh
and imprisonment for up to six months. Violators may also receive an Improvement Notice, which could result in license suspension or cancellation if not addressed.
What powers do states have to make laws in this regard?
Authority to Make Rules
Under
Section 94(1)
of the FSSA, state governments can make rules for food safety after obtaining prior approval from the FSSAI.
94(2)
specifies areas where states can legislate, such as additional functions of the Commissioner of Food Safety and other matters requiring state-level rules.
Implementation
: The Commissioner of Food Safety, appointed by the state government, is responsible for ensuring the efficient implementation of food safety regulations.
Legislative Approval
: Any rules made by the state government must be presented before the state legislature for approval
(Section 94(3)).
Can a state government’s directives under FSSA be challenged in court?
Grounds for Challenge:
Previous orders from UP and Uttarakhand were
contested on grounds
that they discriminated against individuals based on religion or caste, violating constitutional rights under
Articles 15(1) and 19(1)(g).
Judicial Precedent:
In July 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that only competent authorities under the FSSA could issue such directives, limiting police powers in this context
Way forward:
Strengthening Regulatory Framework
: There is a need to enhance the regulatory framework by clarifying the roles and responsibilities of state governments and the FSSAI.
Engaging Stakeholders and Public Awareness
: The government should engage with food business operators, consumers, and public health experts to foster better understanding and compliance with food safety regulations.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Researchers from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in collaboration with researchers from Cornell, Yale, and Columbia has uncovered how a
psychedelic drug
interacts with the brain to alleviate anxiety.
About
Psychedelic drugs are a
class of psychoactive substances
that
alter perception, mood, and cognitive processes.
These drugs often induce
hallucinations
altered states of consciousness
enhanced sensory experiences
They are typically associated with
spiritual experiences
and have historically been linked with
counterculture movements
, but they are now being studied for their potential in
medical therapies
Examples of Psychedelic Drugs:
LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide)
: Known for causing intense visual hallucinations and altering thoughts, it is one of the most potent psychedelics.
Psilocybin
: The active compound found in
magic mushrooms
, known for creating visual and auditory hallucinations, as well as a deep sense of connection to the environment.
MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)
: Often associated with recreational use, but is also being researched for its therapeutic potential, especially in treating PTSD.
DMT (Dimethyltryptamine)
: Produces powerful, short-lived hallucinatory experiences, sometimes referred to as the “spirit molecule.”
Mescaline
: Found in the
peyote cactus
, mescaline induces hallucinations and altered states of reality.
How do they work?
Psychedelics primarily affect the brain by interacting with the
serotonin system
, a network of
neurotransmitters
involved in regulating mood, perception, and cognition.
Serotonin Receptors
: Psychedelics like
psilocybin
bind to
5-HT2A receptors
, a type of serotonin receptor. This interaction leads to
altered perception
enhanced mood
Brain Connectivity
: They increase
communication between different regions of the brain
, breaking down normal patterns of activity. This leads to
heightened creativity
altered sensory experiences
, and a sense of
connectedness
How Psychedelics hold promise for treating Anxiety and Depression?
Resetting Neural Circuits
: Psychedelics may “reset” dysfunctional brain circuits, helping treat mood disorders.
Reduced Anxiety
: They reduce overthinking by dampening activity in the brain’s default mode network.
Emotional Release
: Patients experience emotional breakthroughs during psychedelic therapy sessions.
Neuroplasticity
: Psychedelics may promote adaptive brain connections, aiding in recovery from chronic stress and depression.
