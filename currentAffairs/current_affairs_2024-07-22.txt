ICJ’s observation about Israel’s occupation of West Bank and East Jerusalem
Why in news?
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) recently stated that Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem violates international law. The ICJ further asserted that Israel's presence in Palestinian territories should end as soon as possible.
Israel has occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem since the Six-Day War in 1967. Prior to this, the territories were under Jordanian control.
What’s in today’s article?
Meaning of occupation in international law
ICJ’s opinion on Israel’s occupation
About
The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations (UN).
It was established in June 1945 by the Charter of the United Nations and began work in April 1946.
The seat of the Court is at the
Peace Palace in The Hague
(Netherlands).
It is the only one of the six principal organs of the UN that is not located in New York City.
English and French
are the ICJ’s official languages.
Role
to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and
to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies.
Judges
The ICJ has
15 judges
who are elected to
nine-year terms
by the UN General Assembly and Security Council, which vote simultaneously but separately.
The president and vice-president of the court are elected for three-year terms by secret ballot.
Judges are eligible for re-election
Members and Jurisdiction
All members of the UN are automatically parties to the ICJ statute. However, this does not automatically give the ICJ jurisdiction over disputes involving them.
ICJ gets jurisdiction only if both parties consent to it
The judgment of the
ICJ is final and technically binding
on the parties to a case.
There is no provision of appeal. It can at the most, be subject to interpretation or, upon the discovery of a new fact, revision.
The ICJ has no way to ensure compliance of its orders, and its authority is derived from the willingness of countries to abide by them.
The most widely accepted definition of occupation comes from
Article 42 of the
Hague Convention (IV)
respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annex
,1907.
It states that a "territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army."
An occupation must be temporary and cannot involve transferring sovereignty to the occupying power.
Once a territory is seized, the occupying power has obligations towards the inhabitants, as outlined in the 1907 Hague regulations and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.
These obligations include providing food and medical care to the population and prohibit transferring civilian populations and using or threatening force.
Background
In December 2022, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution seeking the ICJ’s advisory opinion on the “legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.
This came well before Israel’s assault on Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023.
The recent opinion of ICJ came against this backdrop. It should be noted that the
ICJ’s opinion is not binding or enforceable
Opinion rendered by the ICJ
On prolonged occupation
The international law
does not set a specific time limit for an occupation
, so the legal status of an occupation cannot be determined by its duration.
Instead, the legality of an occupation is affected by the occupying power's "policies and practices and the manner in which they are implemented and applied on the ground.
On settlement policy
The ICJ examined Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967 and found it
violated international law
The court highlighted several issues:
The settlement policy and military measures have forced Palestinians to leave occupied territories, violating Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
This convention prohibits the transfer of the occupier's population into occupied territories.
The policy breaches Articles 46, 52, and 55 of the Hague regulations by expanding settlements through land confiscation, thus failing to protect private property, civilian objects, and the natural environment.
The policy violates Article 43 of the Hague regulations, as Israel applies its own laws to settlements and East Jerusalem, disregarding existing local laws.
ICJ noted that the policy led to violence by Israeli settlers and security forces against Palestinians, which Israel failed to prevent or punish, creating a coercive environment against Palestinians.
On annexation of Palestinian territories
The ICJ stated that annexation is the
permanent control over an occupied territory
It found that Israel's policies and practices in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are intended to be indefinite and create irreversible effects.
These policies include the maintenance and expansion of settlements, exploitation of Palestinian natural resources, proclaiming Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and applying Israeli domestic law in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
The ICJ concluded that these actions violate the prohibition of the use of force in international relations, affecting the legality of Israel's occupation.
On discriminatory legislation and measures
The court found that Israel's legislation in the occupied territories results in
systemic discrimination against Palestinians based on race, religion, or ethnic origin
This violates the International Covenants on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights 1954 and Civil and Political Rights 1954, as well as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 1965 (ICERD).
The court observed that Israel's policies maintain near-complete separation between settlers and Palestinians,
violating Article 3 of ICERD, which obligates the eradication of apartheid and racial segregation practices
On self-determination
The ICJ determined that Israel's occupation has violated Palestinians' right to self-determination.
It noted that the prolonged deprivation of this right undermines Palestinians' ability to exercise it in the future, contravening fundamental principles of international law.
On future course of action
The ICJ said that Israel is under the obligation to:
immediately end its illegal occupation,
cease new settlement activities and evacuate settlers from the occupied territories, and
make reparation to all affected people for the damage caused.
The court said that other states should not recognise the occupied territories as part of Israel, and refrain from providing aid or assistance to Israel in maintaining this occupation.

**********Rajasthan's Tribal Communities Recognized for Tackling Global Challenges at U.N. Event
Why in news?
Recently, a High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development was held under the auspices of the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
The solutions offered by indigenous tribal communities in Rajasthan to global challenges, and their role in the execution of policies were highlighted at this forum.
What’s in today’s article?
Role of Rajasthan's Tribal Communities in tackling global challenges
UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)
About
It is
one of the six principal organs
of UN which was established by UN Charter (1945)
It is responsible for the direction and coordination of the economic, social, humanitarian, and cultural activities carried out by the UN.
Decisions are taken by simple majority vote. The presidency of ECOSOC changes annually.
Members
It has 54 members which are elected for three-year terms by the General Assembly.
Four of the five permanent members of the Security Council have been continuously re-elected.
This is because they provide funding for most of ECOSOC’s budget, which is the largest of any UN subsidiary body.
Function
ECOSOC is responsible for coordinating the social and economic fields of the organization, specifically in regards to the 15 specialized agencies, the five regional commissions under the jurisdiction, the eight functional commissions.
It also serves as a central forum to discuss the international social and economic issues and formulating policy recommendations addressed to the member states and the United States system.
Background
on Sustainable Development was held at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
The UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), through its outcome on "The Future We Want", established the HLPF in 2012
The HLPF is the central platform for follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.
It was held under the auspices of the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
Theme
- ‘Reinforcing the 2030 agenda and eradicating poverty in times of multiple crises: The effective delivery of sustainable, resilient and innovative solutions’.
A ministerial declaration adopted at the forum called for renewed impetus to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Forum acknowledged the role of indigenous communities for their solutions in the context of biodiversity and ecosystems
The indigenous practices, rooted in reverence for natural and community-centric approaches, could promote sustainability and resilience, which were essential for reinforcing the 2030 agenda amid crises.
Indigenous solutions not only meet their own needs but also contribute to broader sustainability goals.
E.g., recently, various events were held in southern Rajasthan for preservation of indigenous seed varieties to restore links between crop diversity and climate resilience.
The forum emphasized that the global community is facing unprecedented crises, including climate change and socio-economic consequences, which are exacerbating challenges like economic inequality and environmental degradation.
It highlighted that the tribal communities in Rajasthan have adopted innovative approaches guided by sustainable and resilient solutions across environmental, social, cultural, and economic systems.
By drawing from the principles of swaraj (sovereignty), the tribals’ lifestyle and cultural values have led to self-sufficiency, reduced dependence on external sources, and improved agricultural practices.
The initiatives based on
seed sovereignty, soil sovereignty, food and nutrition sovereignty, water sovereignty and cultural sovereignty
had empowered tribal communities in the State to collectively overcome critical challenges.
Best practices of tribals highlighted at the forum included
the production of local seeds,
water conservation at source,
use of animals in agriculture,
checking soil erosion through mixed cropping, and
the use of uncultivated food for nutritional security.
These practices have helped tribal communities reduce their dependence on the market and survive during the difficult phases, including the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-21.

**********Patent Ecosystem in India
Why in News?
For the first time, domestic patent applications in FY24 have surpassed those from foreign applicants, largely due to a surge in applications in fields like computer science, IT, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals.
Still, foreign entities hold a significant portion of the patents awarded in India - nearly two-thirds of all applications that are approved.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is a Patent?
Domestic Patent Applications in India
Foreign Patents in India
India’s R&D Spending and its Impact
Government Initiatives to Boost Intellectual Property (IP) Ecosystem in India
A patent is an exclusive right
provided by the government to the applicant for his/her disclosed invention of an industrial product or process that must be
Novel,
Non-obvious,
Useful, and
Patentable as defined by national law.
A patent provides a technological solution to a technical challenge
The government grants legal protection to inventions for a limited time, i.e.,
20 years from the date of filing.
What is and is not patentable in India is explicitly stated in
the Indian Patents Act 1970
The Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks (CGPDTM)
is considered as the principal officer responsible for administering the patent system in India.
Domestic Patent Applications in India:
Steadily increasing since FY19
: Residents' share of all requests submitted to the patent office increased from 34% in FY19 to 53% in FY24, when it came to patent applications.
Issues with domestic patent applications:
These have
not yet translated into approvals
because of the quality of patent applications as well as the patent ecosystem in the country.
The quality of patent approval suffers from a lower number of patent examiners in the country (597 who approved over 1 lakh patents last year, whereas Germany has 821 and the US over 8,000 examiners).
Also, the trend is reflective of the fact that patents often come with
a built-in time lag due to various procedural timeliness
Foreign Patents in India:
Foreign patents approvals in India highest in any major economy globally:
According to the CGPDTM data, patent approvals (an indicator of R&D activity) continue to be skewed in favour of foreign entities, with global IT giants (Qualcomm Inc., Samsung, Huawei and Apple) taking the lead.
Patents approved for non-resident Indians and entities stood at
76.46% in 2022
, which is among the highest in any major economy globally.
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) data showed that the comparable number in the case of
China
stood at 12.87%.
Reasons for high foreign patent in India:
The wide gap between domestic and foreign patent holders
reflects the inefficiencies in India’s R&D capabilities
Lower R&D activity results from weak private investments and stagnant government spending.
This has also been fueled by
Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property
, which is a source of
90%
of the patents filed by foreign entities.
India and PCT:
In 1998, India ratified the PCT despite having any compulsion to do so.
Around 142 countries are members of PCT and it provides great ease for a multinational company (MNC) to file patents in multiple countries simultaneously.
India’s R&D Spending and its Impact:
Stagnation in India’s spending on R&D as a percentage of GDP:
As per World Bank data, it has slipped to 0.65% in 2022 (from 0.83% seen in 2008) and this is
much lower than the global average of 2.62%
This has resulted in Indian manufacturing
depending on imported machinery
, parts, and foreign technicians to fulfil export orders.
Notably, India has a
trade deficit
with 8 out of the top 10 trade partners. India’s imports in FY24 from China alone crossed $100 billion.
Government Initiatives to Boost Intellectual Property (IP) Ecosystem in India:
Scheme for Startups Intellectual Property Protection (SIPP):
The scheme is designed to promote and mentor new and emerging technologies among Startups.
It aids them in protecting and commercialising them by offering access to high-quality IP services and resources.
National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy:
It was launched in 2016 by the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry's DPIIT to promote a more innovative and imaginative Bharat.
Draft Model Guidelines on Implementation of IPR Policy for Academic Institutions:
Its mission is -
To establish an efficient, fair, and transparent administrative process for ownership control, assignment of IP rights, and
Share revenues generated by IP created and owned by the academic institution.
National Intellectual Property Awareness Mission (NIPAM):
It aims to educate 1 million students on intellectual property and its rights.

**********Govt Considers Rs 50,000 Crore Scheme for Agricultural Reforms
Why in the News?
The Central Government is considering a new scheme with an outlay of Rs 50,000 crore to incentivize states to adopt agricultural reforms.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Challenges Faced by Agriculture Sector in India
Proposal Made by NITI Aayog for Agricultural Reforms
Problems Faced by the Agriculture Sector in India:
Access to Credit & Finance:
Small farmers struggle to get affordable loans, limiting their ability to buy modern equipment, quality seeds, and fertilizers, which affects their productivity.
Small Landholdings:
Many farmers have small, fragmented plots, making it hard to use modern farming techniques and reducing productivity.
Outdated Farming Practices:
Many farmers still use traditional methods due to limited information and resistance to change, hindering the adoption of advanced techniques.
Water Scarcity & Irrigation:
Dependence on monsoon rains makes agriculture vulnerable to droughts and inconsistent rainfall.
Access to irrigation and water management is crucial, especially in areas with limited water resources.
Soil Degradation & Erosion:
Use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, along with poor land use practices, degrades soil quality, leading to reduced fertility and productivity.
Inadequate Agricultural Infrastructure:
Lack of storage, cold chain facilities, good rural roads, and market access leads to post-harvest losses and higher production costs, limiting farmers' ability to get fair prices.
Market Volatility & Price Fluctuations:
Farmers face unstable prices due to weak market links and lack of price information, making them
vulnerable to exploitation and uncertain returns.
Climate Change & Natural Disasters:
Predictable weather, climate change, and natural disasters like floods and droughts cause crop losses and increased risks for farmers.
Limited Access to Technology & Research:
Farmers have limited access to modern technologies and research, hindering the adoption of innovative practices. They need better knowledge, training, and affordable technology solutions.
Lack of Farmers’ Empowerment:
Farmers often lack a voice in policy-making, leading to initiatives that may not address their specific challenges effectively.
About NITI Aayog’s Proposal:
Proposal by NITI Aayog: Background
Nearly three years after repealing its three farm laws in November 2021, the Union government is planning a new scheme with a budget of Rs 50,000 crore to encourage states to adopt agricultural reforms.
This initiative will provide
central funding for states to implement reforms in agriculture marketing, contract farming, and land leasing
The idea for this scheme was presented by NITI Aayog officials to the Prime Minister’s Office.
The presentation, titled “
India’s Amrit Kaal: Mobilising the nation to sustain fast growth
,” covered various economic sectors.
Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and NITI Aayog are discussing this scheme as part of their broader efforts to implement significant farm sector reforms during India’s 'Amrit Kaal,' a period from 2022 to 2047.
Various reform measures under consideration
Other reforms under consideration
include passing the long-pending Seed Bill and increasing public investment in agriculture to 5% of Agriculture GVA
(Gross Value Addition).
This proposal revisits an idea suggested by the
15
Finance Commission in its 2020-21 report, which recommended performance-based incentives for states implementing agricultural reforms
States could receive financial rewards if they adopted the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing Act (2017), the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming Act (2018), and the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act (2016).
The 15
Finance Commission believed these reforms were essential to liberalize agricultural markets, promote competition, and attract private sector investment.
However, after the central government passed the three farm laws in 2020, the Commission revised its recommendations.
The Commission’s 2021-26 report emphasized
four key areas for performance-based incentives
Land lease reforms,
Sustainable water use in agriculture,
Export promotion, and
Contributing to Atmanirbhar Bharat.
It had proposed Rs 45,000 crore for states undertaking agricultural reforms during this period.
