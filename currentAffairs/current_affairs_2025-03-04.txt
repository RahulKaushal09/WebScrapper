GANGETIC DOLPHINS
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
The first estimate of Gangetic dolphins, the only riverine dolphins in India, has found 6,327 of them in the Ganga and its tributaries.
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-202357 aligncenter" decoding="async" height="143" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1-300x143.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1-300x143.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1.png 609w" width="300"/>
For the survey, researchers travelled by boat at a constant speed using acoustic hydrophones — essentially underwater microphones — that pick up sounds emitted by the dolphins. The animals are blind and rely on echolocation to communicate and move.
The Gangetic Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) is a freshwater dolphin species endemic to the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of India and Bangladesh, and the Sapta Koshi and Karnali Rivers in Nepal.
It is India’s National Aquatic Animal and plays a crucial role in the river ecosystem.
Conservation Status –
IUCN Red List: Endangered
Wildlife Protection Act, 1972: Schedule I (Highest protection)
CITES: Appendix I (Strict trade restrictions)
CMS (Bonn Convention): Appendix II
Characteristics
Blind due to poorly developed eyes; relies on echolocation for navigation and hunting.
Can only survive in freshwater and requires deep, slow-flowing rivers.
Indicator species for healthy river ecosystems.
Threats
Habitat Degradation: Dams, barrages, and pollution (industrial, agricultural, and domestic waste) disrupt their natural habitat.
Poaching: Hunted for oil and meat.
Accidental Catch: Often gets entangled in fishing nets.
Water Pollution: High levels of toxic metals, pesticides, and industrial effluents impact their survival.
Conservation Efforts in India
Project Dolphin (2020): Launched under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to protect river and marine dolphins.
Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary (Bihar): India’s only dolphin sanctuary.

VIRTUAL DIGITAL ASSETS
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
For the first time in India, the Income Tax Bill, 2025 explicitly treats Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) as property and capital assets.
The bill categorically states that VDAs, which include crypto assets, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and similar digital assets, should be considered property. This move aligns India with global practices, where digital assets are either classified as securities (like in the U.S.) or property (like in the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand).
VDAs are classified as capital assets. This means that any gains arising from their sale, transfer, or exchange will be taxed under capital gains provisions, similar to real estate, stocks, and bonds.
For example, if an individual purchases Bitcoin at ₹10 lakh and sells it for ₹20 lakh, the ₹10 lakh profit will be subject to capital gains tax — either short-term or long-term, depending on the holding period.
By treating VDAs as capital assets, the government ensures that transactions are subject to standard asset taxation principles, preventing their misuse as unregulated financial instruments.
Continuing the precedent set in 2022, the bill imposes a 30% tax on income from VDA transfers.
Unlike traditional capital assets, no deductions (other than the cost of acquisition) are allowed. This means that expenses related to mining, transaction fees, platform commissions, and gas fees cannot be deducted when calculating taxable income. For instance, if an investor buys Ethereum for ₹5 lakh and sells it for ₹7 lakh, the ₹2 lakh profit is taxed at a flat 30% — with no relief for transaction costs.
Another crucial provision is the inclusion of VDAs in undisclosed income taxation and asset seizure regulations. If an individual fails to report VDA holdings in their tax filings, they can be classified as undisclosed income and taxed accordingly.
Furthermore, Bill allows tax authorities to seize VDAs during investigations or tax raids, similar to how cash, gold, or real estate is confiscated in cases of tax evasion.
As per the bill, any entity dealing in crypto assets — including exchanges, wallet providers, and even individual traders — is required to report transactions in a prescribed format.

WORLD WILDLIFE DAY & CITES : THINGS TO KNOW
March 3 is observed each year as World Wildlife Day to highlight the importance of conserving flora and fauna.
In 2013, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) proclaimed March 3 as the UN World Wildlife Day to celebrate and raise awareness of protecting the world’s wild animals and plants. This was as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was signed in 1973 on this day.
About CITES
CITES is an international agreement aimed at ensuring that international trade in wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.
It is legally binding on the parties but does not take the place of national laws.
Currently there are 185 Parties to CITES.  India is a party to CITES since 1976.
The CITES Secretariat is administered by UNEP (The United Nations Environment Programme) and is located in Geneva, Switzerland.
The Conference of the Parties to CITES is the supreme consensus-based decision-making body of the Convention and comprises all its parties.
How does CITES work?
The species covered under CITES are listed in three Appendices, according to the degree of protection they need.
Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction. Trade in specimens of these species is permitted rarely, only in “exceptional circumstances”. Examples – Indian rhino,  Asiatic lion, Indian star tortoise.
Appendix II includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled to ensure their survival. For example, certain kinds of foxes and Hippopotamuses.
Appendix III contains species that are protected in at least one country, which has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade, like the Bengal fox or the Golden Jackal from India.
Different procedures are given category-wise to engage in the trade of species in each of the lists.

RACE FOR COPPER
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Recently, the government announced the securing of a 9,000-sq-km block to explore copper and cobalt in a region in Zambia known for high-grade deposits.
With production in domestic mines faltering, the project is a crucial step for India to establish overseas mining operations.
On February 25, the White House warned in a fact sheet that the “overreliance on foreign copper” could jeopardize U.S. With supply of copper ore tightening, China is moving to rein in smelting overcapacity – companies looking to build new smelters must secure long-term contracts with copper mines, many of which are in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Chile, and Peru.
With the demand for copper, led by electric vehicle (EV) batteries and clean energy technologies, projected to outstrip supply from mines by 2035, countries are scrambling to secure supply chains and strengthen domestic capabilities.
While more recycling and alternative battery chemistries could ease pressure on primary supply, mining remains critical to meeting global demand.
India’s overseas focus
Copper is listed as a critical mineral in India. Domestic ore production in 2023-24 was 3.78 million tonnes (mt), 8% lower than in 2018-19.
Between April and January in the current financial year, ore production by government-owned Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL), the sole domestic copper miner, was 6% lower year-on-year.
Due to stagnant domestic ore production, India’s copper concentrate imports have doubled in value terms to Rs 26,000 crore in 2023-24 from 2018-19.
While India has large copper deposits, they require extensive exploration before mining can commence. Globally it takes up to 17 years on average to operationalise a copper mine.
To meet demand in the short term, India has been looking to secure both greenfield and brownfield mineral assets in copper-rich countries such as Zambia, Chile, and the DRC.
Spotlight on Africa
The share of Africa in the production of critical minerals such as copper, lithium, and natural graphite is rising.
The continent already accounts for 70% of global cobalt production and 16% of global copper production. The DRC is on course to become the world’s second-largest copper supplier by 2030.
India has got the 9,000-sq-km block in Zambia’s Northwestern province on a government-to-government basis. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) will explore the land, which is roughly six times the size of Delhi.
Zambia is the seventh largest producer of copper in the world. (Chile, Peru and DRC are numbers 1, 2, and 3 respectively.)

**********Ferrihydrite
A recent study revealed that the red color of Mars could be due to the presence of an iron-containing mineral called ferrihydrite.
About Ferrihydrite:
It is a
poorly crystalline nanomineral
built up of about 20% (FeO4) and 80% (FeO6) polyhedra.
Formation:
It forms by
rapid oxidation and hydrolysis
, and exists in varying degrees of structure disorder.
It is one of
the initial corrosion products
in the oxidation of iron, and is the precursor to the formation of the more stable mineral
phases goethite
(α-FeO(OH)) and
hematite
(α-Fe2O3 ).
Occurrence:
It is widespread in the
soluble fraction of soils
weathered rock
In precipitates around cold and hot springs, especially those supporting iron-metabolizing bacteria; in acid mine effluent.
The iron bacteria, especially
Gallionella ferruginea
Leptothrix ochracea
Toxothrix trichogenes
create ferrihydrite as a waste product of their metabolism.
It is
known to trap water
and protect organic molecules and forms rapidly in cool water.
It forms a

**********Narwhals
In a first, scientists have studied and captured footage of the iconic narwhals of the Arctic using their tusks to hunt.
About Narwhals:
Also known as a narwhale (Monodon monoceros), it is a
medium-sized toothed whale
It has a
big horn-like tusk
gives them a very distinctive appearance.
Features:
change color as they age
. Newborns are a blue-gray, juveniles are blue-black and adults are a mottled gray. Old narwhals are nearly all white.
The tusk is,
in fact, a tooth
that
grows out of the male's upper jaw and
sensory capability
and up to 10 million nerve endings inside.
It is believed that the tusk plays a role in
competition for mates, including mating displays
It uses tusks in the wild to
investigate, manipulate and influence
the behavior of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), including delivering sufficient force with their tusks to stun and
possibly kill the fish.
Narwhals are
polygynous
and mating usually occurs from
March to May.
They give birth to a single calf and they are born tail first. The
tusks of males do not grow
until they are weaned when they are
about one year old.
Diet:
Narwhals feed on Greenland halibut, Arctic and polar cod, squid and shrimp.
Distribution:
They spend their lives in the
Arctic waters
Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia.
Threats:

Working Principle:
The working principle involves an
electrochemical reaction
where
gas is fed
into the anode,
oxidized to release protons
, which then travel through a
polymer membrane
cathode
, where they react with oxygen to produce electricity and water.
They offer an environmentally friendly solution with high power density in a compact size.
They run on hydrogen fuel, which can be stored and transported for refuelling, and require significantly less maintenance than traditional backup power sources.
Applications:
These fuel cells
provide reliable electricity
with quick start-up times and operate at relatively low temperatures, making them a viable alternative to diesel generators.
An innovative hydrogen fuel cell-based backup power solution for telecom towers,
developed using a plug-and-play model

**********Market Downturns Sting - Equities Are Widely Held and Deeply Integrated
Why in news?
The 15% drop in Nifty and Sensex over five months may not be unusual, but its impact is significant due to the growing and widespread investor base across the country.
What’s in today’s article?
Stock Market Decline: A Growing Concern for Investors
Key Reasons Behind the Recent Stock Market Crash
Equity Becomes a Mass Investment Avenue
Market Downturn and Its Economic Impact
The Nifty and Sensex have dropped around 15% in the last five months, which, while not extraordinary in scale, has deeply affected investors due to the rapid expansion of the equity culture across India.
Budget Tax Cuts and Market Sentiment
The Budget on February 1 introduced significant tax cuts, raising the rebate income limit from ₹7 lakh to ₹12 lakh, benefiting 1.75 crore taxpayers at a revenue cost of ₹1 lakh crore.
However, the expected boost to market sentiment and consumption has faded within four weeks, as benchmark indices have dropped over 5%, dampening investor confidence.
Equity Becomes a Mass Investment Option
Over the past decade, equity investments have spread beyond metros to Tier-II and smaller towns, driven largely by mutual funds.
Investor registrations on the NSE have surged fivefold to 22 crore by February 2025, with a substantial portion of MF investments coming from smaller cities.
First Major Market Downturn for Many
For newer investors who entered after the pandemic, this sustained decline is unprecedented.
With stagnant income growth, stock and MF gains were their primary wealth drivers, making the recent market downturn a significant blow to overall sentiment.
Impact of Trump’s Tariffs
US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, fueling uncertainty in global markets.
The additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, set to take effect on March 4, heightened fears of a prolonged trade conflict, contributing to market volatility.
Across-the-Board Selling Pressure
Heavy selling in mid- and small-cap stocks intensified market weakness.
The Nifty SmallCap index fell 2.09%, while the Nifty MidCap index declined 1.89%.
Sectors like Metal, Realty, Auto, and Media witnessed losses of up to 2.5%.
Persistent FII Selling
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree, offloading stocks worth Rs 556.56 crore on February 27.
FIIs have sold a total of Rs 1,13,721 crore so far in 2025, significantly pressuring the Indian stock market.
Weak Global Cues
Global markets reacted negatively to Trump’s tariff decisions. The Nikkei fell 2.81%, Kospi dropped 2.74%, and CSI 300 was down 0.6%.
Rise of Investments Beyond Major Cities
Equity investments have expanded significantly beyond India's top 110 cities.
In March 2014, assets under management (AUM) from smaller cities stood at ₹23,624 crore (2.61% of total AUM).
By December 2024, this surged to ₹12.9 lakh crore (18.6% of total AUM), with nearly one in five rupees invested now coming from these regions.
Demat Accounts Surge, Indicating Widespread Participation
The number of demat accounts grew nearly fivefold from 4.1 crore in March 2020 to 18.8 crore by January 2025, reflecting a broader investor base.
What was once an asset class for affluent, experienced investors is now a mass product, with more households directly exposed to equity markets.
Upcoming Elections in Key Growth States
With Uttar Pradesh and Bihar set for elections in the next 24 months, the growing retail investor base in these regions could have economic and political implications, especially in light of market fluctuations.
Short-Term Investors Feel the Heat
While mutual fund investors are relatively insulated due to their long-term approach, those engaged in direct stock trading, especially in futures and options, are more vulnerable.
Many short-term investors have not experienced a significant downturn before and may struggle to navigate the slump.
Impact on Spending and Consumption
If the market continues to decline or remains weak for an extended period, it could negatively affect spending habits.
A drop in net worth weakens investor sentiment, reducing their capacity and willingness to spend, which in turn may impact overall consumption in the economy.
Mid & Small Cap Investors at Higher Risk
The market downturn is likely to hit mid and small-cap stocks harder, disproportionately affecting smaller investors who have a higher share of their portfolios in these segments.
In contrast, affluent investors, with more diversified and long-term portfolios, are better positioned to withstand the volatility.

**********India, China, and the US Race To Secure Copper Supplies
Why in news?
Recently, India secured a 9,000-sq-km block in Zambia to explore copper and cobalt, crucial for overseas mining as domestic production declines.
Earlier, US had warned that overreliance on foreign copper threatens national security, defense, infrastructure, and technology.
At the same time, facing tight copper ore supply, China is restricting smelting overcapacity—new smelters must secure long-term mining contracts, mainly in DRC, Chile, and Peru. It controls 50% of global smelting and refining capacity.

Rising Demand for Copper
India’s overseas focus for copper
Africa’s Growing Role in Critical Minerals
Trump's Executive Order on Copper
China’s Efforts to Control Overcapacity
Driven by EV batteries and clean energy technologies, copper demand is projected to outstrip supply by 2035.
Countries like India, China, and the U.S. are racing to secure supply chains and boost domestic capabilities.
Copper Value Chain
Copper ore undergoes multiple processing stages:
Concentrate production
Smelting into anode
Refining into cathode (used for industrial inputs like rods, sheets, and wires).
Mining Remains Essential
Recycling and alternative battery chemistries
could help, but
primary mining
is still crucial to meet global demand.
India’s Declining Domestic Copper Production
Copper is a critical mineral for India.
Domestic ore production (2023-24): 3.78 million tonnes, 8% lower than in 2018-19.
Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) saw a 6% year-on-year decline in production (April–January 2023-24).
Rising Dependence on Imports
Copper concentrate imports doubled in value to ₹26,000 crore (2023-24) from 2018-19.
India has large copper deposits, but extensive exploration is needed before mining.
Overseas Expansion Strategy
India is securing greenfield and brownfield copper assets in Zambia, Chile, and the DRC to meet short-term demand.
These high-grade deposits and mining-friendly environments allow faster project development.
However, geopolitical risks pose challenges to overseas investments.
Africa’s share in copper, lithium, and natural graphite production is increasing.
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) produces 70% of global cobalt and 16% of global copper.
The DRC is projected to become the world’s second-largest copper supplier by 2030 (IEA report).
India’s Copper Exploration in Zambia
India secured a 9,000-sq-km block in Zambia’s Northwestern province through a government-to-government deal.
Geological Survey of India (GSI) will explore the site, which is six times the size of Delhi.
In Copperbelt province, Vedanta Group already owns a large copper mine.
Zambia ranks 7th globally in copper production
(after Chile, Peru, and the DRC).
Global Competition for Mineral Assets
Major copper producers in Zambia: First Quantum Minerals (Canada); Nonferrous Metal Mining (China, state-owned).
India’s Ministry of Mines is working through nodal officers in the DRC, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Rwanda to secure more mineral assets.
Competition for critical minerals remains intense as other countries also seek to expand their supply chains.
February 25
: President Donald Trump launched an investigation into copper imports and their impact on U.S. national security and economic stability.
The White House fact sheet emphasized copper’s role in defense, infrastructure, clean energy, EVs, and electronics.
The U.S. lags behind China in smelting and refining capacity
, despite having ample copper reserves.
The investigation aims to identify supply chain vulnerabilities and recommend tariffs, export controls, and incentives to boost domestic production.
China controls over 50% of global copper smelting but faces falling treatment and refining charges (TCRCs) and a supply-demand gap.
Excess smelting capacity has squeezed margins, making operations less viable.
Copper concentrate availability remains weak, forcing custom smelters to compete for limited supply.
According to a report, overcapacity will lead to: Lower utilization rates for smelters; Potential suspensions or closures of smelting operations; Delays in new smelting projects to restore market balance.

**********Impact of LPG Access on Rural Women’s Employment and Time Allocation
Context:
Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS) indicate
a rise in overall employment
, especially self-employment,
among rural women since 2017-18
.
A significant portion of these women are engaged as
helpers in home-based enterprises
The increase in women’s economic participation
raises the question of how they are reallocating their time.
Women’s Domestic Work and Time Use Patterns:
The 2019 Time Use Survey of India
highlights that women spend a majority of their time on cooking.
A survey in rural Indore (MP) found that women spend
over 60 hours per week on domestic work
, with 40+ hours dedicated to cooking and cleaning.
75% of rural women
rely on
firewood and cow dung for cooking
, which
increases time consumption and health risks
due to smoke inhalation.
Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and Time Savings
LPG access
significantly reduces the time spent on cooking and fuel collection.
For example,
fuel collection time is reduced:
Dung collection: 70 minutes/week saved.
Firewood collection: 10 minutes/week saved.
Other domestic chores: 20 minutes/day saved.
Total daily time saving
amounts to approximately 30 minutes. This means, households using LPG take
30 minutes less to prepare meals
compared to those relying on solid fuels.
Impact on Women’s Labour Force Participation:
Despite time savings, there is
no significant increase in income-generating activities
among women with LPG access.
The saved time is predominantly
reallocated to leisure
(20 minutes/day).
Reasons for low labour force participation:
Fuel collection is not a daily task, so time savings are not substantial.
20-30 minutes of saved time is insufficient for full-time employment.
Lack of skilled or well-paying job opportunities
in rural areas.
access to manufacturing or service-sector jobs, which give higher returns and increase the opportunity cost of women’s domestic work, is almost absent in most rural areas.
Rural female employment rate remains low (15%), mostly in
agricultural self-employment.
Low financial incentive for households to shift entirely to LPG.
Challenges in Regular LPG Usage:
PMUY has increased LPG connections, but regular usage remains low due to:
Mixed-fuel cooking practices.
Low refill rates
(average annual usage of 3 cylinders vs. the required 12 for full dependency).
Decision-making regarding LPG refills is often in the hands of men, reducing women’s bargaining power.
Recent Trends in Women’s Employment:
2024 Time Use Survey shows:
1.5 percentage point increase in women’s employment since 2019.
Women now spend 24 minutes more on employment activities.
However, the
reason
for a 20-percentage point rise in women’s self-employment (2017-18 to 2023-24) remains
unclear
Further granular data is needed
to assess whether the rise is due to real changes or methodological adjustments in PLFS surveys.
Conclusion:
LPG access improves women’s welfare but does not significantly boost employment participation.
Structural issues
such as lack of job opportunities, low skill levels, and gender-based decision-making barriers hinder meaningful economic empowerment.
Addressing these barriers requires
policy interventions beyond clean cooking initiatives
, including skill development and increased access to
flexible, well-paying jobs for rural women.

**********Australia, A Natural Partner for India’s Growth Trajectory
Context
The
relationship between Australia and India
has entered
a new era of economic and strategic cooperation,
with Australia expressing strong confidence in India’s growth trajectory.
This partnership is
built on shared economic interests, strategic alignment
, and historical ties.
recently launched New Roadmap for Australia’s Economic Engagement with India
outlines how Australia aims to support and benefit from India's rapid development.
Australia’s Confidence in India’s Economic Growth
Australia firmly believes in India's economic potential
, predicting that India will become the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.
confidence stems from India's robust economic growth
and increasing global influence.
Recognising India’s rising stature,
Australia supports India's claim for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council
, emphasising that India's growing economic power should be reflected in global decision-making.
Moreover,
the economic complementarities between the two nations serve as a foundation
for their collaboration.
Australia possesses resources
that are crucial for India’s industrial and technological advancement, while India offers a vast market for Australian goods and services.
interdependence makes Australia a natural partner
in India’s economic journey.
Australia’s Engagement with India
Launched by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, it is builds on the progress made since 2018.
It
provides a strategic plan
for further deepening trade and economic cooperation.
The impact of the
Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA)
has already been substantial, as evidenced by the rapid increase in trade between the two nations.
While India’s global exports have grown by 35% in the last five years,
its exports to Australia have surged by 66%,
indicating a strong economic synergy.
The roadmap identifies four key sectors, described as the ‘
Superhighways of Growth
,’ where India and Australia can collaborate effectively:
Clean Energy –
Australia provides essential resources such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt, which are critical for India's electric vehicle and renewable energy sectors.
Education and Skills –
Australian universities are expanding their presence in India, helping train the next generation of Indian professionals.
Agribusiness –
Enhancing trade in agricultural products and food security.
Tourism
– Promoting mutual travel and cultural exchange.
Additionally,
seven other ‘Major Economic Roads’
for cooperation have been identified: investment, technology, sports, culture and arts, resources, defence, space, and health.
By focusing on these areas,
the roadmap aims to solidify economic cooperation between the two nations.
Addressing India’s Skill Development Needs
India faces a major challenge in skilling two crore (20 million) people annually
to meet the demands of its growing economy.
Recognising this,
Australia is positioning itself as a key partner in India's skill development initiatives.
Australian universities are playing a crucial role in
this effort by setting up campuses in India, such as those in Gujarat International Finance Tech (GIFT) City and Noida, with more expected in the future.
By providing high-quality education and vocational training,
Australia is helping India create a workforce equipped for its expanding industries
, particularly in technology, manufacturing, and clean energy.
The Role of the Indian Diaspora in Strengthening Ties
One of the most significant advantages of the Australia-India partnership is the
Indian diaspora in Australia, which is over 1 million (10 lakh) strong and growing rapidly.
community acts as a cultural and economic bridge
, fostering business and government ties.
Many Indian-Australians hold leadership positions,
contributing to policy-making and economic collaboration between the two countries.
Australia recognises the potential of this ‘human bridge’ and has invested ₹22 crore in the Maitri Grants Program
, which strengthens diaspora links and supports cultural and economic initiatives.
the Centre for Australia-India Relations has been established with a funding of ₹132 crore
to enhance bilateral engagement.
The Path Ahead: Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA)
While the ECTA has significantly boosted trade,
the next step in economic engagement is the CECA,
which aims to further remove trade barriers and create a robust framework for long-term economic cooperation.
With CECA, both nations can unlock new opportunities
in investment, innovation, and business collaboration.
Conclusion
Australia’s confidence in India’s economic rise is evident in its proactive approach
to trade, education, energy, and skill development.
The New Roadmap provides a clear direction for future cooperation
, ensuring that both nations benefit from each other's strengths.
As Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated,
Australia’s relationship with India is stronger, deeper, and more consequential than it has ever been.
With the right policies and initiatives in place,
this partnership is set to reach new heights in the coming years.

**********India’s Burden of Rising Obesity, the Hefty Cost to Pay
Context
The
prevalence of obesity varies widely across states
, affecting both urban and rural populations.
Additionally,
the World Obesity Federation has identified India as having one of the highest annual increases
in childhood obesity globally.
alarming rise in obesity has severe health implications
, contributing to conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as imposing a heavy economic burden on the country.
Despite these concerns,
obesity remains an under-addressed issue in India’s public health agenda,
requiring urgent attention and policy-driven interventions.
Rising Prevalence of Obesity in India
Recent data from the
National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019-21)
indicates that nearly
one in four Indian adults
is either overweight or obese.
However, the prevalence of obesity varies significantly across states, regions, and demographic groups.
In some states, obesity rates are as low as
8%
, while in others, they exceed
50%
Both men and women in urban and rural settings are affected, although
urban populations tend to have a higher prevalence
due to lifestyle factors.
situation is even more alarming among children.
The World Obesity Federation has identified India as having one of the
steepest annual increases
in childhood obesity worldwide.
Over the past 15 years, the number of overweight and obese children in India has
doubled
, and in the last 30 years, it has
tripled
This trend is concerning as childhood obesity often leads to obesity in adulthood,
increasing the risk of chronic diseases
at an earlier age.
A nationwide study published in
The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology (2023)
estimated that among Indian adults aged 20 and above:
35 crore people
(one in three) have
abdominal obesity
25 crore people
(one in four) have
general obesity
21 crore people
(one in five) have
high levels of blood cholesterol
These figures indicate that
obesity is not only a growing problem but also a complex health issue affecting multiple aspects of well-being
, including cardiovascular health, metabolism, and overall quality of life.
Causes of the Obesity Epidemic in India
Transition from Undernutrition to Overnutrition
Historically,
India has battled malnutrition and undernutrition
, with large sections of the population suffering from food scarcity.
However, in recent years,
the country has transitioned from being a "calorie-deficient" to a "calorie-sufficient" nation
, though food distribution remains inequitable.
While many still struggle with hunger and undernutrition,
a significant portion of the population has easy access to calorie-dense foods
, leading to a paradoxical rise in obesity alongside malnutrition.
Poor Dietary Habits
increased consumption of high-fat, salt, and sugar (HFSS) foods
and ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is one of the primary drivers of obesity.
These foods, which include sugary beverages, fast food,
packaged snacks, and processed meats, are
often low in essential nutrients but high in calories.
The affordability and accessibility
of such foods have led to
an increase in unhealthy eating habits, especially among urban populations.
significant challenge is that eating healthy is becoming more expensive
than consuming junk food.
Fresh fruits, vegetables, and nutritious whole foods are often costlier
than processed, packaged, and fried foods, making it difficult for many families to maintain a balanced diet.
Sedentary Lifestyles and Lack of Physical Activity
Urbanisation has
led to drastic changes in how people live and work.
Traditional lifestyles,
which involved higher levels of physical activity,
have been replaced by sedentary habits, especially in cities.
Long hours of screen time, desk jobs,
reduced outdoor activities, and increased dependence on motorized transport have all
contributed to lower levels of physical movement.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
nearly 50% of Indians fail to meet the recommended levels of physical activity.
The lack of open spaces, parks, cycling tracks, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure in cities has further discouraged physical movement.
Health and Economic Consequences of Obesity
Increased Burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)
Diabetes:
India is home to
over 100 million diabetics
, with numbers rising due to obesity.
Cardiovascular Diseases:
High cholesterol and obesity contribute to heart disease, the leading cause of death in India.
Hypertension:
Obesity leads to high blood pressure, increasing the risk of strokes and kidney diseases.
Cancer:
Certain types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, are linked to obesity.
The increasing burden of obesity-related diseases places
immense pressure on India’s healthcare system
, requiring urgent intervention.
Economic Costs of Obesity
The Global Obesity Observatory (2019) estimated that the economic cost of obesity in India was
$28.95 billion (₹1,800 per capita),
or 1.02% of GDP.
These costs are associated with:
Higher healthcare expenditures for obesity-related diseases
Lost productivity due to obesity-related illnesses
Reduced workforce efficiency and higher absenteeism
If left unchecked,
the economic burden of obesity is projected to increase to ₹4,700 per capita by 2030
(1.57% of GDP).
growing financial strain highlights the urgent need for policy-driven solutions
to curb the obesity epidemic.
Policy and Programmatic Solutions to Tackle Obesity
Public Awareness and Education
structured public awareness campaign is needed
to reframe obesity as a chronic disease that requires prevention and management.
Educating people about the link between obesity and conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and liver disorders is crucial.
Promotion of Physical Activity
Urban planning must prioritise
active lifestyles by incorporating bicycle lanes, public parks, and open gymnasiums
to encourage physical activity.
Workplaces and schools should also facilitate exercise-friendly environments.
Regulation of Processed and Unhealthy Foods
HFSS and UPF products should be taxed at higher rates,
while subsidies should be provided for healthier food options like fruits and vegetables.
food industry should be encouraged to adopt ethical marketing practices
to reduce the appeal of unhealthy foods.
Integration of Obesity Screening in Healthcare
Regular health check-ups should include measurements of weight, height, and waist circumference.
Discussions about maintaining a healthy weight should be a routine
part of healthcare visits.
A simple guideline
, such as maintaining a waist circumference below 80 cm for women and 90 cm for men,
can help individuals track their health.
Medical Interventions and Guidelines
The availability of anti-obesity medications is increasing,
but there is a need for clear guidelines on their appropriate use.
Medical professionals must be trained to identify and treat obesity effectively.
Workplace and Community Interventions
orkplaces should promote awareness campaigns,
provide weighing scales, and encourage employees to maintain a healthy weight.
culture of regular health monitoring should be embedded i
n corporate policies.
Conclusion
rising prevalence of overweight and obesity in India poses a serious threat
to public health and economic stability.
Tackling obesity requires a collective effort from individuals,
healthcare professionals, policymakers, and businesses.
comprehensive strategy involving awareness, taxation, urban planning, healthcare screening,
medical interventions, and school programs is essential.
By taking immediate and coordinated action, India can build a healthier and more prosperous future
, ensuring that its economic growth is not undermined by preventable health crises.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of vulgar humour;
Why in the News?
Recently, the
Supreme Court of India
asked
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta
, representing the
Central Government
, to suggest
regulatory measures
to control the use of
filthy language
and
online programmes
.
What did the Supreme Court ask the Solicitor General to suggest regarding online programmes?
The Supreme Court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to propose
“regulatory measures”
“filthy language”
“vulgarity”
in online programmes.
The regulatory framework should ensure that
programmes adhere to the “known moral standards”
of Indian society while maintaining
freedom of speech and expression
These measures are intended to function as
reasonable restrictions
on free speech, focusing on
decency and morality
without imposing outright censorship. The court also sought
input from stakeholders
to facilitate a
healthy debate
on the issue.
Why did the court emphasize the need for regulatory measures on humour and vulgarity?
To Maintain Public Decency and Morality:
The court stressed the need to
uphold societal moral standards
and prevent the spread of
indecent content
under the guise of humour.
Example:
The Supreme Court remarked that humour should be
family-friendly
and using

**********What is Planetary Alignment?
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
On
February 29, 2024
, skywatchers worldwide witnessed a rare planetary alignment (parade) with
seven planets
—Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Mercury, Saturn, and Venus—
lining up in the night sky
.
occurs when multiple planets in the
Solar System
appear to line up in the sky as seen from
Earth
This phenomenon happens because planets orbit the
Sun
in a
flat, disc-shaped plane
called the
ecliptic
Although planets remain
millions of kilometers apart
, they seem to form a
straight line
from Earth’s perspective due to
optical illusion and perspective
The term
“planet parade”
is also used to describe this occurrence when multiple planets become visible in the sky at the same time.
Types of Planetary Alignments:
Conjunction
: Two or more planets appear close to each other in the sky.
Small Alignment
: Three planets align in a visible line.
Large Alignment
: Four or more planets appear aligned from Earth’s perspective.
Full Alignment
: All eight planets of the
appear in a single line (very rare).
How often do Planetary Alignments occur?
Planetary alignments are
not uncommon,
but their
rarity depends on the number of planets involved
Two- or Three-Planet Alignments
: Occur multiple times a year.
Four- or Five-Planet Alignments
: Visible every few years.
Six- or Seven-Planet Alignments
: Appear every few decades.
Full Alignment (All Eight Planets)
: Extremely rare, occurs once every 170–200 years.

**********Research team takes big step towards making a Bose Metal
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Researchers have recently discovered a potential
new state of matter
, the Bose metal, found between a regular metal and a superconductor, with evidence of this phase in
Niobium Diselenide (NbSe
₂
)
by a team of Chinese and Japanese scientists.
What is a Bose Metal?
A
is a hypothetical
anomalous metallic state
where
Cooper pairs (electron pairs) form but do not transition into a superconducting state
This state exists
between a normal metal and a superconductor
, challenging traditional theories of condensed matter physics.
In simple terms, a Bose metal is a material where:
Electrons pair up into
(like in superconductors).
However, these Cooper pairs
fail to achieve long-range coherence
, meaning the material
remains metallic
instead of becoming superconducting.
This results in
partial electrical resistance
, unlike superconductors that have
zero resistance
Recent experimental studies suggest their existence in materials like
when subjected to
specific conditions
, such as thin layers and applied magnetic fields.
Key Features:
Intermediate State
: Exists
Cooper Pair Formation
: Electrons form
, but they
don’t condense into superconductivity
Anomalous Conductivity:
Higher
than normal metals
not infinite
like superconductors.
Quantum Fluctuations
: Strong
phase fluctuations
disrupt Cooper pair coherence.
Hall Resistance Vanishing:
Indicates charge transport
by Cooper pairs
rather than individual electrons.
Observed in Thin 2D Materials:
Seen in
ultra-thin films
of superconductors under specific conditions.
