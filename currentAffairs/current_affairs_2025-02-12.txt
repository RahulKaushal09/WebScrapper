INDIA’S CITIES AS ENGINES OF GROWTH
Syllabus:
Prelims – GS 2 & GS 3
Context:
The Union Budget 2025, emphasised urban development as one of the six domains for transformative reforms. This renewed focus on urban areas points to the government’s commitment to empowering cities as a vital component of India’s development.
Background: –
By prioritising infrastructure investment, encouraging Urban Local Bodies to diversify their revenue streams, and fostering public-private partnerships, the budget lays the groundwork for greater financial autonomy and sustainable urban development.
Key takeaways
In the 2025-26 budget, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), has been allocated Rs. 96,777 crore, accounting for 1.91% of the total estimated expenditure.
In recent years, budgetary allocation for urban development has seen a steady rise — from 50,000 crore in 2021 to 79,000 crore in 2024 and 96,777 crore in 2025.
Several key schemes, such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY-Urban), which focuses on affordable urban housing; the Smart Cities Mission, which focuses on creating smart cities; and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), which focuses on water and sanitation infrastructure, are recipients of these budgetary allocations.
In recent years, allocations have also gone to urban transport projects, particularly Metro rail and Mass Rapid Transit projects. Moreover, to boost incomes for the urban poor, a revamp of the Prime Minister Street Vendors AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) – was also announced.
The budget also announced “Urban Challenge Fund”. Under this fund, proposals shall be evaluated along three categories: “Cities as growth hubs, creative redevelopment of cities, and water and sanitation projects.” The fund will finance up to 25% of the cost of bankable projects, with a stipulation that at least 50% of the project cost is sourced from bonds, bank loans, or Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).
Structuring the Urban Challenge Fund to include private enterprise participation is a signal to empower Urban Local Bodies to raise their own sources of finance to fund projects. As the analysis by PRS Legislative Research points out, the majority of ULBs’ revenue comes from central and state government grants.
Main revenue sources of ULBs
The main revenue sources of ULBs can be primarily categorised as tax and non-tax revenues. Tax revenues mainly include property tax, professional tax, and entertainment tax, while non-tax revenues include user fees such as parking fees, water supply fees, license fees, and rental income from municipal property.
For example, in the 2021-22 financial year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had 19% of its revenue from tax, 54% from fees and user charges, and the remaining from other sources of income. In comparison, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) generated 80% of its income from tax sources and the remaining 20% from other sources of income.
While large cities have a wider tax base and capacity to generate revenues, smaller cities have to rely on grants from central and state governments. For example, in 2021-22, 57% of Kochi Municipal Corporation’s revenue came from revenue grants, contributions, and subsidies.
How urban local bodies raise funds
The most prominent example of this is municipal bonds, where ULBs issue bonds. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation was one of the first ULBs in India to issue a municipal bond to service its water and sanitation projects.
ULBs can also raise loans from financial institutions such as HUDCO, the World Bank, etc., for specific projects.
A glance at the database of public-private partnership projects in India shows that at least 5-10% of the total projects are urban projects in the fields of water-sanitation and transport. These projects not only bring private finance onboard, but also facilitate expertise and capabilities from the private sector.

FOR SECOND YEAR, NO DEATH PENALTY PASSES SC TEST
Prelims – GS 2 & GS 4
Reflecting a divergence in decision-making on death penalty at different levels in the judiciary, the Supreme Court — for the second consecutive year — did not confirm a single death sentence in 2024 while trial courts awarded 139 such verdicts, according to a report by Project 39A, a criminal justice programme at the National Law University Delhi.
The SC heard six appeals in 2024 — it commuted five death sentences to life imprisonment while one was acquitted.
‘Death Penalty in India: Annual Statistics Report 2024’, states that at the end of 2024, there were 564 death row prisoners in jails across India, the highest number since 2000.
In 2024, of the 139 death sentences awarded by trial courts, 87 (62%) were imposed in murder cases and 35 (25%) in cases of murder involving sexual offences. This is a reversal from the previous year, when more death sentences were imposed in cases of murder involving sexual offences (59) than in simple murder cases (40).
The total number of death row prisoners (564 in 2024) has risen every year since 2019, when there were 378 inmates on death row. In 2024, 17 women were on death row.
The report attributes the high number of death row convicts to a trend of “high imposition of death sentences at trial courts, and the low rates of death penalty appeal disposals at High Courts”.
Under Section 366 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, and Section 407 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, death sentence proceedings must be forwarded to the High Court for confirmation before they can be executed.

SHADOW FLEET BRINGS RISK OF OIL SPILL IN THE BALTIC
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
As ageing and deficient tankers in the “Russian shadow fleet” traffic the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea, a major oil spill disaster looms, experts say.
Security analysts say Russia is operating a large “shadow fleet” of hundreds of vessels, seeking to dodge the sanctions Western nations imposed on its oil exports over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
A shadow fleet refers to a group of aging or unregistered vessels that operate outside standard maritime regulations to transport goods—especially sanctioned oil, arms, or illicit cargo—while avoiding detection and international trade restrictions.
Key Features of the Shadow Fleet:
Use of Aging & Decommissioned Ships
Many vessels in the shadow fleet are old, poorly maintained, and operate without proper safety inspections.
They are often sold by reputable shipping companies to anonymous or shell companies in opaque jurisdictions.
Frequent Flag Changes (Flag of Convenience)
These vessels frequently change their flag registrations (e.g., from Panama to Liberia) to evade tracking.
They operate under the jurisdiction of countries with lax maritime laws.
Manipulation of AIS Transponders (Ghost Ships)
Ships in the shadow fleet turn off their Automatic Identification System (AIS) to disappear from tracking systems.
This practice, known as “going dark,” is a violation of international maritime law.
Ship-to-Ship Transfers (STS Transfers) : They transfer cargo mid-sea to disguise the origin of oil or goods, making it difficult for authorities to trace their movements.
Ties to Sanctioned Nations & Illicit Trade : Countries like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela have been accused of using shadow fleets to bypass U.S. and EU sanctions.

LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS (LF)
Prelims & Mains – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Shri Jagat Prakash Nadda launched the Annual Nationwide Mass Drug Administration (MDA) Campaign for Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) Elimination.
The campaign covers 111 endemic districts across 13 States with door-to-door administration of filaria prevention medications.
Lymphatic Filariasis (Elephantiasis) is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by filarial parasites (Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori).
LF is commonly known as “Hathi Paon”.
It is transmitted by mosquitoes (Culex, Anopheles, and Aedes species).
The infection affects the lymphatic system, causing severe swelling (lymphedema), hydrocele (scrotal swelling), and elephantiasis (skin thickening & enlargement of limbs).
Acute Symptoms:
Fever, pain, swelling of lymph nodes.
Inflammation of the skin and lymphatic vessels.
Chronic Symptoms:
Permanent swelling of limbs, genitals, and breasts (Elephantiasis).
India accounts for ~40% of the global LF cases.
Government Initiatives to Eliminate LF:
The Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaign involves the supervised administration of a combination of anti-filarial medicines to all eligible individuals in LF-endemic areas, regardless of whether they show symptoms.
The goal of MDA is to reduce the spread of LF by eliminating the microscopic filarial parasites present in the bloodstream of infected individuals, thus preventing further transmission by mosquitoes.

**********What is Vancomycin?
A study led by the University of Birmingham recently found that vancomycin, a commonly used antibiotic for diarrhea, could effectively treat a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) linked to autoimmune liver disease.
About Vancomycin:
It is a
glycopeptide antibiotic
used to treat severe
but susceptible
bacterial infections such as MRSA
(methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).
It is commonly used to
treat infections in the bloodstream,
skin and soft tissues,
heart valves
(endocarditis),
bones, joints,
and certain
intestinal infections like  difficile-associated diarrhea.
However, it may cause some
serious side effects,
including
damage to
hearing and kidneys.
These side effects may be more
likely to occur in elderly patients.
will not work for colds, flu or other viral infections.
●
Mechanism of Action of Vancomycin:
It works by
interfering with the bacterial cell wall synthesis.
Bacterial cells have a rigid outer layer called the cell wall, which provides structural support and protects the cell from bursting.
Vancomycin binds to specific components in the cell wall, preventing the formation of a stable cell wall structure.
As a result, the
bacterial cell becomes weak
and more
susceptible to damage, leading to its death.

**********Gross Domestic Knowledge Product
Why in news?
The government is reviving its 2021 plan to supplement GDP with a new metric, the Gross Domestic Knowledge Product (GDKP), to measure the impact of knowledge on economic and social life.
Recently, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) held a session to discuss the conceptual framework.
GDKP would better reflect the contributions of innovation, intellectual assets, and knowledge-driven sectors to India’s economic growth.
What’s in today’s article?
Capturing the impact of knowledge on economic and social life
Challenges in Implementing GDKP
Conclusion
About Gross Domestic Knowledge Product (GDKP)
The GDKP is a proposed metric to supplement Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by capturing the contribution of
knowledge-driven sectors, intellectual assets, and innovation
to the economy.
Unlike GDP, which primarily measures economic output through production and consumption, GDKP aims to assess the impact of knowledge on economic and social development
Need for GDKP in India
The government recognizes that in an era of rapid technological advancements and digital transformation, traditional economic indicators may not fully reflect the value generated by intellectual capital, research, and innovation
Capturing the Knowledge Economy
India is experiencing growth in research, patents, software development, AI, digital services, and intellectual property.
These knowledge-driven sectors significantly contribute to economic progress but are not fully accounted for in GDP measurements.
Beyond Traditional Economic Indicators
GDP focuses on tangible goods and services but does not adequately reflect knowledge creation, education, and digital transformation.
A more holistic metric is required to understand how knowledge impacts economic and social well-being.
Aligning with Global Trends
Many advanced economies are working on alternative indicators that measure intangible assets, digital innovation, and intellectual capital.
India aims to develop a framework that aligns with these international efforts.
Policy and Investment Decisions
A well-defined GDKP could help the government formulate better policies for sectors like education, research, technology, and entrepreneurship.
It could guide investment in knowledge infrastructure, such as R&D, digital connectivity, and skill development.
Currently, Intellectual Property Products (IPP) are recorded under Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in the GDP dataset.
GFCF is the total value of assets acquired for production purposes, minus the value of assets disposed of. It's also known as investment.
Satellite Account for Knowledge Economy
Currently, discussions are underway to explore the feasibility of a
satellite account
to measure the knowledge base of the economy.
MoSPI has prior experience with
tourism, culture, ocean, and blue economy satellite accounts.
However, a framework for capturing the knowledge economy is lacking.
technical committee
will be formed to evaluate and guide the proposal.
NITI Aayog’s GDKP Proposal
The GDKP was initially proposed in 2021 by NITI Aayog, but the National Statistical Commission found that it lacked a clear methodology for data collection and computation.
It noted the need for identification of knowledge parameters and adjustments to ensure accurate reflection of outcomes.
However, due to various complexities,
after a review by NITI Aayog in August 2021, the project was shelved
Data Collection Issues
Unlike GDP, which relies on well-established economic indicators, GDKP requires new methodologies to measure knowledge output.
Data on intellectual property, research output, digital innovation, and human capital development is fragmented and difficult to quantify.
Integration with GDP
Since some aspects of knowledge contribution are already captured in GDP (e.g., Intellectual Property under Gross Fixed Capital Formation), integrating GDKP with GDP without duplication is a challenge.
Subjectivity in Measurement
The National Statistical Commission earlier noted that defining and quantifying knowledge parameters is highly subjective and requires extensive refinement.
MoSPI has acknowledged the need for a proper methodology to ensure accuracy and avoid perception-based estimations.
India’s move to explore GDKP reflects its ambition to shift from a production-based economic model to a knowledge-driven one.
While challenges exist in defining and measuring knowledge contributions, a well-structured GDKP could provide valuable insights for policymaking, investment, and long-term economic planning in an increasingly digital and innovation-led economy.

**********Addressing the Growing Threat of Forest Fires
Context
Forest fires are a growing global crisis
, exacerbated by human activities and climate change.
Recent
wildfires in Los Angeles have highlighted the devastating consequences of these disasters,
bringing attention to the urgent need for preventive measures.
However,
such concerns often emerge only after significant loss of life, property, and biodiversity.
In India, the issue is equally alarming
, with a significant portion of the country’s forests prone to fires.
The Rising Threat of Forest Fires in India
India’s forests
, vital for biodiversity conservation and community livelihoods,
are increasingly vulnerable to fires
. Reports suggest that
over 36% of the country’s forest cover is at risk.
Alarmingly,
incidents of forest fires have surged tenfold in the past two decades
, even as
overall forest cover has increased by a mere 1.12%.
States such as
Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Karnataka are among the worst affected
, facing frequent and intense fires.
Human activities are a primary cause of these fires, with
nearly 90% attributed to practices such as land clearing, slash-and-burn agriculture
, and unattended campfires.
Climate change further worsens the situation
, with rising temperatures and prolonged dry spells creating ideal conditions for wildfires to spread uncontrollably.
The Devastating Consequences of Forest Fires
Environmental Damage
loss of trees and biodiversity disrupts ecosystems and threatens endangered species.
contribute significantly to carbon emissions
, worsening global warming.
Indian forest fires
alone release an estimated 69 million tonnes of CO₂ annually.
Degradation of soil fertility
and disruption of the water cycle
affect long-term environmental stability.
Economic Losses
destruction of timber and non-timber forest products affects communities
reliant on forests for their livelihoods.
According to a 2018 report by
India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, forest degradation
, including fires, results in an annual
economic loss of approximately ₹1.74 lakh crore.
Social Disruptions
force wildlife into human settlements
, increasing human-animal conflicts.
Health hazards from smoke and air pollution
exacerbate respiratory illnesses, particularly among vulnerable populations.
Existing Policies and Their Limitations
Budget Constraints
funding for Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme (FFPMS) has fluctuated significantly
, affecting its ability to sustain long-term prevention programs.
For instance,
allocations ranged from ₹46.40 crore in 2019-2020 to as low as ₹28.25 crore in 2022-2023,
indicating inconsistent financial support.
Technological Shortcomings
Forest Fire Alert System struggles to differentiate between forest fires and other types of fires
, leading to delays in response.
lack of advanced predictive modelling and real-time data integration hampers early warning systems.
A Multi-Faceted Approach to Forest Fire Management
Strengthening Financial and Policy Support
steady and increased budget allocation
for fire prevention schemes is essential.
Policies must
prioritise long-term solutions
, including afforestation and sustainable land management practices.
Leveraging Technology for Early Detection and Response
Implementing predictive modelling
using climatic and geographic data can help identify high-risk areas.
Drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras can assist in fire detection,
damage assessment, and targeted firefighting efforts.
Data from agencies
such as the Forest Survey of India, India Meteorological Department, and Indian Space Research Organisation
should be integrated for better decision-making.
Enhancing Community Involvement
Early warning systems can be strengthened
by equipping local communities with mobile applications, toll-free helplines, and SMS-based reporting tools.
Self-help groups in states like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh already collect pine needles to reduce fire hazards
; such initiatives can be expanded.
India can learn from international models such as
Nepal’s Community Forest User Groups
Indonesia’s Fire-Free Village Program
, where local communities actively participate in fire prevention efforts.
Educating and Training Local Populations
Awareness campaigns can help change behaviours
that contribute to fire risks.
Training local youth as
forest fire scouts can create a dedicated workforce
for early detection and prevention.
Conclusion
Forest fires are not merely environmental disasters
; they have profound social and economic consequences that demand urgent action.
Addressing this issue requires collaboration between policymakers, scientists, civil society organisations, and local communities
From policy intervention and increased funding to technological advancements and community engagement,
a multi-pronged strategy is necessary to mitigate the risk of wildfires.
Only through proactive and sustained efforts
can we hope to turn the tide and protect our forests,
wildlife, and communities from the devastating impact of forest fires.

**********A Role for India in South-South Climate Cooperation
Context
The
29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) in Baku
, Azerbaijan, often termed the ‘Climate Finance COP,’
marked a significant milestone in the operationalisation of
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (PA).
India, as a major developing economy
with ambitious climate targets,
stands to benefit from these mechanisms.
However,
challenges such as financial constraints, governance issues
, and equitable benefit-sharing
remain critical.
Amid these developments,
it is crucial to explore the implications of Article 6 for India, its alignment with India’s domestic climate policies,
opportunities for international collaboration, and potential challenges that need to be addressed.
An Overview of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and Its Alignment with India’s Climate Policies
6 has the potential to meet climate ambitions through cooperative approaches
By emphasising market-based mechanisms,
COP29 has provided countries with new avenues to achieve their climate goals, particularly through cooperative approaches
such as Article 6.2, a key component of article 6 of the Paris Agreement.
This framework facilitates the transfer of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs)
between host and partner countries, thereby fostering emissions reductions, technology exchange, capacity building, and financial resource mobilisation.
India’s Climate Policies and Article 6.2
India has set ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),
including a pledge to reduce emissions intensity by 45% by 2030.
financial and technical limitations have been a significant roadblock,
with India repeatedly calling for developed nations to mobilise at least $1 trillion annually in climate finance for developing countries.
introduction of India’s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) in 2023 demonstrates a commitment
to integrating market mechanisms into national policy.
While not directly linked to Article 6.2, the CCTS provides a structured approach to carbon credit verification and tracking
, enhancing India’s readiness to engage in international carbon markets.
Furthermore,
India’s experience with mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM),
Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM), Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts), and Renewable Energy Certificates (REC)
strengthens its foundation for effective participation in Article 6.2 transactions.
Opportunities for India Under Article 6.2
Unlocking Climate Finance and Foreign Investment
One of the most significant opportunities for India under Article 6.2 is its
potential to generate large-scale climate finance by selling ITMOs
to countries that need additional emission reductions to meet their NDCs.
Given the high cost of mitigation measures in developed countries,
many of them may find it more cost-effective to purchase ITMOs from India.
This can help India attract financial resources
to fund its transition to a low-carbon economy.
ITMO transactions can further enhance investor confidence
and lead to increased funding for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other sustainable projects.
India’s CCTS, launched in 2023, can be integrated with Article 6.2 mechanisms
to create a transparent and efficient carbon market,
attracting further investments.
Accelerating Renewable Energy and Clean Technology Development
India has already made significant strides in renewable energy deployment
, with ambitious targets such as achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030.
Under Article 6.2, India can enhance its clean energy transition
by collaborating with developed nations and selling ITMOs from renewable energy projects.
Partner countries investing in India’s ITMO projects can facilitate technology transfer
in areas like solar photovoltaics, wind energy, and smart grid systems.
These advancements can drive efficiency, reduce costs, and improve energy security.
India has identified green hydrogen and sustainable aviation
as priority areas for Article 6.2 collaboration.
By securing investments
from countries like Japan, South Korea, and the EU,
India can establish itself as a global leader in these emerging technologies.
Strengthening South-South Cooperation and Leadership in the Global Carbon Market
India has the potential to
play a pivotal role in strengthening South-South cooperation under Article 6.2
by engaging in ITMO transactions with other developing countries, particularly in Africa.
Many African nations face severe climate vulnerabilities
, particularly in agriculture, water resources, and energy security.
India’s expertise in renewable energy deployment
, digital tools, and sustainable agriculture
can help these nations transition to a low-carbon economy.
India’s past collaborations with African countries
in trade, investment, and infrastructure development
provide a strong foundation for climate partnerships.
Under the principles of India-Africa engagement
outlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
India can support Africa’s clean energy transition
while securing carbon credits for its own sustainability goals.
Generating Economic and Social Co-Benefits
not only facilitate emissions reductions but also provide significant economic and social benefits.
Expanding renewable energy projects and clean technology industries will create employment opportunities,
particularly in rural areas where green jobs can support economic development.
Reducing reliance on fossil fuels can lead to improved air quality
, reducing respiratory illnesses and public health expenditures.
Investments in climate-resilient infrastructure
, such as sustainable urban transport and energy-efficient buildings,
can enhance India’s long-term sustainability.
Challenges in ITMO Transactions and Climate Finance Mechanisms
key concern is that developed countries might rely on purchasing low-cost ITMOs from India
instead of undertaking substantial domestic decarbonisation efforts.
could shift the burden of mitigation disproportionately onto India
, potentially undermining its own sustainability goals.
Another challenge is the
governance and transparency of ITMO mechanisms.
If not properly regulated, ITMO transactions could lead to inefficiencies, inequities, and potential carbon leakage
, where emissions reductions are merely shifted between regions rather than genuinely mitigated.
risk of over-reliance on carbon markets at the expense of direct emissions reductions must also be carefully managed.
The Way Forward to Address These Challenges
To address these risks
, India must incorporate strong safeguards in its ITMO agreements, ensuring equitable benefit-sharing,
robust governance, and alignment with both national and global climate ambitions.
Learning from existing mechanisms
such as Japan’s Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), where credit allocation is determined based on mutual contributions,
India can establish transparent frameworks to optimise ITMO utilisation
while safeguarding its developmental interests.
Conclusion
COP29 has reinforced the role of market-based mechanisms in advancing global climate ambitions,
with Article 6.2 emerging as a key enabler of cooperative action.
For India, this presents a significant opportunity to unlock climate finance
, enhance technological capabilities, and strengthen international partnerships.
the country must navigate the complexities of ITMO transactions carefully to avoid financial dependencies, governance pitfalls, and potential trade-offs with
its own sustainability objectives.

**********Reimagining the University - A Reflection on Higher Education in India
Context:
India established its
first universities in 1857
in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras.
Despite their crucial role
in shaping intellectual and social life,
policies on university education lack reflective discussions.
The University Grants Commission (
UGC
), established in 1953 and given statutory status in 1956,
faces criticism
for its inconsistent policies (for example, inconsistency of its stances on issues such as M.Phil, PhD, and CARE-list journals).
The debate on higher education often misses the core question:
What is the fundamental idea of a university?
The Western Legacy of Universities:
In ancient India, universities like
Nalanda and Takshashila
existed, but their models remain inadequately understood.
Modern
Indian universities have adopted
Western structures
Understanding the
historical evolution of Western universities
can inform India’s higher education policies.
The Evolution of Universities in the West:
Greek tradition and medieval universitas:
The university is
one of the oldest institutions
, alongside the army and church.
Originated in medieval Europe as "universitas,"
meaning a guild for theological studies
Transformed over time into
secular institutions
focused on
intellectual inquiry.
Socratic dialogues,
Plato’s
Academy, and
Aristotle’s
disciplinary approach shaped the idea of inquiry and knowledge.
The Humboldt model (19th century Germany):
Wilhelm von Humboldt conceptualized universities as
institutions of research and self-cultivation
through liberal arts education (this concept nation-building involved the
noble idea of Bildung
This inspired the establishment of the
University of Berlin in 1809-10
, a modern university, which became
a global reference point
This idea of a university, which went hand in hand with the formation of nation-states in Europe, was
conceived against vocational education
(of the Napoleanic period), and emphasized liberal arts and knowledge pursuit.
Other ideas in Europe:
John Henry Newman’s "The Idea of a University" in Britain reinforced universities as
spaces for universal knowledge.
Rethinking Universities for 21st-Century India:
The evolution of universities over 800 years provides insights for shaping the future.
Understanding the historical roots of concepts like research, seminars, and liberal arts education is essential.
Artificial intelligences (AI) and automation
make the idea of self-cultivation (bildung) even more critical.
Universities should foster
interdisciplinary dialogue
between sciences and humanities.
UGC’s initiatives must focus on
training teachers as knowledge-makers
rather than mere instructors.
Conclusion:
While classical ideas of universities remain relevant,
alternative modes of learning
must be explored.
The future of Indian universities should
blend historical wisdom with contemporary challenges
A well-rounded education should prioritize both
knowledge creation and self-development.
In addition to
Plato’s "Allegory of the Cave"
(people must seek the truth and not to settle for what they see in front of them as truth/reality), the university culture should be governed by
Socrates'
maxim that "
an unexamined life is not worth living

_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
India’s potential role in fostering climate cooperation between developing nations through South-South cooperation in the context of the Paris Agreement is needed for the  global solutions to tackle climate change.
How does Article 6 of the Paris Agreement benefit India in achieving its climate goals?
Carbon Markets:
Under Article 6.2, countries can trade carbon credits to meet their emissions reduction targets. India can participate in these carbon markets, generating revenue by selling surplus carbon credits earned through emission reductions in sectors like renewable energy, energy efficiency, and afforestation.
By engaging in carbon trading, India can attract foreign investments from companies in developed countries looking to offset their emissions. This can provide funding for clean energy projects, supporting India’s transition to a low-carbon economy.
Cooperative Approaches:
Article 6.4 establishes a global carbon market mechanism, similar to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol, but with improvements. India could utilize this mechanism to undertake joint projects with other countries that help reduce emissions while fostering sustainable development.
Through cooperative approaches, India can access advanced technologies, practices, and expertise from other countries, enabling its industries to adopt cleaner technologies and improve energy efficiency, contributing to its climate and development goals.
Non-Market Approaches:
Article 6.8 promotes non-market mechanisms, which focus on facilitating actions like capacity-building, finance, and knowledge sharing to address climate change. This can help India strengthen its national capabilities to implement climate policies and adapt to the impacts of climate change, particularly in vulnerable regions.
India, being highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, can benefit from non-market approaches to enhance its adaptive capacities and resilience, addressing critical sectors like agriculture, water resources, and infrastructure.
Flexibility in Meeting Targets:
The flexibility provided by Article 6 allows India to find the most cost-effective solutions for emission reductions, especially in sectors where technology deployment is expensive or challenging. It provides an opportunity to meet its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in a way that balances economic growth with environmental sustainability.
What are the potential challenges India faces in utilizing ITMOs and engaging in international climate finance?
Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) Systems:
India’s current MRV systems for tracking emissions reductions may not meet the rigorous standards required for ITMOs, which are crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability in carbon markets.
Inadequate MRV mechanisms could hinder India’s ability to accurately quantify and report emission reductions, limiting its participation in carbon trading and climate finance.
Accessing Climate Finance:
Despite being a major developing country, India faces challenges in accessing sufficient and predictable climate finance from international sources, as the global financing mechanisms often favor smaller or more vulnerable nations.
Limited access to finance can slow down India’s ability to implement large-scale climate projects, especially in sectors like renewable energy, adaptation, and infrastructure development.
Ensuring Environmental Integrity:
While ITMOs enable carbon trading, there’s a risk of “low-quality” credits or “double counting” (where emissions reductions are claimed by multiple parties), which could undermine the credibility and environmental integrity of the system.
If India is not careful in ensuring robust methodologies for generating and trading ITMOs, it might face challenges in maintaining the credibility of its climate commitments, affecting its international reputation.
Domestic Policy and Institutional Coordination:
India’s domestic policies on climate change may not be fully aligned with the requirements of international climate finance mechanisms or ITMO systems. There is also a need for better coordination among various ministries and stakeholders to implement and track climate action effectively.
Misalignment between international climate goals and domestic policies could result in inefficiencies and missed opportunities to access ITMOs and climate finance.
What are the opportunities for India under South-South cooperation via Article 6.2?
Carbon Trading with Fellow Developing Countries:
India can collaborate with neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and others in the South Asian region to work together to reduce emissions through renewable energy, afforestation, or energy efficiency programs.
India could sell any surplus carbon credits generated through its own emission reduction efforts to other developing countries that need help meeting their own NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions). This allows India to both achieve its climate goals and potentially generate revenue.
Technology and Knowledge Transfer:
India has already made significant progress in solar energy and can offer valuable lessons and technologies to fellow developing countries.
India can also help other countries develop adaptation strategies for climate change impacts, such as water management techniques, disaster preparedness, and climate-resilient infrastructure.
In return, India could receive new technologies, methods, and knowledge to enhance its own climate resilience.
Joint Ventures for Clean Energy Projects:
India can partner with other developing countries to co-develop large-scale renewable energy projects, such as solar, wind, or hydropower. Joint initiatives could be supported by carbon markets, with emission reductions which could attract investments, expertise, and improve access to clean energy technologies.
By collaborating with other developing countries, India can contribute to the development of affordable, scalable solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of developing nations.
These solutions could be implemented locally, reducing emissions and improving energy access.
Strengthening Capacity and Institutional Frameworks:
South-South cooperation can help India and other developing countries to assist in establishing frameworks for monitoring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) emissions reductions, benefiting both India and its partner countries.
India can help south countries in refining its strategies and implementing the best practices that suit their own development contexts.
Leveraging Climate Finance:
India, by engaging in South-South cooperation, could also have access to international financial instruments that make climate action more affordable.
This would be particularly beneficial in sectors where India faces challenges in scaling up clean technologies, like electric vehicles, or in regions like rural areas that require adaptation interventions.
**********Struggling with poor cyber security
Security Issues
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Cyber attack-related issues;
Why in the News?
Kaveri 2.0, a web portal launched in 2023 to make property registrations in Karnataka easier was recently hit by a DDoS attack carried out using AI-powered bots.
What is a DDoS attack?
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
is a type of cyberattack where multiple computers or bots flood a website or online service with excessive traffic, overwhelming its servers and causing it to slow down or crash.
What are the key issues with Karnataka’s response to cyber attacks, specifically the DDoS attack on Kaveri 2.0?
Lack of Proactive Cybersecurity Measures:
Despite previous cyber incidents like the
2017 WannaCry ransomware attack
and the
2019 e-procurement portal hack
, the State failed to implement robust preventive measures. The DDoS attack on Kaveri 2.0 in
December 2024 – February 2025
exposed the absence of real-time threat monitoring systems.
Poor Coordination Between Departments:
e-Governance Department
did not involve the State cyber crime police until
February 7, 2025
, despite weeks of disruption. Resistance within departments to share cybersecurity concerns with law enforcement delayed incident response, worsening the crisis.
Lack of a Dedicated Cybersecurity Infrastructure:
Karnataka lacks a
Cyber Security Operation Centre
like Maharashtra and Odisha. A
₹20 crore cybersecurity centre
, proposed in
February 2023
, was scrapped after the new government took over, leaving critical digital infrastructure vulnerable.
Government Response and Security Measures:
While the government has initiated a police probe and FIR registration under the Information Technology Act, and the Kaveri 2.0 application has been restored with enhanced security measures,
Karnataka launched a cyber security policy in 2024 to combat rising cybercrime, focusing on awareness, skill building, and industry promotion.
How have past attacks influenced the current state of cyber security?
Failure to Implement Robust Cybersecurity Measures:
Despite the
on the Karnataka State Data Centre and the
2019 e-Procurement portal hack
(₹11.5 crore stolen), the state did not establish strong preventive mechanisms.
The lack of a
dedicated Cyber Security Operation Centre
resulted in inadequate monitoring and delayed responses to threats like the recent
DDoS attack on Kaveri 2.0 (2024-25)
Persistent Coordination Gaps Between Departments:
Earlier attacks, such as the
2022 cyber attack on NIMHANS
, highlighted poor inter-departmental coordination, yet similar gaps persisted during the
Kaveri 2.0 DDoS attack
handled the crisis alone without informing the
, delaying investigative action until February 7, 2025.
Neglect of Cybersecurity Infrastructure Development:
₹20 crore Cyber Security Operation Centre
, was dropped in the
May 2023 budget revision
after a change in government.
Unlike
, which have dedicated cyber security setups, Karnataka still lacks a
real-time threat detection system
, leaving it vulnerable to repeated cyber attacks.
Why has the coordination between the e-Governance Department and the State Police been ineffective during cyber incidents?
Lack of a Unified Cybersecurity Framework:
Cyber Security Committee (2023)
is led by bureaucrats
without police representation
, unlike national-level bodies like
I4C (Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre)
NCIIPC (National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre)
This results in
fragmented decision-making
, where
cybersecurity response remains within the e-Governance Department
, sidelining law enforcement agencies.
Delayed Involvement of the Cyber Crime Police:
In the
Kaveri 2.0 DDoS attack (2024-25)
, the e-Governance Department
did not inform the State cyber crime police
until February 7, 2025—long after the attack began in
Earlier incidents like the
2022 NIMHANS cyber attack
also saw delayed police involvement, allowing attackers more time to operate.
Departmental Hesitation to Engage Law Enforcement:
Sources indicate a
reluctance within the e-Governance Department to involve the police
, possibly due to bureaucratic hurdles or fears of administrative scrutiny.
lack of trust and procedural clarity
has led to
independent firefighting efforts
rather than a
coordinated response
between technical teams and law enforcement.
Why is it crucial for the state to establish a Cyber Security Operation Centre similar to the national model?
Real-Time Threat Detection and Response:
went undetected for weeks, causing major disruptions in property registrations. A
Cyber Security Operation Centre (CSOC)
would enable
24/7 monitoring
early detection
of cyber threats.
National agencies like
use
AI-driven analytics and real-time threat intelligence
to mitigate cyber risks, a model Karnataka must adopt.
Coordinated and Rapid Incident Response:
e-Governance Department handled the Kaveri 2.0 attack alone
, only involving
cyber crime police weeks later
, delaying mitigation efforts.
A CSOC would
centralize cybersecurity efforts
, ensuring
immediate coordination between technical experts, government departments, and law enforcement agencies
to prevent prolonged disruptions.
Way forward:
Establish a Cyber Security Operation Centre (CSOC):
Revive the ₹20 crore CSOC proposal with
real-time threat monitoring, AI-driven analytics, and centralized coordination
between government agencies and law enforcement.
automated response mechanisms
to detect and neutralize cyber threats before they escalate.
Strengthen Inter-Departmental Coordination and Cybersecurity Framework:
Mandate
immediate police involvement
in cyber incidents and integrate law enforcement into
cybersecurity governance structures
like the Cyber Security Committee.
Conduct
joint cybersecurity drills
e-Governance Department, State Police, and IT experts
to improve incident response efficiency.
Mains PYQ:
What are the different elements of cyber security? Keeping in view the challenges in cyber security, examine the extent to which India has successfully developed a comprehensive National Cyber Security Strategy.

Why in the News?
Increasing the number of women in the workforce is not just about equality and it is also essential for economic growth.
What are their challenges in enabling women’s economic participation in India?
Unpaid Care Work Burden:
Women in India spend
7.2 hours per day
on unpaid domestic work, compared to
2.8 hours by men
(Time Use in India Report, 2019). This leaves them with
less time for paid employment
Example:
Many women
drop out of the workforce after marriage
due to caregiving responsibilities, particularly in rural areas where childcare facilities are scarce.
Lack of Formal Part-time Employment:
India lacks
legally regulated part-time work
, unlike OECD countries where part-time work is protected by law and provides benefits.
According to the NCAER study (2024),
57% of women prefer part-time jobs for flexibility
, but due to the absence of formal options, many take
low-wage, informal sector jobs without security
Gender Discrimination and Wage Gap:
Women in India earn
only 77% of what men earn
for the same work (World Economic Forum, Global Gender Gap Report 2023).
The
STEM sector in India has only 16% female representation
, limiting women’s access to high-paying jobs and leadership roles.
Limited Access to Safe and Affordable Transport:
safe and reliable transport
restricts women’s mobility for work, especially in cities with high crime rates against women.
A study by
Ola Mobility Institute (2022)
found that
over 50% of women in Delhi and Mumbai reject job opportunities
due to safety concerns while commuting.
Low Financial and Digital Literacy:
Women in India have lower financial and digital literacy, limiting their participation in modern, high-skilled jobs and entrepreneurship.
National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21)
, only
33% of Indian women use the Internet
, reducing their access to online job markets and digital banking.
What are the Study and Findings from the LFPR Report?
Low Female Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) in India:
India’s
Female LFPR
stands at
37%
, which is much lower than the
global average of 47%
and the
OECD average of 67%
. The
primary reasons
for this low participation include
unpaid care work, lack of formal part-time jobs, gender discrimination, and mobility constraints
Impact of Addressing Barriers on LFPR Growth:
The study used the
McCall-Mortensen job search model
to simulate the effects of policy changes. It found that
addressing two major barriers
(formalizing part-time work and redistributing unpaid care work) could
increase women’s LFPR by 6 percentage points
, from
37% to 43%
Projected Increase in LFPR:
The study found that addressing these two barriers could raise India’s female LFPR by six percentage points, increasing it from the current 37% to 43%.
Formalizing Part-Time Employment:
The study highlighted that introducing formally recognized part-time work contracts with pro-rated wages and benefits would offer women the flexibility they need.
Redistributing Unpaid Care Work:
Achieving gender equality in caregiving responsibilities, through policies like paid parental leave and investment in childcare along with cultural changes, is crucial for enabling women’s participation in the labour force.
What are the steps taken by the government?
Maternity and Childcare Support
– The
Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017
increased paid maternity leave to 26 weeks, and schemes like
PM Matru Vandana Yojana
provide financial aid to pregnant women.
Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
– Programs like
PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)
train women in various skills, while
Mudra Yojana
Stand-Up India
provide financial support for women entrepreneurs.
Workplace Safety and Legal Protections
Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013
ensures safer workplaces and the
Working Women’s Hostels Scheme
provides secure housing for working women.
Way forward:
Policy Reforms for Flexible Work and Social Security:
Introduce
formal part-time work laws
, ensuring job security and flexibility for women. Expand
affordable childcare facilities
to reduce the unpaid care work burden.
Improving Safety, Mobility, and Digital Inclusion:
Strengthen
safe public transport infrastructure
women-only commuting options
to enhance workplace accessibility. Promote
financial and digital literacy programs
, ensuring women’s participation in online job markets and entrepreneurship.

Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), or “Hathi Paon”
, is a
mosquito-borne parasitic disease
caused by
Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori
It affects the
lymphatic system
, leading to
swelling of limbs (lymphoedema) and scrotal swelling (hydrocele)
, causing
permanent disability
LF spreads through repeated
mosquito bites
, making it a
major public health challenge in tropical regions
, including
India
India aims to eliminate LF by 2027

Next two digits:
Indicate the
heading
(e.g., “06” for rice).
Last two digits:
Define the
subheading
(e.g., “30” for semi-milled or wholly milled rice).
Countries can
extend the HS Code beyond six digits
to accommodate
specific national requirements

Trade experts believe that the
introduction of an HS code
will:
Facilitate GI rice exports
, even when
general rice exports are restricted
Ensure better market access
specialty rice varieties
in global markets.
Differentiate GI-tagged rice from conventional rice exports
to prevent mislabelling.
