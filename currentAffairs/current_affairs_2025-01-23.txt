Airport Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA)
Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) recently directed the Airport Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) to give a detailed reply in writing on the criteria used to calculate User Development Fee (UDF) charged by airport operators, the total revenue earned and and how it is utilised among other things.
About
:
AERA is a
statutory body
constituted under the
Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India Act, 2008.
It was set up on the
recommendations of the Naresh Chandra Committee
to prepare the road map for the civil aviation sector, which can take care of the interests of the service providers as well as those of the consumers.
It is an
independent regulatory body
tasked with
overseeing the economic regulation of major airports
in India.
Headquarters: Delhi
Function
: It
regulates tariffs and other charges
(development fee and passenger service fee)
for aeronautical services
(air traffic management, landing, and parking of aircraft, ground handling services)
at major airports
For the remaining airports, tariffs are determined by the
Airports Authority of India
(AAI).
Its
main objectives
include
creating a level playing field
, fostering healthy competition among major airports,
promoting investment in airport
facilities, and regulating tariffs for aeronautical services.
Major airports:
The 2008 Act designates an airport as a major airport if it has an annual passenger traffic of at least 15 lakhs.
An amendment to the act in 2019 increased this threshold to
35 lakh annual passengers.

**********Chandra X-Ray Observatory
An international team of researchers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory has discovered a bizarre black hole that may provide insights into the genesis and growth of supermassive black holes.
About Chandra X-Ray Observatory:
It is one of
NASA's premier space telescopes
specially designed to
detect X-ray emission
from very hot regions of the Universe
such as exploded stars, clusters of galaxies, and matter around black holes.
It was
launched on July 23, 1999,
aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-93).
It is
part of NASA's ﬂeet of "Great Observatories
" along with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitizer Space Telescope and the now deorbited Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.
Because
X-rays are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere
Chandra must orbit above it
, up to an altitude of 139,000 km (86,500 mi) in space.
It is the
world's most powerful X-ray telescope
. It has
eight-times greater resolution
and is able to detect sources more than 20-times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope.
Chandra allows scientists from around the world to obtain X-ray images of exotic environments to
help understand the structure and evolution of the universe

**********Mount Ibu
Mount Ibu in eastern Indonesia has erupted at least a thousand times this month, according to an official report.
About Mount Ibu:
It is an
active volcano
located in
Halmahera Island, Indonesia
It is a 1,325-meter (4,347-foot)
stratovolcano
with a truncated summit and a number of large nested summit craters.
It has a
history of frequent eruptions
, with most activity involving lava flows, ash plumes, and pyroclastic activity.
What are Stratovolcanoes?
Stratovolcanoes, also called
composite volcanoes
, are typically
steep-sided, symmetrical cones
built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, and other eruptive products.
Unlike flat shield volcanoes, they have
higher peaks.
They are
typically found above subduction zones
, and they are often part of large volcanically active regions, such as
the Ring of Fire
that frames much of the Pacific Ocean.
Strato Volcanoes comprise the
largest percentage (~60%) of the Earth's
individual
formed from viscous, sticky lava
that does not flow easily.
The lava therefore
builds up around the vent,
forming a volcano with steep sides.
Stratovolcanoes are more likely to
produce explosive eruptions
due to gas building up in the viscous magma.
usually about half-half lava and pyroclastic material
, and the layering of these products gives them their other common name of composite volcanoes.
Andesite
(named after the Andes Mountains) is perhaps the
most common rock type
of stratovolcanoes, but stratovolcanoes also erupt a wide range of different rocks in different tectonic settings.
Most stratovolcanoes
have a crater at the summit containing a central vent
or a clustered group of vents.

**********Crosspathy in India
Why in the News?
The Maharashtra Food & Drugs Administration has, in a recent directive, allowed homeopathic practitioners, who have completed a certificate course in modern pharmacology, to prescribe allopathic medications.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Crosspathy (Meaning, Legal & Regulatory Framework, Reasons, Challenges, etc.)
News Summary (Context, Controversy, Implications, etc.)
Crosspathy in India:
Crosspathy refers to the practice where medical practitioners trained in one system of medicine (e.g., Ayurveda, Homeopathy, or Unani) prescribe medicines or perform treatments from another system (primarily Allopathy, or modern medicine).
This practice is a significant issue in India's healthcare sector due to its implications for patient safety, legal frameworks, and medical ethics.
Legal and Regulatory Framework:
Permissibility
Crosspathy is generally deemed illegal unless explicitly authorized by state laws or special government orders.
Judicial Rulings
The Supreme Court of India has ruled that practicing medicine outside one’s expertise without explicit authorization amounts to
medical negligence
Crosspathy practitioners have faced legal actions under the Indian Medical Council Act and other state-specific medical laws.
Reasons Behind Crosspathy in India:
Doctor Shortages
India faces a critical shortage of allopathic doctors, especially in rural areas, with an 80% shortfall of specialists in Community Health Centres (CHCs) as of 2022-23.
AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) practitioners are often utilized to fill this gap.
Policy Gaps
Some states have allowed limited crosspathy to address accessibility challenges, such as in Maharashtra and Goa.
Economic Factors
Patients in rural areas often cannot afford specialist doctors or urban healthcare facilities, making AYUSH practitioners a more accessible option.
Challenges & Criticism:
Patient Safety
Crosspathy practitioners may lack comprehensive training in modern medicine, increasing risks of incorrect diagnoses, improper prescriptions, and complications.
Legal Ambiguity
Conflicting laws and court rulings create confusion about what constitutes permissible crosspathy.
Regulatory oversight is often weak, particularly in rural areas.
Professional Conflicts
The Indian Medical Association (IMA) strongly opposes crosspathy, citing it as a dilution of healthcare standards.
News Summary:
The Maharashtra Food & Drugs Administration (FDA) has permitted homeopathic practitioners with a certificate in modern pharmacology to prescribe allopathic medicines.
This move aims to address challenges in healthcare delivery but has invited strong opposition from the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and others.
Background of the Directive:
In 2014, the Maharashtra government redefined “registered medical practitioner” under the Maharashtra Medical Council Act to include certified homeopathic practitioners.
A directive in late 2024 clarified that chemists must honour prescriptions by these practitioners, resolving confusion regarding their authority.
Controversies Surrounding Prescriptions:
IMA’s Opposition
The IMA labelled the move as "crosspathy," stating it undermines patient safety.
Critics argue that a short pharmacology course cannot substitute for the rigorous MBBS training required for modern medicine.
Judicial Challenges
A 2017 notification permitting homeopaths to practice allopathy was stayed by the Bombay High Court. The new directive contradicts this ruling.
Past Supreme Court rulings have labelled cross-system practice as medical negligence unless explicitly authorized.
Government’s Rationale:
The directive aims to address India’s acute shortage of doctors, particularly in rural areas. According to a 2022-23 report, there is an 80% shortfall of specialist doctors in rural health centres.
With over 13 lakh registered allopathic doctors and 5.65 lakh AYUSH practitioners, the government seeks to utilize alternative practitioners to bridge healthcare gaps.
Implications for the Move:
For Patients
Concerns about the safety and efficacy of treatments prescribed by non-MBBS practitioners.
Potential risks of medical negligence in rural and underserved areas.
For the Healthcare System
Challenges in regulating prescribing practices, particularly in rural settings.
Dilution of general practice standards, potentially weakening India’s already strained healthcare infrastructure.
For Policy and Governance
Highlights the urgent need for structural reforms, better rural incentives, and improved working conditions for MBBS graduates.
Conclusion:
Maharashtra’s directive represents a critical juncture in healthcare policy. While the intention to bridge healthcare gaps is commendable, the implementation raises ethical, legal, and practical questions.
Resolving these challenges requires a balanced approach that prioritizes patient safety, respects medical standards, and addresses workforce shortages sustainably.

**********Punjab Farmers’ Agitation - Balancing Reforms with Farmer Consent
Context:
Punjab saw a breakthrough in the ongoing farmers' agitation when farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal ended his 54-day fast, agreeing to talks with the central government.
This movement, reminiscent of the earlier protests against the now-repealed farm laws, raises
critical issues
around
MSP, agricultural reforms, and farmer unity
Background and Context of the Punjab Farmers’ Agitation:
From SKM to SKM (non-political) - Evolution of protests:
The protest, led by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha, began in February 2023.
It gained momentum in November 2024 when Dallewal, a 66-year-old leader and political science postgraduate,
initiated a hunger strike
The movement stems from
dissatisfaction with the National Policy Framework
on agricultural marketing, perceived as an attempt to reintroduce repealed farm laws.
Key differences from the 2020-21 agitation:
The current agitation
lacks the pan-state support
seen in the earlier SKM-led protests.
Urban-rural divides
have surfaced, with urban traders resisting bandh calls, and
women’s participation
at the border points being
minimal
Key Issues and Demands of the Farmers’ Agitation:
13-point charter of demands:
The protest revolves around demands critical to Punjab’s agricultural and economic landscape:
Legal guarantee of
Minimum Support Price (MSP)
for crops based on the Swaminathan formula.
Waiver of farm loans.
Monthly pension of ₹10,000 for farmers above 60.
India’s withdrawal from WTO.
The debate on MSP:
Supporters’ argument:
MSP guarantees could promote crop diversification and fair pricing.
Critics’ warning:
It may backfire, leading to limited wheat and paddy procurement by the Centre, harming Punjab's agrarian economy.
Challenges in Unity and Governance of the Farmers’ Agitation:
Fragmentation within farmer unions:
SKM's non-participation due to
past differences
with Dallewal’s Bharatiya Kisan Union [Sidhupur (BKU)] and Sarwan Singh Pandher’s Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC).
Speculation of discord arose when KMSC’s Sarwan Singh Pandher
questioned Dallewal’s decision to negotiate.
Political manipulation and policy gaps:
Farmers are viewed as pawns in political agendas.
Punjab lacks substantial progress in diversification, cold chain infrastructure, food processing units, or effective Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs).
Impact of the Agitation:
Public inconvenience:
The protests led to border closures and disruptions, forcing commuters onto longer routes.
Unlike the 2020-21 protests, this agitation created friction between farmers and urban dwellers.
Struggles in achieving resolution:
Despite earlier promises, such as MSP guarantees for pulses, little progress has been made.
The upcoming talks on February 14 offer a critical opportunity for a resolution.
Conclusion:
While the agitation has reignited discussions on MSP and agricultural reforms, a lasting solution requires
political will, stakeholder unity,
and reforms implemented with
farmer consent
Punjab’s agricultural future hinges on
addressing structural inefficiencies
while safeguarding the interests of its farmers.

**********China’s Moves Must Recast India’s Critical Minerals Push
Context
In the rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape,
critical minerals have emerged as a fulcrum of international economic diplomacy.
These essential resources
underpin technologies across aerospace, semiconductors, batteries, and advanced electronics,
placing them at the centre of global strategic competition.
Recent actions by China
and the responses they have elicited
highlight the importance of these minerals and underscore the challenges and opportunities
they present for nations such as India.
China's Strategic Leverage in Critical Minerals
On January 2, 2025,
China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM)
expanded its export control list to include 28 U.S. entities,
restricting their access to dual-use export-controlled items.
Among the key items are minerals like tungsten, gallium, magnesium, beryllium, hafnium, and lithium-6
, essential for high-tech industries.
This
move reflects a strategic approach by China,
which has historically weaponized its critical mineral exports to assert influence over its geopolitical rivals.
China’s actions are calculated
and constrained by two factors:
its reliance on imported raw materials and the need to protect its domestic industrial ecosystem.
dual strategy has been evident in actions such as the rare earth minerals
embargo against Japan in 2010, restrictions on antimony, gallium, and germanium exports, and a December 2023 ban on rare earth extraction technologies.
These moves demonstrate a deliberate balancing act
, leveraging critical minerals as both a tool of influence and a pillar of its domestic economy.
India’s Challenges in Domestic Mineral Market
Underdeveloped Exploration Infrastructure
A major impediment to India’s critical mineral strategy is
the lack of advanced exploration infrastructure.
Despite the identification of potential mineral-rich zones,
the country’s exploration activities remain at nascent stages, classified under preliminary categories (G3 or G4).
This creates uncertainty for investors, who demand detailed geological data to assess commercial viability.
Ineffective Market Engagement
India’s auctioning processes for mineral blocks have faced limited interest from private players
, both domestic and foreign.
For example,
the much-publicised discovery of lithium reserves in Jammu and Kashmir has not translated into active bidding
or operational development.
The absence of investor enthusiasm points to deeper issues, including policy ambiguities and an unattractive risk-reward ratio.
Regulatory and Fiscal Gaps
Although the government has taken steps to reform mineral policy, regulatory hurdles persist.
classification of resources and delays in granting licenses often deter investors.
Furthermore, the reimbursement model for exploration expenditures, which only provides incentives post-production, fails to address the significant upfront costs that private firms must bear.
Dependence on Imports
Despite efforts to develop domestic capacities,
India remains heavily reliant on imports for critical minerals.
This dependence not only exposes the country to geopolitical risks but also
raises concerns about the sustainability of its industrial growth.
India’s Opportunities for Growth and Development of Mineral Sector
Strategic Resource Potential
India’s geological landscape holds
significant untapped potential for critical minerals.
Discoveries like the lithium deposits in Jammu and Kashmir signal the possibility of reducing import dependence
and bolstering domestic production.
Such reserves could play a pivotal role in supporting India's clean energy transition and emerging EV sector.
Policy Reforms and Technological Innovation
Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2023,
marks a positive shift in India’s mineral policy framework.
By introducing exploration licenses and lifting restrictive classifications on certain minerals,
the government has opened avenues for private and foreign participation.
These reforms, coupled with advanced technologies like remote sensing and AI-driven geological surveys, could accelerate resource discovery and extraction.
Global Alliances for Critical Mineral Security
India’s participation in international collaborations
, such as its partnership with Australia for lithium and rare earth supplies,
highlights a proactive approach to securing critical mineral resources.
Leveraging strategic alliances and foreign investments through bodies
like Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. (KABIL)
can help India diversify its supply chains and reduce dependence on hostile or unreliable sources.
Economic and Industrial Transformation
Developing a robust critical mineral sector offers transformative potential
for India’s economy.
Beyond reducing import dependency,
a well-structured mineral industry could drive employment, technological advancement, and value-added manufacturing
, particularly in sectors like electronics, renewable energy, and defence.
Reforms and Impacts and the Role of Fiscal Incentives
One of the key reforms in the 2023 amendments is
the introduction of an exploration license designed to attract specialised resource exploration agencies
, including foreign companies.
allows firms to focus on reconnaissance and prospecting
rather than committing to full-scale mining operations upfront.
Further, the promise
to reimburse 50% of exploration costs upon the commencement of mining offers a mechanism to de-risk early-stage investments.
However, these reforms have yet to yield substantial results.
Foreign participation remains sparse,
and auctioning for mining licenses has stagnated.
significant bottleneck is the outdated resource classification system,
which leaves prospective bidders uncertain about the commercial viability of mineral blocks.
Many auctioned blocks are in preliminary exploration stages (G3 or G4),
which deters investment due to insufficient geological data.
The Role of Fiscal Incentives
Robust exploration data is critical
to mitigating information asymmetry between mining companies and the government.
Without detailed geological surveys, bidders are likely to discount their offers
or abstain entirely, leading to suboptimal auction outcomes.
To address this,
India could adopt a model similar to its approach in semiconductor fabrication,
where substantial upfront fiscal incentives are offered.
Providing direct capital support during the exploration phase,
rather than reimbursing costs post-production,
could attract greater participation and unlock downstream value in mining and exports.
The Way Forward: Striking a Balance
India stands at a critical juncture
where addressing its challenges in mineral exploration and production could unlock tremendous opportunities.
To achieve this,
policymakers must focus on bridging information gaps through detailed geological surveys,
offering upfront fiscal incentives to de-risk investments, and creating a stable regulatory environment.
These steps, combined with leveraging global partnerships, can enable India to emerge as a significant player
in the global critical minerals market.
Conclusion
The global competition for critical minerals is reshaping international economic strategies, with China leveraging its dominance
and nations like India grappling with systemic challenges.
While
India has initiated promising reforms, their success hinges on overcoming information gaps
and incentivising private-sector participation.
embracing a proactive, investment-driven approach
to mineral exploration,
India can transform its critical mineral sector into a cornerstone of its economic and technological aspirations.

**********It’s Russian Roulette in the Skies
Context
Over the past century,
aviation has transformed the way we connect across the globe
, however, as
history has shown, this progress is not without risk.
The
issue of civilian aircraft being shot down
, often due to misidentification,
poses a significant threat to aviation safety.
Therefore,
it is important to examine the incidents that highlight this danger, the underlying causes, and the pressing need for global regulatory and operational reforms
to ensure safer skies.
Historical Cases of Aircraft Shoot-Downs Due to Misidentification
Korean Airlines Flight 007
On September 1, 1983, Korean Airlines Flight 007 deviated from its flight path
due to a navigational error and was tragically
shot down by a Russian Sukhoi fighter plane.
All 269 on board lost their lives
, sparking outrage and
propelling Hans Ephraimson-Abt, who lost his daughter in the crash, to advocate for aviation safety
Unfortunately,
international efforts to prevent such tragedies have often been obstructed by geopolitical interests, as demonstrated by Russia's opposition
to conflict risk regulations proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
DHL Cargo plane
On November 22, 2003, a DHL Cargo plane took off from Baghdad
for Bahrain.
As the flight was making a rapid climb out,
a surface to air missile launched by terrorists struck the left wing between the engine and the wing tip.
crew lost all hydraulics and because the fuel tank was full,
there were no fuel vapours to explode in the exposed fuel tank.
The crew controlled the flight using only differential engine thrust and managed to carry out a safe landing,
displaying exceptional skill.
Iran Air Flight 655
Another catastrophic case occurred on July 3, 1988
when Iran Air Flight 655 was mistakenly identified as a fighter jet by the U.S. Navy warship USS Vincennes
and subsequently shot down over the Strait of Hormuz, killing 290 civilians.
This
misidentification during the Iran-Iraq war stemmed from procedural failures and reliance on inaccurate assumptions,
demonstrating the lethal consequences of flawed decision-making in conflict zones.
Indian Air Force Mi-17 Helicopter
On February 27, 2019, India's own air defence system tragically downed an Indian Air Force Mi-17 helicopter
during a post-Balakot operation, misidentifying it as a hostile target.
Such errors emphasise the risks posed by inadequate identification protocols
and the need for robust training and technology to mitigate human errors.
Contemporary Risks in Conflict Zones
2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine by Russian-backed forces with a surface-to-air missile underscores the dangers
posed by armed conflicts and rogue elements.
Similarly,
the crash of an Azerbaijani airliner in December 2024 near Aktau, Kazakhstan, attributed to Russian anti-aircraft systems
, reveals a troubling pattern of negligence or miscalculation.
Fog and GPS interference may have contributed to the tragedy,
highlighting the vulnerabilities of modern navigation systems.
Post-9/11 measures have introduced specific protocols for handling deviations
and radio communication failures to prevent civilian aircraft from being perceived as threats.
However,
as illustrated by the 2017 interception of Jet Airways Flight 9W 118 by German fighter jets, these procedures are not foolproof.
Indian safety regulator's dismissal of the incident as a mere communication failure underscores the lack of accountability
and transparency in addressing such close calls.
A Closer Look of Challenges in Indian Aviation
Navigational Vulnerabilities
India's geographical location places it in proximity to conflict-prone regions
, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Myanmar.
Reports of GPS interference, jamming, and signal spoofing in these areas raise concerns
about the reliability of navigational systems.
For instance,
modern aircraft rely heavily on GPS for precise navigation
, yet disruptions in these systems can lead to deviations from assigned flight paths, making aircraft susceptible to misidentification by military defence systems.
Airlines must have contingency plans and alternative navigation methods
, such as inertial navigation systems, to counter these risks.
the extent to which Indian carriers have implemented such measures remains unclear,
highlighting a potential gap in preparedness.
Pilot Training and Skill Proficiency
rapid expansion of India’s aviation industry has created a high demand for skilled pilots.
To meet this demand,
some airlines have resorted to accelerated training programs,
which may compromise the depth and quality of pilot education.
Swiss Cheese Model of accident causation highlights how insufficient training can act as a critical "hole" in the safety net,
allowing minor errors to escalate into major incidents.
For example,
pilots must be equipped to handle scenarios involving GPS interference or communication failures.
Yet,
there are concerns about whether Indian airlines provide adequate training to address these modern challenges.
Aging Aircraft and Operational Risks
Another challenge is the reliance on older, leased aircraft in some fleets.
Reports suggest that certain aircraft operated by Indian carriers, including Air India, are not adequately equipped for extended flights
over challenging terrains, such as mountainous regions.
This is
particularly concerning given that many Indian airlines operate long-haul routes,
including non-stop flights to destinations on the west coast of the United States.
These routes demand aircraft with robust technical capabilities
and redundancy systems to handle emergencies.
Regulatory Gaps and Accountability
India's aviation safety regulator, the
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has faced criticism for its lack of transparency
and proactive oversight.
Jet Airways Flight 9W 118 incidents in 2017, where the aircraft lost radio contact over multiple airspaces, exemplifies this issue.
DGCA attributed the incident to a communication system malfunction
but failed to explain why established protocols, such as transponder codes for communication failure, were not followed.
raises questions about the DGCA’s ability to enforce accountability
and implement corrective measures.
Regulatory gaps
not only undermine public trust but also weaken India’s standing in global aviation safety rankings.
The Way Forward to Ensure Safety and Security of Civilian Aircrafts: The Need for Global Action
The grim tally of over 500 lives lost
to aircraft shoot-downs underscores
the urgent need for global cooperation in mitigating risks associated with conflict zones.
International regulatory bodies like
ICAO must enforce stringent guidelines to prevent misidentification and ensure compliance across member states.
Moreover,
technological advancements such as fail-safe communication systems and AI-driven threat assessment tools should be prioritised
to reduce human error in high-stakes situations.
For India,
the focus must shift to enhancing pilot proficiency through rigorous training and implementing robust standard operating procedures
for navigation in adverse conditions.
The DGCA must take proactive measures to ensure that safety is not compromised in the race for aviation growth.
Conclusion
The skies, once seen as a symbol of freedom and connection, have become increasingly fraught with danger
in an era of geopolitical tension and technological vulnerabilities.
historical and contemporary incidents of civilian aircraft shoot-downs are stark reminders of the devastating consequences
of misidentification and procedural failures.
As the aviation industry continues to expand, particularly in regions like India,
the need for rigorous safety protocols and international cooperation becomes ever more pressing.
