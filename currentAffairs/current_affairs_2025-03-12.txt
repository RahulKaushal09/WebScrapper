**********POLG Disease
A 22-year-old young prince of Luxembourg, Prince Frederik, recently died from a rare genetic disease called POLG.
About POLG Disease:
It is a
genetic mitochondrial disorder
that
prevents
the
body’s cells from producing adequate energy
, which in turn can
cause multiple organ dysfunctions
and failures.
The disease affects multiple organs of the body, primarily the brain, nerves, muscles, and liver.
It could
also affect a person’s vision
due to the involvement of affected brain structures.
People with POLG “likely
end up bedridden
unable to function
in so many of those
activities of daily living.
Causes
The condition
affects mitochondria
, the “
powerhouse" of the cell,
which converts food into ATP (Adenosine triphosphate), the
primary source of energy
in living cells of a body.
Mitochondria contain their own DNA,
requires a specific enzyme to replicate, found in
the host cell’s
POLG and POLG2 genes.
Mutations in these genes
therefore
impact the ability for mitochondria to replicate.
Symptoms:
A person can see symptoms, from mild to severe, starting from early childhood to adulthood.
The most frequent symptoms include
muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia
(weakness or
paralysis of the eye
epilepsy,
and liver failure.
POLG also
affects neurological function
and impacts a person’s ability to balance, talk, and walk, and it
causes seizures
and more.
Treatment:
There is
currently no cure
for POLG.
Available treatment for the POLG focuses on managing the symptoms and quality of life.

**********Plastic Ice
Scientists have confirmed the existence of a fourth form of water, Plastic Ice VII, an exotic phase of ice that forms under extreme conditions.
About Plastic Ice:
Under normal conditions, water exists in three phases: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (vapour or steam). Unlike ordinary ice, Plastic Ice VII allows water molecules to
rotate freely within a rigid crystalline structure
This phase was first
predicted in 200
8, but scientists have now provided solid evidence of its existence using advanced neutron-scattering experiments at the Institut Laue-Langevin in France.
The unique structure of Plastic Ice VII forms at pressures exceeding three gigapascals (GPa), about
30,000 times atmospheric pressure on Earth
, and temperatures above 450 Kelvin (177Â°C).
How Was It Discovered?
Researchers used
quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS)
and diamond-anvil cells to study tiny high-pressure samples. These techniques allowed them to analyze molecular motion at the atomic scale.
Their findings confirm that while Plastic Ice VII retains a crystalline structure, its molecules rotate in specific, preferred directions.
Significance of Plastic Ice Discovery:
This discovery has profound implications for
planetary science.
Ice VII, an earlier known phase, exists deep inside the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, such as Callisto, Ganymede, and Titan.
Now, the confirmation of Plastic Ice VII suggests that
water in extreme environments
behaves in even more complex ways than previously thought.
Understanding this exotic ice could help scientists explore whether extreme planetary conditions could support life and how water influences the structure of celestial bodies.
Scientists believe this discovery could lead to new insights in
materials science
, planetary exploration, and even the development of futuristic technologies that use extreme pressure conditions.

**********Kuki Tribe
An armoured vehicle of the central security forces came under heavy attacks by protesters from the Kuki tribes in Manipur on the first day of the Centre's order to ensure free movement of people in the crisis-hit state
About Kuki Tribe:
The Kukis are an ethnic group including multiple tribes originally inhabiting the Northeastern States of India, including Manipur, Mizoram and Assam; parts of Myanmar, and Sylhet district and Chittagong hill tracts of Bangladesh.
Chin people of Myanmar and the Mizo people of Mizoram
are kindred tribes of the Kukis and are collectively known as the Zo people.
Notably, Kuki is not a term coined by the ethnic group itself, the tribes associated with it came to be generically called Kuki under the colonial rule, and were further divided by the British into ‘old Kukis’ and ‘new Kukis’.
The Kukis have a rich cultural heritage, with institutions like Sawm and Lawm playing significant roles in their society.
Sawm is a community center for boys where they learn under the guidance of elders, while Lawm is a youth club that fosters social activities and practical skills
The Kukis traditionally engaged in
shifting or Jhum cultivation
in the forested hills, which allowed them to expand their settlements through the wooded areas over generations.
Their expansionist land ownership patterns due to Jhum cultivation put them at odds with the Nagas, who practised territorial agriculture, and the Meiteis, who lived in the cultivated valley areas.
Kuki Rebellion of 1917-19:
The first resistance to British hegemony by the Kuki people was the Kuki Rebellion of 1917-19, after which their territory was subjugated by the British and divided between the administrations of British India and British Burma.
Up until their defeat in 1919, the Kukis had been an independent people ruled by their chieftains.

**********Pakistani Baloch Separatist Militants Behind Train Hijacking
Why in news?
Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) insurgents attacked and hijacked the Jaffar Express traveling from Quetta to Peshawar on March 11 in Balochistan’s Bolan district.
The BLA claimed responsibility, stating that 182 people were taken hostage, 20 Pakistani military officers were killed, and a drone was shot down.
This marks one of the largest recent attacks by Baloch insurgents amid ongoing unrest in the region.
What’s in today’s article?
Background of the Baloch Insurgency
Strategic and Economic Importance of Balochistan
The BLA emerged in the early 2000s with the goal of achieving Baloch independence.
Pakistan banned the organization in 2006, and the US designated it as a global terrorist group in 2019.
BLA’s Activities and Structure
The US State Department describes the BLA as an armed group targeting security forces and civilians in Baloch areas of Pakistan.
The Majeed Brigade, its suicide squad active since 2011, led the Jaffar Express hijacking. It has been involved in previous attacks, including the March 2024 Gwadar port strike.
Other BLA units involved in the hijacking include the Special Tactical Operations Squad (STOS), Fatah Squad, and Zirab Units.
Historical Context
The roots of the Baloch insurgency predate the BLA and are part of a broader, long-standing separatist movement in Balochistan.
Goals of the BLA
The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.
It is the largest among several ethnic insurgent groups fighting Pakistan’s federal government for decades.
The insurgents claim Balochistan’s rich gas and mineral resources are unfairly exploited and should belong to the local people.
Increasing Lethality of the BLA
In 2022, the BLA shocked Pakistan’s security forces by attacking army and navy bases.
It has deployed women suicide bombers, including in attacks on Chinese nationals in Karachi and southwest Balochistan.
Recently, an umbrella group of Baloch ethnic factions announced efforts to unite under a single military structure, potentially escalating the insurgency further.
Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest but least populated province,
rich in natural resources but economically underdeveloped
Pakistan has four provinces – Balochistan, Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Ethnic Baloch communities have long accused the central government of economic neglect and Punjab’s dominance over resources, military, and bureaucracy.
After independence, Balochistan remained independent under a treaty with Pakistan until March 1948.
Khan of Kalat
, who controlled Kalat, Makran, Las Bela, and Kharan, initially sought independence but later signed the instrument of accession under political pressure.
British concerns over Russian influence and internal demands from other Baloch regions contributed to its integration into Pakistan.
Continued Unrest and Foreign Involvement
Pakistan has accused India of supporting Baloch insurgent groups, an allegation India denies.
China’s
China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
has become a target of Baloch militants, who see it as exploitative and lacking local benefits.
October 2024
, the BLA claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed two Chinese nationals, highlighting their resistance to foreign involvement and Pakistan’s reliance on China.
Key to China's CPEC
: Balochistan is crucial to China’s $65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative.
Rich in Resources
: It hosts major mining projects, including
Reko Diq
, one of the world’s largest
gold and copper mines
, operated by Barrick Gold and China.
Security Concerns
: The long-running Baloch insurgency has destabilized the province, threatening Pakistan’s plans to tap into its vast resources.
Geopolitical Significance
: Balochistan,
Pakistan’s largest province by area but smallest by population, has a long Arabian Sea coastline near the Strait of Hormuz
, a vital oil shipping route.

Pollution in India: Key Highlights
Delhi: The World’s Most Polluted Capital for Six Consecutive Years
Delhi has once again been ranked as the world’s most polluted capital, surpassing other cities in the National Capital Region (NCR) in 2023.
While some NCR cities previously recorded worse pollution levels, Delhi emerged as the most polluted regional city in South Asia.
In 2024, Delhi was the second most polluted city in the world and in Central and South Asia.
Decline in Average PM2.5 Levels
India's average PM2.5 concentration in 2024 was
50.6 µg/m³
, reflecting a
7% decrease
from 2023 (54.4 µg/m³).
Most Polluted Cities
recorded the highest pollution levels globally, with an
annual PM2.5 concentration of 128.2 µg/m³
Six Indian cities

Severe Pollution Episodes in Northern India
January 2024 witnessed poor air quality in Delhi and Himachal Pradesh.
November 2024 saw extreme pollution in Delhi, Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.
Major Pollution Sources
Crop stubble burning accounted for 60% of PM2.5 pollution during peak periods.
Vehicular emissions, industrial discharges, and construction dust were other significant contributors.
Air Pollution: A Global Crisis
Widespread Exposure to Dirty Air

, located in
India, Kazakhstan, Chad, Pakistan, and China
, exceeded
WHO limits by over 10 times
National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)
, introduced in 2019, aimed to reduce pollution.
However, the latest report highlighted persistent challenges due to inconsistent policy implementation and inadequate infrastructure.
Need for Stronger Action
Environmental analysts argue that while Delhi has introduced policies like BS-VI fuel and advanced transportation technology,
poor implementation has led to persistently high pollution levels
They emphasized that systematic actions remain largely on paper and stressed the need for stronger governance and a drastic overhaul of air pollution regulation.
Strengthening NCAP and ensuring sustained action will be crucial for long-term improvement.

**********Rising Consumer Credit in India: A Growing Concern
Why in the News?
Financial Stability Report (FSR) 2024 released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has called attention to the question of household finances and consumption loans.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Key Highlights of FSR (Increasing Household Debt, Shift in Borrowing Trends, Consumption Loan, RBI’s Response, etc.)
Increasing Household Debt: A Cause for Concern
The
RBI's
(FSR) 2024
has highlighted an alarming rise in household debt, which has increased from
36
6% of GDP in June 2021 to 42.9% in June 2024
While India’s household debt remains lower than most emerging economies, the rising debt-to-GDP ratio signals potential macroeconomic weaknesses.
Debt is typically taken to acquire assets such as homes and vehicles. However, recent data indicates that Indian households are borrowing more for consumption rather than for asset creation.
This shift raises concerns about the financial health of lower-income groups and the long-term impact on economic stability.
The Shift in Borrowing Trends:
The RBI report presents a mixed picture regarding consumer credit.
A significant proportion of new loans is being taken by
healthy, prime borrowers
, reducing the share of sub-prime borrowing.
Rising per capita debt is mainly observed among
super-prime borrowers
, who are using loans for asset creation rather than discretionary spending.
Super-prime borrowers, who exhibit the best creditworthiness, are followed by prime borrowers who, while still considered good credit risks, are one step below the top tier.
Borrowing for consumption purposes, however, has increased, particularly among lower-income groups.
While these trends indicate a maturing credit market, the growing reliance on loans for consumption raises concerns about the sustainability of household finances.
Consumption Loans: A Red Flag for Financial Stability
A worrying trend in the report is the increasing share of loans taken for consumption rather than investment in assets like housing or education. The data reveals that:
64% of loans taken by super-prime borrowers
are directed towards asset creation.
Nearly half of the loans taken by sub-prime borrowers
are being used for consumption.
Lower-income households (earning below ₹5 lakh annually) rely heavily on unsecured credit such as
credit card debt and personal loans
for daily expenses.
This trend suggests that many households may be borrowing to meet essential expenses rather than for wealth accumulation.
In addition, rising delinquency rates in
personal loans and credit card debt
indicate increasing financial stress among lower-income groups.
The Multiplier Effect of Rising Debt:
The impact of household debt on economic growth depends on how it affects consumption patterns.
Households with lower incomes generally have a higher
income multiplier
, meaning they spend a larger portion of their income on goods and services.
However, if they are burdened with debt repayments, their disposable income shrinks, reducing overall consumption and slowing down economic growth.
Several key questions arise:
Are households borrowing more due to
income insecurity
post-pandemic?
Are financial innovations, such as
BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) schemes
, encouraging excessive borrowing?
Will this rising debt reduce the effectiveness of future
macroeconomic policy measures
, such as tax cuts or interest rate adjustments?
RBI’s Response: Curbing Unchecked Credit Growth
In response to the rise in unsecured loans, the RBI has introduced measures to
slow down consumer credit growth
since September 2023. These steps include:
Tighter lending norms
for personal loans and credit card borrowing.
Encouraging banks to focus on prime borrowers
, reducing the risk of default.
Monitoring financial institutions
to prevent reckless lending practices.
While these measures have led to a slowdown in credit growth, the structural risks associated with rising consumption debt still remain.
Conclusion:
The increasing reliance on loans for everyday consumption rather than asset creation is a growing concern for India's financial stability.
While the rise in borrowing among prime borrowers is a positive sign, the financial stress among lower-income groups could pose challenges for economic growth.
Policymakers must carefully balance credit growth with financial prudence to ensure that India’s expanding consumer credit market remains sustainable.

**********India-Mauritius Relations - A Strategic and Historical Perspective
Context:
India and Mauritius share
a deep-rooted relationship
, influenced by historical, cultural, and strategic ties. Mauritius is one of the closest nations to India.
There are numerous connections between Delhi and Port Louis (capital of Mauritius), including the fact that
around 70% of the island's 1.3 million residents are of Indian descent.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit
to Mauritius in 2025, a decade after his 2015 visit,
underscores India’s commitment
to enhancing this bilateral partnership.
Historical and Geopolitical Significance of Mauritius:
Mauritius has
a colonial history
involving Portuguese, Dutch, French, and British powers.
Gained independence from Britain in
1968
; however, colonial disputes persisted over the
Chagos
archipelago
The recent UK-Mauritius agreement on Chagos
has significant legal, geopolitical, and humanitarian implications.
India’s Strategic Engagement in the Western Indian Ocean:
Modi’s 2015 visit
marked India’s recognition of the renewed geopolitical importance of the region.
India’s SAGAR
(Security and Growth for All in the Region) doctrine highlights the strategic relevance of the Indian Ocean.
Growing influence of multiple global players
like China, Russia, Europe, and Gulf countries in the region
necessitates proactive Indian engagement
Chagos Archipelago Dispute and Its Resolution:
Britain separated Chagos
(into the “British Indian Ocean Territory”)
from Mauritius
before independence, leasing Diego Garcia to the US for a military base.
Mauritius led a global campaign
to reclaim sovereignty, backed by a 2019 International Court of Justice (
ICJ
) advisory opinion.
affirms Mauritius’s sovereignty, allows a 99-year lease extension for the US base, and ensures India’s regional security concerns against China’s expansion.
The Role of Mauritius in Global Geopolitics:
Historically called the "
Star and Key of the Indian Ocean
," Mauritius has been a critical hub for
maritime trade and global interactions
Its importance fluctuated
with the Suez Canal’s opening and Cold War geopolitics but has resurged due to China’s strategic interests.
China has engaged Mauritius
through infrastructure projects, economic investments, and diplomatic outreach.
India’s Maritime and Security Cooperation with Mauritius:
India is constructing logistics infrastructure on

**********More Signs of Overhauling the Compliance Framework
Context
Despite persistent efforts
to combat corruption, red-tapism and
bribery remain significant barriers to business growth in India.
The
India Business Corruption Survey 2024
highlights a troubling reality:
66% of businesses admit to paying bribes, and 54% state that they were coerced into doing so
to expedite government procedures, acquire permits, or ensure compliance.
This problem is
particularly severe in sectors governed by excessive bureaucracy,
such as labour, taxation, pollution control, property registration, health, and pharmaceuticals.
Therefore
, it is important to examine the economic impact of corruption, the challenges posed by excessive compliance regulations
, the need for digital transformation, and India’s global competitiveness.
The Economic Impact of Corruption
Increased Cost of Doing Business
One of the most direct effects of corruption is the
increased cost of doing business
These
costs often do not end with one-time payments.
Businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises (SMEs), are forced to
continuously engage
in corrupt practices to keep operations running smoothly.
Hindrance to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
The impact of corruption on FDI is perhaps one of the most critical aspects of its economic toll.
EY-FICCI survey
indicates that
80% of respondents
believe corruption is a major deterrent to FDI.
Global investors seek environments that offer
predictability, transparency, and fairness
in business dealings, and corruption undermines these elements.
When potential investors perceive that they will have to pay bribes or engage in illegal practices to navigate the regulatory environment,
they are less likely to invest in India.
Erosion of Entrepreneurial Spirit
Corruption also
dampens the entrepreneurial spirit
The high cost of compliance and the need to navigate a maze of bureaucratic red tape
often discourage new entrepreneurs from starting businesses
For many small businesses and startups, the
fear of bribe demands
or the
potential for regulatory abuse
deters them from entering the market or pursuing their growth ambitions.
Negative Impact on Job Creation
One of the core drivers of economic growth is the
creation of jobs
, and here again, corruption takes a toll.
When businesses are forced to spend substantial resources on bribes and navigating the bureaucracy, they have
fewer resources to invest
in expanding operations or hiring new workers.
The money that could be spent on
training, development, or workforce expansion
is instead siphoned off to meet compliance demands or to pay for regulatory favours.
Creation of Systemic Inefficiency
The constant demands for bribes and the regular alteration of compliance rules create a
climate of inefficiency
Businesses are often forced to
spend valuable time and resources
dealing with a
complicated regulatory framework
rather than focusing on innovation or customer service.
This results in
delays, missed opportunities
, and an overall lack of productivity across various sectors of the economy.
Impact on India's Global Reputation
Corruption also has a
lasting effect on India's global reputation
As a major emerging market, India’s credibility on the world stage is
increasingly scrutinized.
Countries that want to attract investment and skilled talent focus on creating transparent, efficient regulatory systems.
If India’s
bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption
persist, it risks falling behind other emerging economies that are taking proactive steps to streamline their regulatory environments and combat corruption.
The Constant Flux of Compliance Regulations and the Reason Behind It
A major hurdle for businesses is the
ever-changing compliance framework.
Regulatory officials frequently use compliance provisions as tools for bribery
, demanding unofficial payments for approvals, even when businesses have met all requirements.
scale of compliance updates further exacerbates the issue.
In the past year alone, India recorded 9,420 compliance updates, averaging 36 changes per day.
erratic approach either signals regulatory incompetence or a deliberate effort to create corruption pipelines.
Some regulatory bodies have begun to address this.
Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
, for instance,
has introduced a rule that food label regulations will only be updated once a year
, creating a predictable regulatory environment.
Similar measures should be adopted across all sectors
to reduce uncertainty and minimise opportunities for corruption.
Lack of Labour Law Reforms: A Missed Opportunity
significant portion of compliance-related imprisonment clauses stems from outdated labour laws,
which fall under the Concurrent List of India’s Constitution.
Although
India replaced 29 colonial-era labour laws
with four modern labour codes, they have yet to be implemented.
These long-promised reforms,
touted as India’s biggest labour reforms in history,
remain stuck in bureaucratic limbo.
Until state governments operationalise these reforms,
businesses will continue to suffer from outdated and excessively punitive regulations.
The Need for a Digital-First Compliance System
India’s current business registration process is
highly inefficient
Establishing a factory requires entrepreneurs to submit
hundreds of notarised documents
40 different government departments
This archaic system
breeds inefficiency and corruption
digital-first approach
can revolutionize business compliance. A
single business identifier
, linked to a
secure digital repository (Digi Locker)
, could allow regulators to
access verified documents instantly
This system, similar to India’s
Digi Yatra
, would drastically
reduce approval times from months to days
Currently, Indian businesses must navigate
at least 23 different identity numbers
, including
PAN, GSTIN, CIN, professional tax numbers, and factory licenses
, each with its own renewal process.
‘One Nation, One Business’ identity system
could consolidate these into a
single identifier
, simplifying regulatory compliance and reducing opportunities for bribery.
small budget allocation
for this initiative could dramatically
enhance India’s appeal to investors
Consequence of Corruption and Complex Regulations: India’s Global Competitiveness at Risk
global competition for investment
is intensifying.
United States
is actively enhancing its business environment through governance reforms, including its
Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)
, designed to simplify regulatory procedures.
If the
world’s largest economy ($27 trillion GDP)
is becoming
even more business-friendly
, investors have little incentive to choose
India’s $4 trillion economy
, where
bureaucratic inefficiencies persist
Without urgent reforms,
India risks losing both investment and entrepreneurial talent
, key drivers of its
knowledge economy
The country stands at a
critical juncture
—either it
modernizes its compliance framework
loses ground in the global economic race
Conclusion
India must move beyond
piecemeal reforms
and embrace
a holistic approach
simplify compliance, eradicate corruption, and create a predictable regulatory framework
Jan Vishwas 2.0 is a start
Significant structural changes are required to
eliminate outdated imprisonment clauses
reduce regulatory subjectivity
digitize compliance processes
To attract
global companies and encourage domestic entrepreneurship
, India must
act decisively
time for complacency is over
—India must embrace a
business-friendly future
that prioritises
efficiency, transparency, and growth

**********Building Compassion into the Health-Care Structure
Context
On February 7, 2025, the World Health Organisation (WHO) released a landmark report titled
‘Compassion and Primary Health Care,
’ recognising compassion as a transformative force in the medical field.
WHO’s Director-General,
emphasised the need to explore the role of compassion in global health,
particularly its impact on the quality of health-care services and primary care.
This
report reinforces the growing call to integrate compassion into medical practice
, an idea that has been championed in various international forums.
The Benefits of Compassionate Health Care
The role of compassion in health care
extends beyond moral obligations
, it has tangible benefits for both patients and medical professionals.
Patients treated with compassion experience quicker recoveries
and shorter hospital stays, as demonstrated by research from Stanford University’s Centre for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE).
Similarly,
a study conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital found that even small gestures
, such as doctors spending an additional 40 seconds reassuring patients,
significantly reduce anxiety and positively influence recovery outcomes.
For health-care providers
, practicing compassion leads to reduced stress, improved job satisfaction, and stronger patient relationships.
By maintaining a balance
between emotional involvement and professional detachment,
medical professionals can prevent burnout
while providing high-quality care.
Understanding Compassion: A Distinction from Empathy and Sympathy
Compassion is often confused with sympathy, empathy, and kindness
, but these terms have distinct meanings.
Sympathy is a temporary feeling of pity,
while empathy involves deeply feeling another person’s pain, sometimes leading to emotional exhaustion.
Health-care providers who operate purely with empathy risk experiencing anxiety
and burnout, ultimately affecting the quality of care they deliver.
Compassion, however, is a more sustainable approach.
It enables medical professionals to acknowledge and address a patient’s suffering without being overwhelmed.
A compassionate health-care provider understands a patient’s pain
but remains emotionally stable, allowing them to make rational decisions that benefit both the patient and themselves.
Compassion in Mental Health Care
The Growing Mental Health Crisis
Mental health disorders
, particularly depression and anxiety,
have reached alarming levels worldwide.
Factors such as
social isolation, economic uncertainty, and trauma contribute to the increasing burden
of mental illnesses.
Unlike physical ailments,
mental health conditions are often invisible
and carry a stigma that prevents individuals from seeking help.
This makes compassionate care even more critical
in ensuring that patients receive the support they need without fear of judgment or neglect.
Compassion in mental health care means providing patients with a safe space
where they feel understood and valued.
involves acknowledging their struggles, actively listening
, and offering emotional and psychological support without making them feel weak or burdensome.
Research has shown that individuals receiving compassionate mental health care are
more likely to adhere to treatment plans
, develop coping mechanisms, and ultimately recover.
The Role of Compassion in Mental Health Recovery
Compassionate mental health care is particularly important
for individuals who have experienced trauma, abuse, or neglect.
Survivors of extreme situations
, such as war, violence, and human trafficking,
often develop deep psychological scars.
Their healing process
depends not only on medical interventions but also on emotional support, patience, and human connection.
A Case Study of Compassion in Mental Health Care
The case of Pradeep, a rescued child who suffered severe trauma
, is a striking example of how compassion facilitates mental healing.
Labelled as cursed and nearly sacrificed due to superstitious beliefs
, Pradeep endured extreme neglect and abandonment.
When he arrived at Bal Ashram, a long-term rehabilitation centre, he was unable to communicate
and displayed severe emotional distress.
Rather than forcing him to talk about his past,
caregivers at Bal Ashram took a compassionate approach,
allowing him to heal at his own pace.
Trained in "
compassion in action," the staff provided him with a nurturing environment
where he felt safe and supported.
Over time, he developed friendships, opened up about his experiences,
and regained his ability to communicate.
This transformation illustrates how compassion plays a crucial role
in rehabilitating individuals suffering from psychological trauma.
Strategies for Implementing Compassionate Health Care
Raising Awareness:
Compassion must be recognised as a fundamental principle in health-care decision-making. Industry leaders, hospitals, and policy-makers should prioritize compassionate care in their strategic planning.
Training Health-Care Providers
Medical professionals
must be educated on what compassionate care entails
and how it can be applied effectively.
Experiential learning and quality training programs can equip doctors
, nurses, and paramedical staff with the skills needed to provide compassionate care.
Ensuring Equitable and Accessible Health Care
Compassionate health care must be
inclusive, ensuring quality treatment
for all individuals, regardless of socio-economic status, gender, or background.
A truly compassionate health-care system is
people-centric and responsive
to the needs of all communities.
Conclusion
Health care is not solely about treating illnesses,
it is about promoting overall well-being.
Compassion should be at the core of medical practice
, guiding decision-making and patient interactions.
By developing awareness
, providing adequate training, and ensuring equitable access to care,
the global medical community can establish a health-care system rooted in compassion.
It is time to embrace and globalise compassionate health care,
ensuring that every patient receives the care and dignity they deserve.

How does compassion differ from sympathy, empathy, and kindness in the context of health care?
: Compassion is the
ability to recognize a patient’s suffering
and actively take steps to alleviate it. It involves an emotional connection combined with a willingness to help.
: A nurse notices that a terminally ill patient is in pain despite receiving standard treatment. She advocates for a change in medication to improve the patient’s comfort while offering emotional support to the family.
: Sympathy is
feeling sorrow or concern for someone’s suffering
but without deeply sharing their emotional experience.
: A doctor expresses condolences to a patient’s family after delivering bad news but does not necessarily feel the pain personally.
: Empathy is the ability to
understand and share the feelings of another person
by mentally putting oneself in their position.
: A physician listens to a patient with chronic pain, acknowledges the emotional toll, and adjusts treatment plans accordingly while providing reassurance.

Why in the News?
Despite ongoing efforts to fight corruption, bureaucratic delays and bribery continue to be major obstacles to business growth in India.
What are the key sectors in India most affected by corruption and red-tapism, according to the “India Business Corruption Survey 2024”?
Persistent Corruption and Bureaucratic Hurdles:
Despite ongoing reforms, the
reveals that 66% of businesses admit to paying bribes, with 54% coerced into doing so to expedite processes or secure necessary permits.
Sectors like GST, income tax, and property registration remain particularly vulnerable to corrupt practices, posing significant challenges to business growth.
Deterrent to Foreign Investment:
According to the
EY-FICCI survey
, 80% of respondents view corruption as a major obstacle to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India. This highlights the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to establish a transparent and predictable regulatory environment conducive to both domestic and international business.
Incomplete Compliance Reforms:
While the
Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Act, 2023
and the proposed
Jan Vishwas 2.0
aim to decriminalise a combined total of around 280 provisions, over 20,000 provisions with imprisonment clauses remain unaddressed.
What are the four new labour codes?
Code on Wages (2019):
Standardizes wage-related laws, including minimum wages, timely payments, and equal pay for equal work.
Industrial Relations Code (2020):
Simplifies rules on trade unions, industrial disputes, and employment terms, allowing fixed-term employment.
Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions Code (2020):
Ensures safe working environments, better health standards, and welfare for all workers across industries.
Code on Social Security (2020):
Expands social security benefits like provident funds, insurance, and maternity benefits, including gig and platform workers.
Why is the implementation of the four new labour codes crucial for India’s business environment?
Simplification of Labour Laws:
The four labour codes consolidate 29 existing laws, reducing complexity and making it easier for businesses to understand and comply with legal requirements.
For instance
, companies no longer need to navigate multiple regulations for wages, as the
standardizes definitions and payment rules across sectors.
Enhancing Ease of Doing Business:
By reducing regulatory overlaps and streamlining compliance, the labour codes cut down bureaucratic delays and corruption risks.
For example
, under the
Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code
, a single license can cover multiple locations, simplifying operations for large businesses.
Greater Workforce Flexibility:
The new codes allow for fixed-term employment, enabling businesses to manage workforce needs based on demand without lengthy contractual obligations.
, manufacturing firms can now hire temporary workers for seasonal production spikes without facing penalties under outdated laws.
Ensuring Social Security for Workers:
Social Security Code
extends benefits like provident funds and health insurance to gig and platform workers, expanding the safety net.
, delivery personnel working for online platforms now qualify for social welfare schemes, improving job security and worker welfare.
How can a digital-first approach, such as the ‘One Nation, One Business’ identity system, reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption in India?
Simplified Business Registrations and Compliance:
Currently, businesses need multiple identifiers like PAN, GSTIN, CIN, and state-specific licenses, leading to duplication and delays.
system would unify these into
a single digital identity
, reducing the need for repetitive filings and lowering the chances of officials demanding
for faster processing.
Reduced Human Discretion and Corruption:
Digital systems provide
automated checks
real-time tracking
of applications, minimizing manual intervention.
Businesses applying for
pollution control certificates
labour permits
could do so online, reducing face-to-face interactions where
unofficial payments
are often demanded to expedite approvals.
Faster Approvals and Increased Transparency:
A unified digital platform, similar to
DigiLocker
, could store
pre-verified documents
accessible to all regulatory bodies.
This would enable faster processing of approvals like
property registrations
drug licenses
, reducing the delays and
informal payments
typically required to move applications through bureaucratic bottlenecks.
What lessons can India learn from global governance models, such as the United States’ Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)?
Streamlined Regulatory Processes:
focuses on simplifying government procedures by reducing redundant regulations and consolidating compliance requirements.
India could adopt a similar approach by
rationalizing overlapping laws
implementing a single-window clearance system
to minimize delays and reduce the scope for corruption.
Enhanced Digital Integration:
promotes
digital platforms
for real-time monitoring and automated decision-making. India could enhance its
Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)
integrating regulatory databases
Performance Accountability:
enforces
outcome-based assessments
to measure the efficiency of public officials. India could implement
performance metrics
for government departments.
Way forward:
Adopt a Unified Digital Governance Framework:
Implement a
National Business Identity System
to integrate all regulatory processes (e.g., taxation, labour compliance, environmental clearances) under a
single digital platform

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Ethnic clashes; Internal Security;
Why in the News?
After months of struggling to manage the ethnic crisis, the Union government finally took action by removing the N. Biren Singh-led government in Manipur and imposing President’s Rule, hoping this change would bring peace and stability.
Who are the key stakeholders involved in the ethnic conflict, and what are their demands?
Meitei Community:
Seeks protection of territorial integrity and opposes any division of Manipur.
Example:
Meitei groups have opposed the creation of a separate Kuki-Zo administrative region, fearing it would fragment the State.
Kuki-Zo Community:
Calls for
Union Territory status
or a
separate administrative arrangement
to safeguard their identity and security.
Civil society organizations representing the Kuki-Zo people have warned against free movement unless their request for separate governance is met.
Naga Community:
Resists any move to carve out a separate region, as it could affect their ancestral lands and autonomy.
Naga groups have opposed the Kuki-Zo call for Union Territory status, fearing loss of their territorial claims.
Union Government:
Aims to
restore law and order
, maintain
, and recover stolen arms.
After imposing
, the government set a deadline for militant groups to surrender looted weapons and worked to reopen blockaded highways.
What steps has the Union government taken to restore normalcy in Manipur after imposing President’s Rule?
Weapon Recovery Drive:
Initiated efforts to retrieve stolen weapons from non-State actors to curb violence.
Set a deadline for groups to return weapons looted from police armories, recovering nearly one-third of the 3,000 missing firearms.
Clearing Highway Blockades:
Worked to remove blockades on key highways to restore the free movement of goods and people.
Central armed police forces attempted to clear blockades in Kangpokpi district, though clashes resulted in one death and over 40 injuries.
Strengthening Security Measures:
Deployed additional central forces to control violence and secure vulnerable areas.
Increased the presence of paramilitary forces in both the hill and valley regions to prevent further ethnic clashes.
Engaging in Dialogue:
Encouraged talks with community representatives while rejecting violent and separatist threats.
Continued discussions with leaders from the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities to find a peaceful resolution.
Central Leadership Involvement:
Called for the active engagement of senior government officials to address grievances and appeal for peace.
The Union Home Ministry and senior officials emphasized the need for dialogue and public appeals to restore calm and facilitate the return of displaced persons.
Why is the demand for Union Territory status or a separate arrangement for Kuki-Zo areas considered a dangerous move?
Deepening Ethnic Divisions:
Such a move could escalate tensions between communities, worsening the already fragile social fabric.
It may intensify hostility between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo groups, making reconciliation and long-term peace more difficult.
Resistance from Other Communities:
The proposal could face strong opposition from other ethnic groups, such as the Nagas, who also reside in the hill areas and have their own territorial interests.
Naga groups may view the creation of a separate Kuki-Zo region as a threat to their claims and autonomy, leading to new conflicts.
Undermining Territorial Integrity:
Fragmenting the state could weaken Manipur’s territorial integrity and set a precedent for further separatist demands.
Accepting such a demand could encourage other communities to seek similar autonomous arrangements, complicating governance and stability.
Way forward:
Inclusive Dialogue and Mediation:
Facilitate continuous engagement with all ethnic groups to address grievances and promote mutual understanding through impartial mediation.
Strengthening Law and Order:
Intensify efforts to recover illegal weapons, enforce rule of law, and ensure equitable development to rebuild trust and maintain peace.
Mains PYQ:
Analyze internal security threats and transborder crimes along Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan borders including Line of Control (LoC). Also discuss the role played by various security forces in this regard.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
RNA interference (RNAi)
Why in the News?
Scientists at Tropic, a UK-based biotech company,
disabled the PPO gene in bananas
slowing down the browning process while allowing normal ripening.
About the Genetically Engineered Bananas
Genetically engineered bananas are modified using biotechnology to
extend shelf life, resist browning, and enhance durability
These bananas
stay yellow for 12 hours after peeling
and are less prone to bruising.
The modification prevents
enzymatic browning
, making bananas look fresh for longer without altering their ripening process.
The modification targets
polyphenol oxidase (PPO), the enzyme responsible for browning
By
disabling PPO activity
, oxidation of pigments is slowed, delaying the formation of brown spots.
Gene-Silencing Method Used:
is used to
silence the PPO gene
, reducing its activity without affecting overall banana development.
RNAi introduces
small RNA molecules
that
block PPO gene expression
, preventing the synthesis of the browning enzyme.
This method is
precise and does not introduce foreign DNA
, making it different from traditional genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
Gene-editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9
are also being explored for future crop modifications.

, up from
₹68,547 crore in March 2021
.
About the
The KCC Scheme is a
government-backed credit initiative
designed to provide
timely and adequate credit
to farmers for agricultural and allied activities.
Launched in 1998
on the recommendation of
NABARD (R.V. Gupta Committee)
, the scheme aims to ensure easy access to institutional credit, reducing farmers’ dependency on
moneylenders and informal credit sources
Purpose of KCC:
Provides
short-term credit
crop cultivation and post-harvest needs
Supports
working capital requirements
farm mechanization, dairy, poultry, fisheries, and other allied agricultural activities
Helps meet
household consumption needs
of farmers.
Allows credit access for
investment in agriculture-related businesses
Credit and Repayment System:
Farmers can avail
collateral-free loans up to ₹2 lakh
Interest rates start as low as 4% per annum
(with government interest subvention for timely repayment).
loan limit was increased from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh in Budget 2025-26
Revolving credit
system allows farmers to
withdraw and repay as needed
within the sanctioned limit.
Repayment schedules are
linked to the crop harvesting cycle
, ensuring
no undue financial burden
Implementation:
Commercial Banks; Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)
Small Finance Banks
Cooperative Banks.
Additional Benefits:
Comes with
insurance coverage
under the
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)
to protect against crop loss.
Covers
fisheries and animal husbandry farmers
(since 2018-19).
Successes and Limitations of the KCC Scheme:
Failures
Increased Financial Inclusion:
7.3 crore active accounts, reducing reliance on moneylenders.
Higher Agricultural Productivity:
Easy access to inputs like seeds, fertilizers, and machinery.
Increased Support:
Interest subvention makes loans affordable; loan limit raised from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh (Budget 2025-26).
Promoted Rural Development:
Covers women farmers, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), and non-farm activities.
Rising NPAs:
Discussed above.
Loan Misuse:
Funds diverted for non-agricultural expenses, increasing defaults.
Low Financial Literacy:
Many farmers unaware of repayment terms, leading to debt traps.
High Credit Dependency:
Continuous borrowing without income growth raises financial risks.

**********What are Collisionless Shock Waves?
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
A recent study published by Johns Hopkins University (USA) and Northumbria University (UK) reveals
how
Collisionless Shock Waves act as
cosmic accelerators
, helping subatomic particles gain ultra-high energy and travel vast distances in space.
Collisionless shock waves are disturbances in
plasma
(ionized gas) where energy transfer occurs
without direct particle collisions
, relying instead on
electromagnetic forces
They are found in
supernova remnants, black hole disks, pulsars, magnetars, and planetary magnetospheres
They act as
natural cosmic accelerators
, boosting electrons and other charged particles to
ultra-high speeds
Key Findings from the Study
NASA’s
MMS, THEMIS,
ARTEMIS
missions observed
an electron acceleration event
near Earth’s
bow shock
December 17, 2017
Electrons in Earth’s
foreshock region
gained
500 keV of energy
, reaching
86% of the speed of light
, a huge increase from their usual
1 keV
Diffusive shock acceleration
(known for producing high-energy cosmic rays) requires electrons to
already
be moving at
50% of light speed
before further acceleration can occur.
The study identifies
how electrons receive this initial boost
, a long-standing astrophysical mystery.
Scientists have long assumed that
supernova explosions
are the primary source of
The recent study suggests that
planetary magnetospheres interacting with stellar winds
could also contribute to high-energy cosmic rays.
How Shock Waves accelerate Particles without Collisions?
Unlike in
solids, liquids, or gases
, where energy is transferred via
molecular collisions
particles interact through
electromagnetic fields
This allows shock waves to accelerate electrons
without direct contact
Multi-Stage Acceleration Process:
Plasma waves interact with electrons
, imparting initial energy.
Magnetic turbulence in the shock front
causes electrons to spiral, further increasing their speed.
Repeated interactions with plasma waves
push electrons to
relativistic speeds
Role of Earth’s Bow Shock & Foreshock:
When the
solar wind collides with Earth’s magnetosphere
, it forms a
ahead of this wave is highly turbulent, enabling
efficient electron acceleration
