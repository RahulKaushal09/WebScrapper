ABHAYA MUDRA
Syllabus
Prelims & Mains – Art & Culture
Context:
In his first speech as Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi on Monday invoked the abhaya mudra, the gesture of the raised open palm that is commonly understood as conveying reassurance and a freedom from fear.
Background:-
According to Buddhist legend, Devadatta, a cousin and a disciple of the Buddha, upon not being granted the special treatment he expected, plotted to harm the Buddha . He fed a wild elephant intoxicants and drove her on the Buddha’s path. As the disciples scattered before the charging animal, the Buddha raised his hand in the abhaya mudra. The elephant is said to have calmed down immediately, gone down on her knees, and bowed her head to the Buddha.
Key takeaways
In Sanskrit, the term mudra could mean a seal, mark, sign, or currency, but in the Buddhist context, it refers to “hand and arm gestures made during the course of ritual practice or depicted in images of buddhas, bodhisattvas, tantric deities, and other Buddhist images.

Mudras are most commonly associated with visual depictions of the Buddha (or Buddharupa), with different gestures conveying different moods and meanings, signifying the subtle manifestations of the Buddha’s states of realisation.
The earliest depictions of the Buddha in physical form date to roughly around the turn of the first millennium. Depictions started appearing in the Gandhara art from the northwestern edge of the Indian subcontinent.
In the earliest depictions of Buddharupa, four mudras can be found: the abhaya mudra, or “gesture of fearlessness”; the bhumisparsha mudra, or “Earth-touching gesture”; the dharmachakra mudra, or “gesture of the wheel of dharma”; and the dhyana mudra, or “gesture of meditation”.
Gesture of fearlessness
The abhaya mudra is described as one typically formed with the palm of the right hand facing outward at shoulder height and the fingers pointing up. Occasionally, the index, second, or third finger touches the thumb, with the remaining fingers extended upward. In some cases, both hands may simultaneously be raised in this posture in a double abhayamudra.
In Buddhist tradition, the abhaya mudra is associated with the Buddha immediately after he obtained Enlightenment, “portraying a sense of the security, serenity, and compassion that derive from enlightenment”.
The gesture of fearlessness also identifies the moment when Shakyamuni (the Buddha) tamed the mad elephant, illustrating the Buddha’s ability to grant fearlessness to his followers.
This is why the abhaya mudra is also seen as a “gesture of protection” or “gesture of granting refuge”.
Over time, the abhaya mudra appeared in depictions of Hindu deities, and the Buddha himself was absorbed into the Hindu pantheon as the ninth avatar of the Puranic god Vishnu.
As multiple traditions, practices, and cultural influences mingled in the great melting pot of the Hindu religion, manifestations were seen in art and visual depiction of gods. The abhaya mudra was seen in the depictions, most commonly of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Ganesha.

CRITICAL MINERAL RECYCLING: GOVT PLANS PLI SCHEME TO BOOST CIRCULAR ECONOMY
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
The Ministry of Mines is in the initial stages of designing a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost the recycling of critical minerals in India.
This move aims to foster a circular economy and bolster domestic supply chains, following a lacklustre response to recent auctions of critical mineral blocks.
Critical Minerals
Critical minerals are those minerals that areessential for economic development and national security, the lack of availability of these minerals or concentration of extraction or processing in a few geographical locations may lead to supply chain vulnerabilities.
The Government India has identified 30 minerals as Critical Minerals.
The30 critical minerals are Antimony, Beryllium, Bismuth, Cobalt, Copper, Gallium, Germanium, Graphite, Hafnium, Indium, Lithium, Molybdenum, Niobium, Nickel, PGE, Phosphorous, Potash, REE, Rhenium, Silicon, Strontium, Tantalum, Tellurium, Tin, Titanium, Tungsten, Vanadium, Zirconium, Selenium and Cadmium.
They are elements that are the building blocks of essential modern-day technologies.These minerals are now used everywhere from making mobile phones, and computers to batteries, electric vehicles, and green technologies like solar panels and wind turbines.
Based on their individual needs and strategic considerations, different countries create their own lists.
Proposed PLI Scheme and its need
The proposed PLI scheme aligns with policy recommendations from NITI Aayog and complements the Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR), 2022, which mandate phased recycling of used electric vehicle (EV) lithium-ion batteries from 2026 onwards.
The PLI scheme, while yet to be finalised, will target e-waste recycling– often referred to as “urban mining”– to recover critical minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt, graphite, chromium, and silicon.
These minerals are crucial for clean energy technologies like solar PV modules, wind turbines, energy storage systems, and EVs, as well as consumer electronics.
Some recyclers argue the scheme should benefit only those extracting high-purity critical minerals suitable for reuse as primary inputs.
Others advocate for a wider scope that includes the production of black mass, which is shredded and processed e-waste rich in minerals including lithium, manganese, cobalt, and nickel, since most Indian recyclers currently lack capacities to extract battery-grade minerals from black mass.
India’s e-waste generation is poised to surge, driven by rapid growth in solar and wind energy infrastructure and EV adoption.
Industry estimates project solar PV module waste to jump from 100 kilotonnes (kt) in FY23 to 340 kt by 2030. Additionally, 500 kt of EV batteries are expected to reach recycling units in the coming years.
Research indicates that recycling critical minerals can significantly reduce the need for virgin ores and new mines.
The need to incentivise the growth of critical mineral recycling has become all the more urgent after most critical mineral blocks offered by the Mines Ministry failed to pass the technical bids stage, which requires at least three eligible bidders. This indicates a lack of investor interest in domestic mining of critical minerals.
For Your Information:
The new incentives will also build on the Battery Waste Management Rules (BWMR) notified in 2022 by the Central Pollution Control Board.
These rules mandate that producers of batteries containing lithium, nickel, cobalt, and lead ensure environmentally sound management of waste batteries through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) compliance.
EPR compliance, based on the polluter pays principle, holds producers accountable for managing the waste generated by their products. Producers can meet compliance by trading credits with recyclers

UNCHECKED URBAN EXPANSION
Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Unchecked and ill-thought-out urban expansion is the principal reason behind chronic urban flooding in Delhi, and the larger National Capital Region (NCR).
Last week, a spell of heavy rain brought parts of Delhi to a standstill. Streets across the city and in the larger NCR were inundated, leading to hours-long traffic block. Water-logging also led to lengthy power cuts, property damage, and loss of life.
<img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-194793 size-full" decoding="async" height="399" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/amne.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/amne.png 990w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/amne-300x121.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/amne-768x310.png 768w" width="990"/>
Rapidly growing city :
Delhi is undergoing one of the world’s fastest urban expansions. According to data from NASA’s Earth Observatory, the geographic size of Delhi almost doubled from 1991 to 2011.
Most of this expansion has occurred on the peripheries of New Delhi, with erstwhile rural areas becoming engulfed in the capital’s urban sprawl.
Cities outside Delhi, but a part of the NCR — Bahadurgarh, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Noida, and Gurugram — have also witnessed rapid urbanisation.
According to the United Nations’ The World’s Cities in 2018 data booklet, Delhi will overtake Tokyo as the world’s most populous city by 2030, with an estimated population of nearly 39 million, roughly two and a half times its population in 2000.
Topography and drainage
Urban expansion, however, has paid little heed to Delhi’s natural topography. Topography determines drainage patterns.
If one looks at Delhi’s historic cities — from Tughlakabad, Mehrauli, and Shahjahanabad to Civil Lines, New Delhi, and the Cantonment area — all were carefully selected, and built on higher ground.
This allowed rainwater to drain out. But as the city has expanded, not enough thought has gone behind building with regards to the land’s drainage capacities.
Thus, with high-intensity rain there is significant run-off (unconfined flow of water, which occurs when there is more water on the land’s surface than it can absorb), and existing drainage systems have been inadequate.
Concrete everywhere
Due to urbanisation, water cannot simply flow down the existing natural gradient. Today, much of the water gets channelised into concretised nallahs (drains), which have been turned into sewage dumps.
Construction in low-lying areas only makes things worse. For instance, many nallahs from across South Delhi, as far as Chanakyapuri and R K Puram, converge at Sarai Kale Khan, a low-lying area in South East Delhi, next to the Yamuna. This is why the urban village sees intense flooding every year.
Construction in Delhi’s flood plains began as early as the 1900s, when the British decided to build a railway line along the river bed.
Need for water masterplan
Urban planners need to come up with a “water masterplan”. There has been a consistent neglect of water as a planning resource.
No comprehensive planning taking into account the city’s clean and waste water flows has been carried out in the last 70 years. This is why, for example, the new Pragati Maidan Tunnel, inaugurated in 2022, has been flooded each monsoon.
Water bodies which can help manage flooding have also been systematically destroyed. According to official records, Delhi has some 1,000 water bodies. But on the ground there are not more than 400. These 600 ‘missing’ water bodies which could have managed flooding in the city have been filled up, and converted into valuable real estate.
Unless we stop building in low-lying areas, de-concretise our lawns and pavements, and stop blocking the drains with solid waste, the floods won’t stop. Understanding gradients and working with the lay of the land is crucial.

**********UK General Election 2024
Why in news?
The United Kingdom is all set for a crucial general election today (July 4). Rishi Sunak, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, called a snap general election for July 4, 2024, even though the next election was not required until December 2024.
Experts and polling data suggest a landmark election is imminent, with the Labour Party likely to end the Conservatives' 14-year rule.
What’s in today’s article?
Nature of Parliament
Nature of the Governance System
Voting System of the United Kingdom
What Labour’s win could mean for India-UK FTA?
Nature of the Parliament of UK
The UK Parliament is a bicameral legislature, consisting of two houses:
House of Commons
The lower house, made up of 650 MPs elected by the public through FPTP.
533 for England; 59 for Scotland; 40 for Wales; 18 for Northern Ireland
It is the primary legislative body, responsible for making and passing laws.
The party (or coalition) with the majority of seats forms the government, and its leader becomes the Prime Minister.
The opposition is made up of MPs from parties not in government.
House of Lords
The upper house, which is unelected and includes life peers, bishops, and hereditary peers.
It reviews and suggests amendments to legislation proposed by the House of Commons.
While it can delay legislation, it cannot ultimately prevent bills passed by the Commons from becoming law.
The United Kingdom operates under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy. Key features include:
Monarch
The head of state is the monarch, currently King Charles III.
The role is largely ceremonial, with real political power vested in elected bodies.
The head of government is the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the monarch and is responsible for running the government, making policy decisions, and representing the UK domestically and internationally.
Cabinet
Comprises senior government ministers chosen by the Prime Minister.
Ministers are typically heads of government departments and are responsible for implementing government policy.
Background
The House of Commons, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Parliament, Northern Ireland Assembly and UK local authorities use different voting systems.
First-past-the-post
, mayoral elections in England, Police and Crime Commissioner elections and local councils in England and Wales use the first-past-the-post system.
Voters select their preferred candidate. The candidate with the most votes wins.
Formation of the government
If a single party wins a majority of the 650 seats, their leader will become the new Prime Minister.
If no party achieves a majority, a hung parliament will be declared, and the largest party may attempt to form a coalition government.
In this year’s election, the two main contenders for Prime Minister are Rishi Sunak of the Conservative Party and Keir Starmer of the Labour Party.
India and UK have been negotiating a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) for more than two years to boost trade between the two nations.
The agreement could result in a mutual tariff relaxation on a range of goods such as cars, clothes, alcoholic beverages, and medical instruments.
However, a landslide victory for the Labour Party in the UK elections could lead to a change in the dynamic of the FTA negotiations.
Political certainty might be beneficial for the deal
Since the UK's unexpected referendum to leave the European Union, London has lacked the political stability needed to negotiate a trade deal with India, which has a high tariff regime.
However, if Labour wins decisively, there might be enough political stability to sign such a deal.
Growing support for India in the current Labour Party
Under Keir Starmer, Labour party has changed. It is not the same party as that headed by his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, who called for international intervention in Kashmir.
Starmer has recognised the growing political clout of the UK’s Indian origin population — the largest immigrant group in the country.
Visas a likely sticking point
Immigration remains among the most heated issues in British politics. This could be a sticking point for a trade deal with India.
New Delhi is seeking temporary visas for its service sector workforce under the FTA — this is where it expects to gain the most in the deal.
With the UK being a powerhouse in the IT and financial services segment, India’s service sector could benefit from the integration.
But given the UK’s political climate, Labour is likely to negotiate hard on the visa issue.
Tougher negotiations on climate
India will also likely face tougher negotiations on climate from a Labour government.
India has sought a relaxation on the carbon tax that the UK is expected to implement along the lines of the EU.
A carbon tax is a government-imposed price that emitters pay for each ton of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions they release.
New Delhi argued during the FTA negotiations that the proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism could take away much of the tariff concessions agreed during the FTA.

**********Air pollution behind 7% of deaths in 10 cities
Why in news?
A study published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal found that air pollution is a major health concern in India.
In 10 of the largest and most polluted cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai, 7.2 percent of all daily deaths were linked to PM2.5 levels. These levels were higher than the safe exposure
guidelines set by the World Health Organization
(WHO).
What’s in today’s article?
WHO’s revised air quality guidelines 2021
Key highlights of the reports
Steps taken to control air pollution
About
In September 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) has strengthened its air quality guidelines.
The revised norms recommend air quality levels for
six pollutants
:
Ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide.
The other two are PM10 and PM2.5 -- particulate matter equal or smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter.
The recommended levels for all the six pollutants have been revised
downwards from the existing norms that have been in place since 2005
Non-binding in nature
The WHO norms are
not binding
on any country.
These are only recommended norms considered safe for human health, backed by scientific studies. However,
air quality does affect the international image of a country
Key highlights of the study conducted by The Lancet Planetary Health journal
Observations made w.r.t. Delhi
11.5% of annual deaths (around 12,000) are due to air pollution.
This is the highest percentage for any city in India.
Situation across 10 Major Cities
Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Shimla, and Varanasi were included in the study.
More than 33,000 deaths annually are attributed to air pollution.
Shimla has the lowest pollution-related mortality burden, with 59 deaths annually (3.7% of total deaths).
On average, 7.2% of all deaths in these cities are caused by air pollution.
PM2.5 Exposure
PM2.5 levels in these cities exceed WHO's safe limit (15 micrograms per cubic metre) 99.8% of the days.
Data collected from civil registries between 2008 and 2019 for daily deaths.
Over 3.6 million deaths examined.
Researchers used a machine-learning-based exposure model for detailed PM2.5 data.
Mortality and Pollution Levels
Mortality increases by 1.42% for every 10 micrograms per cubic metre rise in PM2.5 levels.
Less polluted cities showed a higher risk of mortality due to pollution increase.
A spike in air pollution in Indian cities that have clean air may raise death rates higher than in cities that have higher pollution loads.
Thus, the same increase in air pollution in, say, Bengaluru, can raise death rates more than in Delhi, which has much higher background levels of air pollution.
Research Insights
Cities with lower pollution levels, like Bengaluru and Shimla, showed stronger effects due to sharp risk increases at lower exposure levels.
The study is a pioneering effort in understanding the relationship between short-term air pollution exposure and mortality in India.
It offers new insights into the health impacts of air pollution in various agro-climatological zones of India.
Steps Taken by the Indian Govt
National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)
NCAP was launched in January 2019 to improve air quality through a city-specific action plan.
Under NCAP, India has a target to reduce 20-30% of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 2024 from 2017 levels.
PRANA Portal
It was launched to monitor the implementation of NCAP
National Air Quality Index (AQI) –
It was launched in October 2014 to disseminate information on air quality in an easily understandable form for the general public.
The measurement of air quality is based on eight pollutants, namely,
PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb
Under the authority of the
Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981
, India’s Central Pollution Control Board sets national ambient air quality standards.

**********Developing Planetary Protection Systems Against Asteroids
Why in News?
Speaking to mark the Asteroid Day 2024 (June 30), ISRO Chairman emphasised the necessity of international collaboration in developing planetary protection systems against asteroids.
He also highlighted India's ambition and qualifications to join global missions focused on asteroid research and defence prior to the Apophis asteroid and Earth having a close encounter on April 13, 2029.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is Asteroid Impact Avoidance?
India’s Journey in Planetary Defence
India’s Future in Planetary Defence
It encompasses the methods
by which near-Earth objects (NEO) on a potential collision course with Earth could be diverted away, preventing destructive impact events.
An impact by a sufficiently large asteroid or other NEOs
would cause massive tsunamis or multiple firestorms
, depending on its impact location.
A collision 66 million years ago between the Earth and an object approximately 10 km/ 6 miles wide is thought to have
Produced the
Chicxulub crater
(buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico), and
Triggered the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event that is believed to have caused the
extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs
While the chances of a major collision are low in the near term,
it is a near-certainty that one will happen eventually unless defensive measures are taken.
In 2022
, NASA spacecraft Double Asteroid Redirection Test
(DART)
impacted Dimorphous, reducing the minor-planet moon's orbital period by 32 minutes.
This mission constitutes the first successful attempt at asteroid deflection.
In 2025
, China’s CNSA plans to launch another deflection mission to near-Earth object 2019 VL5, a 30-metre-wide (100 ft.) asteroid.
This will include both an impactor and observer spacecraft.
India’s Journey in Planetary Defence:
Observing Apophis:
In 2004
, Indian observatories were able to see an object that was 340 metres in size.
They came to the conclusion that there is a substantial risk that this asteroid will reach and impact Earth.
The object is known as Apophis
, and its sphere is 360 days (almost one Earth year), and it can often be seen in the vicinity of Earth.
On April 13, 2029
, it will come to a distance of around 32,000 km away from Earth and there is a fear that if there is any change in gravity, it will have an impact on Earth in 2036.
ISRO’s plans for Apophis:
ISRO is looking to study the asteroid in 2029 in order to prepare for planetary defence efforts to prevent the asteroid from crashing onto Earth.
For this, ISRO could be collaborating with the
Apophis asteroid mission
- a joint mission of JAXA, ESA and NASA.
India’s Future in Planetary Defence:
Opportunities:
While asteroids pose potential threats to Earth,
they also offer significant opportunities for scientific discovery
, potentially revealing insights into the universe's formation and the origins of life on earth.
As a major spacefaring nation with the capability to carry out complex missions of taking a spacecraft from one place to another, India will be in a position to
Handle an asteroid mission,
Land on an asteroid, and
Possibly carry out a planetary defence action to protect Earth.
India should start by collaborating
with other nations that have already started work in this area.
For example,
Japan’s JAXA has gone to an asteroid and collected samples.
ISRO should also be a part of the
worldwide planetary defence programme
in collaboration with other agencies.
Funding challenges:

**********Why stampedes take place?   
Security Issues
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
What is a Stampede and cases related to Stampede
Mains level:
Preventive Measures to avoid stampedes
Why in the news?
On Tuesday, July 2, a stampede during a religious gathering in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district resulted in the tragic deaths of at least 121 individuals, predominantly women.
What is a Stampede?
A stampede is an impulsive mass movement of a crowd that often results in injuries and deaths.It disrupts the orderly movement of crowds, leading to injuries and fatalities, often triggered by panic, perceived danger, or the pursuit of something gratifying.
Why do Stampedes Kill?
Primary Cause:
Most stampede casualties result from traumatic asphyxia, where external compression of the chest or abdomen restricts breathing.
Other Causes
: Include myocardial infarction (heart attacks), direct crushing injuries, head injuries, and neck compression.
How Does Human Psychology Lead to Stampedes?
Panic and lacking in Cooperation:
In panic-inducing situations, cooperative behavior is initially beneficial, but if disrupted, can lead to chaotic actions like pushing and shoving.
Positive Wish-Fulfillment Beliefs:
A collective belief, rational or irrational, can mobilize large groups into actions that may compromise individual safety.
How Does the Physical Organization of Spaces Contribute to Stampedes?
Factors Contributing to Stampede Risks:
Lack of light, poor crowd flow management, structural collapses, blocked exits, and inadequate design of hardware (like doors and barriers) increase stampede risks.
Crowd Density:
High density can lead to prolonged evacuation times and increased panic.
How to Better Prevent or Mitigate Stampedes?
Planning and Design:
Ensure adequate exit points relative to crowd size, improve crowd flow management, and use technologies for real-time crowd monitoring.
Communication and Coordination:
Effective communication between organizers and attendees is crucial for issuing warnings and managing crowd movements.
Notable Deadly Stampedes and Their Causes:
Moscow, Russia (1896):
Rumors of souvenir shortages led to a deadly surge.
Allahabad, India (1954):
Lack of crowd control and barriers led to a surge at the Kumbh Mela.
Lima, Peru (1963):
Tear gas used during a football match triggered panic in enclosed spaces.
Wai, India (2005):
Slippery steps during a pilgrimage resulted in a tragic stampede.
Way forward:
Crowd Monitoring Systems
: Implement technologies such as CCTV cameras, crowd density sensors, and real-time monitoring software to detect and respond to overcrowding or sudden surges in crowd movement.
Communication Systems:
Establish robust communication networks between event organizers, security personnel, and attendees. Use public address systems and mobile alerts to convey emergency instructions and warnings promptly.
Emergency Response Plans:
Develop and rehearse comprehensive emergency response plans that include rapid evacuation procedures, medical assistance points, and coordination with local emergency services.

Mains level:
Causes of the fatal industrial accidents
Why in the news?
In May 2024, an explosion at a reactor in a chemical factory within the Dombivli Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) area caused fatalities and injuries among workers and local residents.
Present Scenario in India
India continues to witness frequent fatal industrial accidents, often due to non-compliance with safety regulations, inadequate inspections, and compromised safety practices.
Recent incidents, such as the Dombivli MIDC chemical factory explosion, highlight the recurring nature of these accidents and their devastating impact on lives and infrastructure.
There is a significant disparity between the number of registered factories and the inspection rates across states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu.
Causes of fatal industrial accidents
Non-compliance with Safety Regulations:
Many industrial accidents occur due to the failure of companies to adhere to mandated safety regulations and standards. Examples include improper maintenance of machinery, lack of safety equipment, and inadequate training of personnel in handling hazardous materials.
Inadequate Maintenance and Inspection Practices:
Poor maintenance of industrial equipment and facilities can lead to malfunctions and accidents. Insufficient or irregular inspection practices contribute to undetected hazards and safety violations that increase the risk of accidents.
Human Error and Unsafe Practices:
Accidents often result from human errors such as negligence, fatigue, or lack of training. Unsafe work practices, including shortcuts taken to save time or reduce costs, can compromise safety standards and escalate the likelihood of accidents.
Need for the right reforms
Strengthening Regulatory Framework:
Reforms should focus on updating and strengthening safety regulations to align with international standards and best practices. There is a need to close loopholes and ambiguities in existing laws to enhance clarity and enforceability.
Improving Inspection and Enforcement:
Enhancing the capacity and effectiveness of regulatory bodies responsible for inspecting industrial facilities. Increasing the number of qualified inspectors, improving their training, and implementing advanced inspection techniques like digital monitoring and real-time compliance checks.
Promoting Transparency and Accountability:
Establishing transparent mechanisms for reporting and investigating industrial accidents to identify root causes and prevent recurrence.
What can be the solution? (Way forward)
Enhanced Regulatory Oversight:
Strengthening and strictly enforcing safety regulations and standards across all industries. Regular updates to ensure regulations are comprehensive, up-to-date with technological advancements, and aligned with international best practices.
Improving Inspection and Compliance:
Increasing the number of qualified inspectors and improving their training and capabilities.Implementing regular and surprise inspections using modern technologies such as digital monitoring and remote sensing to ensure compliance with safety standards.

**********An overview of the French elections
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Election of French President
Mains level:
Impact of French on India
Why in the news?
On June 30, during the first phase of the French elections called after President Emmanuel Macron unexpectedly dissolved parliament, the far-right National Rally (RN) and its allies emerged as frontrunners with a 33% vote share.
Why did French President Emmanuel Macron decide to dissolve parliament and call for snap elections?
Strategic Decision:
Macron dissolved parliament three years early to seek a clear majority for governance. His centrist bloc suffered a major defeat in the European Parliament elections against the RN. The decision aimed to consolidate votes against the rising far-right influence.
Low Approval Ratings:
Macron’s approval ratings plummeted to 36%. The snap election was seen as a gamble to prevent the RN from gaining more power.
How did the far-right National Rally become so popular?
Rebranding and Policy Changes:
Under Marine Le Pen, the RN rebranded from the National Front (FN). The party softened its stance on extreme policies, like leaving the EU.
Response to Societal Issues:
Capitalized on fears of cultural clashes, cost-of-living crises, and dissatisfaction with Macron’s policies. Opposed immigration and advocated for ‘national priority’ policies favoring French citizens in social services.
Political Strategy:
Increased its presence in provincial towns and among blue-collar workers. Rose from 7 seats to 89 in the French parliament in 2022, aiming for 240-300 seats now.
How are the two rounds of elections conducted in France?
First Phase:
Equivalent to a qualifying round where candidates need at least 12.5% of locally registered votes.Candidates who get more than half the votes win outright.
Second Phase:
Candidates meeting the qualifying criteria move to the second round. Common practice of ‘horse-trading’ where parties form alliances to avoid splitting votes.
Overall Structure
:577 seats in the French parliament. A party needs 289 seats for an absolute majority.
Why have left-wing parties also formed a bloc?
Republican Front Strategy:
Centrist and left-wing parties team up to prevent right-wing parties from gaining power.Formation of the New Popular Front is a reference to the 1936 alliance against far-right rioters.
Electoral Tactics:
Over 200 candidates from centre and left alliances have dropped out to consolidate votes against the RN. Aimed at countering the RN’s rise and preventing fragmentation of the anti-RN vote.
Challenges and Unity:
Presence of controversial leftist figures like Jean-Luc Mélenchon has made the unity fragile.Despite internal differences, the bloc aims to present a united front against the far-right surge.
Conclusion:
The rise of the far-right National Rally in France may lead to stricter immigration policies, affecting Indian students, workers, and diaspora. Economic relations could face uncertainties, impacting trade and bilateral cooperation. So,India’s diplomatic strategies may need adjustments to navigate the changing political landscape in France.
Mains PYQ:
Critically examine the procedures through which the Presidents of India and France are elected.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
SEBI Function and Power
Mains level:
Challenges related to the Capital Market
Why in the news?
Hindenburg Research received a SEBI show cause notice for short-selling Adani Enterprises Ltd stock before and after their report accusing Adani of fraud.
What is the Hindenburg Report on Adani?
On January 24, 2023, the New York-based Hindenburg Research accused the Adani Group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.”
The report led to a significant drop in the shares of Adani companies and the calling off of Adani Enterprises Ltd’s Rs 20,000-crore follow-on Public Offer (FPO). Adani Group denied all allegations, claiming the report was a “calculated attack on India.”
What is SEBI’s show cause notice about?
Hindenburg received a show-cause notice from SEBI on June 27, 2024.SEBI alleged that Hindenburg colluded with certain entities to use non-public information to short-sell Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) stock before and after the release of its report, making profits.
The notice named Hindenburg, its founder Nathan Anderson, investor Mark Kingdon, and related entities, accusing them of sharing the report draft and building short positions in AEL futures.
How has Hindenburg responded to the show cause notice?
Hindenburg dismissed the notice as an attempt to silence those exposing corruption. They stated their investment stance was legal and disclosed, and criticized SEBI for targeting them instead of investigating the Adani Group’s alleged malpractices.
Accusations:
Hindenburg accused SEBI of pressuring brokers to close short positions in Adani stocks to protect the stock prices.
Where does Kotak come into this picture?
Involvement of Kotak:
SEBI’s notice did not name Kotak Bank, which Hindenburg claims created the offshore fund structure used for shorting Adani stocks.
Response:
Kotak Mahindra Bank stated that Hindenburg has never been a client and that their KYC procedures were followed with regard to clients, with investments made by Kingdon as a principal.
How much profit did Hindenburg earn by short selling Adani stocks?
Revenue:
Hindenburg earned approximately $4.1 million in gross revenue through gains related to Adani shorts from its investor relationship.
Own Short Position:
Hindenburg made about $31,000 from their short of Adani US bonds.After legal and research expenses, Hindenburg indicated they might only slightly come out ahead of break-even on their Adani short.
Way forward:
Conduct Investigation
: SEBI should initiate an independent, comprehensive investigation into the allegations against both Adani Group and Hindenburg Research. This investigation should be conducted by a neutral third party to ensure impartiality and transparency.
Policy Review:
SEBI could review and possibly update its regulations on short-selling and market manipulation to prevent similar incidents in the future. This could include stricter disclosure requirements for short sellers and enhanced monitoring of market activities.
Mains PYQ:
The product diversification of financial institutions and insurance companies, resulting in overlapping of products and services strengthens the case for the merger of the two regulatory agencies, namely SEBI and IRDA. Justify.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Diseases spread by Mosquitoes; Factors driving mosquito evolution.
Why in the News?
A study published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)
1 has suggested that a pair of hormones work together to activate or suppress mosquitoes’ blood cravings.
Mosquito Species and Behavior
There are around
3500 mosquito species globally
, found on every continent except Antarctica.
Female mosquitoes consume blood
to aid in egg development.
After feeding
, female mosquitoes
lose their appetite
for blood until they lay their eggs.
Research by Michael Strand and Team
Strand observed that levels of the
mosquito gut hormone F (NPF)
spiked when mosquitoes were seeking a host and dropped after feeding.
Their study analyzed
mosquito enteroendocrine cells
responsible for gut hormone production.
Hormonal Mechanisms:
NPF levels increased
before blood meals
and decreased six hours after feeding.
Another
gut hormone, RYamide, was found to influence
mosquitoes’ blood lust. As NPF levels decreased after a blood meal, RYamide levels increased, and vice versa.
The researchers concluded that
NPF and RYamide work together
to regulate mosquitoes’ attraction to humans and other hosts.
Implications of the Study
Controlling the Deadliest Animal
: Mosquitoes are the deadliest animal on the planet, acting as vectors for diseases such as malaria, dengue, West Nile virus, yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya, and lymphatic filariasis, which collectively kill more people than any other creature.
Pesticide Development
: The discovery could lead to new pesticide targets for preventing mosquito reproduction and disease transmission.
Note:
Mosquitoes are responsible for over
1 million human deaths per year worldwide
. They transmit deadly diseases like malaria, yellow fever, dengue, and Zika virus
PYQ:

**********Universe had Spiral Galaxies 4 billion years sooner than expected: Study
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Formation of Universe; Spiral Galaxy.
Why in the News?
A new study has revealed more spiral galaxies in the universe’s youth than astronomers had previously expected.
Universe’s Age and Galaxy Types
The universe is about
13.8 billion years old
and hosts various kinds of galaxies, from spiral to elliptical.
Astronomers believed
spiral galaxies formed about 6 billion years ago
, but the new study calls this into question.
Younger galaxies tend to spiral
, while
older ones have a variety of shapes
, making the study of older galaxies more challenging due to fainter light.
Back2Basics: Spiral Galaxy
Spiral galaxies are a type of galaxy characterized by their
spiral structure
They are among the
most common types
of galaxies in the universe.
Our own
Milky Way
is a classic example of a spiral galaxy.
Key Characteristics:
Central Bulge
: A dense, spherical structure at the centre composed mainly of older stars.
Disk
: Surrounding the bulge is a flat, rotating disk of stars, gas, and dust. The disk contains younger stars and spiral arms.
Spiral Arms
: These are the defining features, winding outward from the central bulge. The arms are sites of active star formation and appear brighter due to the presence of young, hot stars.
Halo
: A roughly spherical region surrounding the disk, containing old stars and globular clusters.
Formation and Evolution
Spiral galaxies are thought to form from the
gravitational collapse of gas and dust
in the early universe.
maintain their structure through the rotation
of the disk and the gravitational influence of the central bulge and halo.
Interactions and mergers with other galaxies
can distort or destroy their spiral structure, potentially transforming them into
elliptical galaxies
Formation of Galaxies
As the universe cooled from a dense plasma state, hot gas formed clumps that became galaxies.
These early galaxies had irregular shapes and lacked disks.
Spiral Formation Theory
The traditional theory suggested that it took billions of years for hot, thick disks to become thinner and form spiral arms.
The new study suggests that cooling and spiral formation occur around the same cosmic time.
How is this verified?
Astronomers observe star formation in real time but study galaxy evolution through
“astronomical archaeology.”
Understanding the fraction of spiral galaxies helps astronomers trace the biography of galaxies.
Infrared and optical wavelengths
are used to detect early galaxies, requiring powerful telescopes due to the faint light of older galaxies.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
launched in
2021
has enabled astronomers to
study deeper into the universe’s past.
Study Methodology:
The University of Missouri team used the JWST to study 873 galaxies and identified at least 216 spiral galaxies, some dating to 1.5 billion years after the universe’s birth.
Each of the six authors classified the images as spiral or non-spiral, ensuring the result is free of human bias.
Findings and Implications
The fraction of spiral galaxies
increased from about 8% to 48%
between 3 billion and 7 billion years
after the Big Bang, higher than previously observed.
The study
challenges existing models
and suggests that galaxy formation theories need to be more complex.
PYQ:
[2022]
Launched on 25th December, 2021, James Webb Space Telescope has been much in the news since then. What are its unique features which make it superior to its predecessor Space Telescopes? What are the key goals of this mission? What potential benefits does it hold for the human race?

About Great Indian Bustards
GIBs are the
largest among the four bustard species found in India
, the other three being MacQueen’s bustard, the lesser florican, and the Bengal florican.
GIBs’ historic range included much of the Indian sub-continent but it has now shrunken to just 10 percent of it.
Among the heaviest birds with flight, GIBs
prefer grasslands
as their habitats.
GIBs are mainly found in
Desert National Park
, Rajasthan.
Bustards face major threats, including
habitat changes
collisions with power lines
Protection accorded:
Birdlife International:
uplisted from Endangered to Critically Endangered (2011)
Protection under CITES
: Appendix I
IUCN status:
Protection under Wildlife (Protection) Act:
Schedule I
What is the GIB Recovery Plan?
The proposal was prepared by the
Wildlife Institute of India (WII)
The proposal includes:
Rewilding Bustards bred in ex-situ conservation centres,
Conducting detailed population studies, and
Developing artificial insemination techniques.
Back2Basics: Wildlife Institute of India (WII)
WII is an
autonomous institution
under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
It was established in 1982.
It is based in
Dehradun
, Uttarakhand.
Functions:
It offers training programs, academic courses, and advisory in wildlife research and management.
Why such a move?
Indicator Species
: The GIB is a key indicator species of grassland habitat, signalling the health of these environments.
Population Decline
: The population has declined from around 700 individuals to less than 150 due to habitat loss, predation, and death by overhead power lines.
Supreme Court Order
: The Supreme Court recognized the threat from power lines and constituted an expert committee to assess the feasibility of overhead and underground electric lines in the bustard’s habitats.
Conservation Efforts and Achievements
: Initial efforts began between 2012-2013 with a long-term recovery project, which firmed up in 2016 with a Rs 33.85 crore funding outlay.
Funding and Agreements
: The project was funded by the Compensatory Afforestation Fund, with a tripartite agreement in 2018 involving the Environment Ministry, Rajasthan Forest Department, and WII.
In-Situ Breeding
: Conservation breeding began in 2019, resulting in a founder population of 40 GIBs at the Ramdevra centre.
Achievements at Breeding Centres
Successful Breeding
: Eggs collected from the wild were incubated and chicks were hand-reared. The breeding centres now have a founder population of 40 GIBs.
Scientific Reasoning
: Creating a founder population prevents extirpation and captures genetic variability. The goal is to have at least 20 adult birds including 15 females.
Future Plans
Next Phase (2024-2033)
: The immediate next phase will run until 2029, targeting the upgradation of the CBC at Ramdevra and the development of the Lesser Florican CBC at Sorsan.
Population Surveys
: Surveys will be conducted in Rajasthan and other range states to monitor population status.
Release into the Wild
: The most important target is releasing captive-bred GIBs into the wild, preceded by soft release in enclosures.

**********Significance of ‘Abhaya Mudra’
History and Art & Culture
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Various mudras of Buddha
Why in the News?
The Leader of Opposition invoked the
in his inaugural address as Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha.
What is Abhay
Mudra?
Abhaya mudra, the
motif of an open palm
(gesturing to stop), is prevalent across many South Asian religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism.
Known as the
‘fearlessness gesture’
, ‘abhaya’ in Sanskrit means fearlessness. The gesture symbolizes protection and peace.
In
yoga
circles, the abhaya mudra is believed to
promote courage and reduce fear and anxiety.
While common across many religions, the abhaya mudra is most
prominently featured in Buddhism
especially in Thailand and Laos
, where it is associated with images of the walking Buddha.
Origins of the Gesture
According to Stanford University, the gesture of an open palm pointed outwards appears to be a
natural gesture used since prehistoric times
as a sign of good intentions and peace.
The gesture also asserted power in antiquity, similar to the
magna manus
of the Roman Emperors
who legislated and gave peace simultaneously.
The motif likely originated from a
universal gesture
associated with human communication, eventually integrating into major South Asian religions.
Abhaya Mudra in Buddhism
In Buddhism, the abhaya mudra is
linked to a legend
involving Devadatta
cousin of the Buddha
, who
tried to murder the Buddha
by losing a rampaging elephant into his path.
Buddha calmed the elephant
displaying the abhaya mudra
, indicating appeasement of the senses and the absence of fear.
The gesture is popularly
pronounced in Buddhist cultures
, symbolizing fearlessness and peace.
Evolution of Mudras in Buddhism
For about 500 years after the Buddha, he was
not depicted in physical form
Early representations appeared around the
first millennium
, influenced by
Gandhara and Gupta art
With the evolution of these Buddhist traditions, hundreds of mudras entered Buddhist iconography.
In tantric Buddhist traditions, mudras symbolized material offerings, enacted forms of worship, or relationships with visualized deities.
Other key Mudras in Buddhism:
: <discussed above>.
Dharmachakra Mudra
: Symbolizes the “Teaching of the Wheel of Dharma.” Both hands are held against the chest, left inward, right outward.
Dhyan Mudra
: Gesture of meditation and concentration. Hands are placed on the lap, right over left, thumbs touching.
Bhumisparsa Mudra
: Represents the moment of Buddha’s enlightenment. A right hand touches the ground, palm inward.
Varada Mudra
: Signifies offering, charity, and sincerity. The right hand is forward with fingers extended, left palm near the navel.
Karana Mudra
: Warding off evil and reducing negative thoughts. Index and little fingers are raised, other fingers folded.
Vajra Mudra
: Symbolizes the fiery thunderbolt and five elements. Right fist encloses left hand’s erect forefinger.
Vitarka Mudra
: Represents the transmission of Buddha’s teachings. The thumb and index finger tips are joined, other fingers are extended.
Uttarabodhi Mudra
: Denotes supreme enlightenment. Hands are at the heart, index fingers touching and pointing upwards.
Anjali Mudra
: Gesture of greeting, prayer, and adoration. Hands are pressed together at the heart chakra, thumbs against the sternum.
Abhaya Mudra in Hindu Religion
The Buddha was
absorbed into the Hindu pantheon
as the 9th
incarnation of Vishnu.
Hindus regarded the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu
between AD 450 and the sixth century
, with the
first mention in the Vishnu Purana
(400-500 CE).
The abhaya mudra
appears in depictions of Hindu deities
, commonly seen in images of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Ganesha.
PYQ:
[2014]
Lord Buddha’s image is sometimes shown with a hand gesture called ‘Bhumisparsha Mudra’. It symbolizes:
(a) Buddha’s calling of the Earth to watch over Mara and to prevent Mara from disturbing his meditation
(b) Buddha’s calling of the Earth to witness his purity and chastity despite the temptations of Mara
(c) Buddha’s reminder to his followers that they all arise from the Earth and finally dissolve into the Earth and thus this life is transitory
(d) Both the statements ‘a’ and ‘b’ are correct in this context
Gandhara sculpture owed as much to the Romans as to the Greeks. Explain.
[2016]
Early Buddhist Stupa-art, while depicting folk motifs and narratives, successfully expounds Buddhist ideals. Elucidate.
