Deepwater transshipment port
Vizhinjam international seaport project
Deepwater port
A deepwater port is a manmade structure that are used as ports or terminals to transport, store, or handle oil or natural gas.
These structures can be fixed or floating, and are located beyond state seaward boundaries.
They can include: Pipelines, Pumping stations, Service platforms, Mooring buoys.
Transshipment port
A transshipment port is a port where goods are offloaded and loaded onto a different ship to continue their journey to their final destination.
Why India needs a container transshipment port?
Lacks infrastructure to deal with ultra-large container ships
India has
13 major ports
. However, the
country lacks a landside mega-port and terminal infrastructure to deal with ultra-large container ships
Hence, nearly 75 per cent of India’s transshipment cargo is handled at ports
outside India, mainly Colombo, Singapore, and Klang
In fiscal 2021-22, the total transshipment cargo of India was about 4.6 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), out of which about 4.
2 million TEUs were handled outside India
Other benefits
Developing such ports will accrue
significant benefits such as forex savings
, foreign direct investment, increased economic activity at other Indian Ports.
It will also lead to the
development of related logistics infrastructure
, employment generation, improved operation/logistics efficiencies and increase in revenue share.
Several other
allied businesses
ship chandlery-ship supplies, ship repair, crew change facility, logistics value-added services, warehousing and bunkering also come up at the transshipment port.
Increased economic activities
A deepwater container transshipment port can attract a
large share of the container transshipment traffic
Currently, this is being diverted to Colombo, Singapore and Dubai.
It can also ensure India’s economic development and open up immense job opportunities.
Vizhinjam International Seaport Project
Located in Vizhinjam (near Thiruvananthapuram), Kerala, this transshipment deepwater multipurpose seaport project is being built by Adani Ports and SEZ Private Limited.
It is being built on a design,
build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) model
DBFOT model is a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. In this model, a private partner is responsible for:
Designing the project
Building the project
Financing the project
Operating the project during the contracted period
Transferring the project back to the public sector
The DBFOT model is usually used for large-scale infrastructure projects.
The private partner is granted a concession by the public sector to finance, design, construct, own, and operate the project for a period of 20 to 30 years.
After that period, the project is returned to the public entity that originally granted the concession.
According to the agreement, out of the total investment, Adani Group is supposed to invest Rs 2,454 crore and another Rs 1,635 crore will be mobilised from the state and central governments as viability gap funding.
The Kerala government has also gave 500 acres of land.
DBFOT deal is for 40 years, with provisions extending for 20 years
Features of the Vizhinjam port
India’s first international deepwater transshipment port
This is India’s first international deepwater transshipment port with a natural depth of more than 18 meters, scalable up to 20 meters.
This depth is crucial to get large vessels and mother ships.
It is designed to cater to container transshipment, multi-purpose, and break-bulk cargo.
The cost of movement of containers to and from foreign destinations is likely to come down.
Strategic location
The port is located
ten nautical miles from the international shipping route
The port is expected to compete with Colombo, Singapore, and Dubai for winning trans-shipment traffic.
Increased capacity and minimum maintenance
Its capacity in the first phase is one million TEU, which can be increased to 6.2 million TEU.
Other features include minimal littoral drift along the coast and virtually no requirement for any maintenance dredging.
Economic benefits
The project is expected to generate 5,000 direct job opportunities, apart from giving a boost to an industrial corridor and cruise tourism.
Vizhinjam port offers
large-scale automation for quick turnaround of vessels
with state-of-the-art infrastructure to handle Megamax container ships.

India has called on the seven-nation Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) grouping to infuse new energies, resources, and a fresh commitment to bolster cooperation among the Bay of Bengal countries.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About BIMSTEC (Background, Objectives, Members, Focus Areas, Challenges, etc.)
News Summary
About BIMSTEC:
The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional organization founded in
1997
to promote economic cooperation and technical collaboration among countries bordering the Bay of Bengal.
The BIMSTEC region is
home to more than 1.7 billion people
which constitute around 23% of the global population.
Member Countries:
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand
Objectives:
Foster economic growth and development.
Enhance regional connectivity and integration.
Promote cooperation across various sectors such as trade, technology, energy, and transportation.
Priority Sectors:
Trade and Investment:
Boosting intra-regional trade and investments.
Technology:
Sharing technological advancements.
Energy:
Collaborating on renewable and sustainable energy projects.
Transportation:
Improving regional connectivity.
Tourism:

Trade Dynamics:
According to industry insiders, Intra-regional trade among BIMSTEC countries is above US$40 billion and the
potential trade opportunity evolving the BIMSTEC nations seems to be as high as US$250 billion
Notably, BIMSTEC countries constitute around 3.8% of world trade meaning that it has an immense potential to be a game-changer of the global south economy.
Presently, about 60% of BIMSTEC’s combined GDP at present comes from trade.
Currently,
India’s export share in BIMSTEC is about 50% (US$21 billion)
, followed by Thailand 30% (US$12.2 billion) and Myanmar 14% (US$6.1 billion).
Over 40% of BIMSTEC’s intra-regional trade is ocean-borne
, demonstrating the need for maritime connectivity.
Challenges for BIMSTEC as an Organisation:
Intra-regional trade and investment are relatively lower in the BIMSTEC region as compared to other regional blocs.
One of the major reasons for this low level of trade and investment is
inadequate infrastructure
Moreover,
lack of connectivity and information dissemination
in the region appears as a common barrier for tap BIMSTEC-led opportunities.
Regarding border trade, lack of telecommunication links, parking space, warehouses and cold storage, accommodation facilities and power are major constraints.
News Summary:
India has urged the BIMSTEC group to bring new energy, resources, and commitment to enhance cooperation among its member countries.
This call was made by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar during a two-day retreat with his counterparts from the seven BIMSTEC nations: India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Nepal, and Bhutan.

**********Threats Posed by Asteroids and Need for Planetary Defence
Why in News?
Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Chairman S Somanath recently showed its intent to develop capabilities in planetary defence - an area it has so far not entered.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Intent of ISRO?
Threats from Space and the Need of a Planetary Defence Programme
Why is Apophis Considered an Alarming Asteroid?
The Indian space agency might send its own spacecraft to the
asteroid Apophis
, when it passes by Earth at a distance of 32,000 km in 2029.
As NASA's mission to the asteroid Apophis has already been confirmed, ISRO may also collaborate with other space agencies.
A mission to study an asteroid would be the
first step towards building a programme aimed at preventing celestial bodies from colliding with Earth
with potentially catastrophic consequences.
Threats from Space and the Need of a Planetary Defence Programme:
Background:
The planets of the Solar System were born in a violent storm of asteroid-like objects that began 4.6 thousand million years ago and lasted for roughly 500 million years.
It's ironic that this process, which at first helped life emerge by supplying the planet with valuable organic compounds, is now posing a threat to it.
The planets failed to consume all of the asteroids and the
planetary leftovers are still orbiting the Sun today
Most of them are confined to the ‘main belt’ of asteroids, in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
They may be pushed out by the planets' gravitational pull and fall in the direction of the Sun, which means that they may cross Earth’s orbit and potentially collide with it.
Threats from asteroids:
Asteroids are headed towards Earth all the time and thousands enter the Earth’s atmosphere every day.
Most are very small and burn up in the atmosphere due to friction. Some of the larger ones burn spectacularly, and show up as fireballs in the sky.
In some cases, unburnt fragments make it to the surface, although they are not large enough to cause much damage.
However, a 20-metre-wide asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded about 30 km above a Russian town in 2013.
This resulted in the release of energy ~30 times the energy released by the atom bomb that detonated over Hiroshima.
Need of a planetary defence programme:
An asteroid was detected only after it entered the atmosphere
because it came from the direction of the Sun, and was hidden by its glare.
At least 1.3 million asteroids are known to scientists, although there may be more surprising discoveries.
A planetary defence programme seeks to track and neutralise these threats.
When Apophis was discovered in 2004, scientists thought there was
a 2.7% chance of a collision with Earth
- the highest probability of any large asteroid hitting Earth in the recent past.
Initial observations showed that if not in 2029 (when it will come the closest to Earth and flying by at a distance of 32,000 km), Apophis could hit Earth in 2036 or 2068.
Given the asteroid’s size -
scientists believe that a collision with Earth could cause large-scale damage
, drawing comparison with the event that wiped out dinosaurs and most other extant life some 66 million years ago.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Upper Siang; Brahmaputra River.
Why in the News?
Activists are protesting against the
About Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Project
The Upper Siang project is a proposed
11,000 MW hydropower project
on the
Siang River
in Arunachal Pradesh.
The Siang,
originating near Mount Kailash
in Tibet (Tsangpo),
flows over 1,000 km eastward
, enters Arunachal Pradesh as the Siang, and
later
becomes the Brahmaputra
in Assam.
Initially proposed as
two separate projects
, it was
consolidated into one larger project in 2017
, to be built by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), featuring a
300-metre high dam
Strategic Importance:
The Upper Siang project is seen as a
strategic move to counter China’s hydel projects
on the Tsangpo, particularly a 60,000 MW ‘
super dam’ in Tibet’s
Medog county
This super dam’s capacity is nearly
3x that of the Three Gorges Dam in China
and is intended to divert water to northern China.
Environmental and Social Concerns
Anti-dam organizations express concerns about the
project’s environmental and social impact
in their memorandum.
The memorandum highlights the
threat to delicate ecosystems, wildlife habitats, and biodiversity
in Arunachal Pradesh, which already hosts numerous dams.
The activists are particularly worried about the
displacement of communities
, as the project could submerge over 300 villages of the
Adi
tribe
, including the district headquarters of Yingkiong.
Activists are also wary of the project’s portrayal as a
national interest endeavor
and are troubled by a provision in the
Forest (Conservation) Amendment Act

**********Impose ‘Robot Tax’ for AI-induced Job Loss: RSS
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), wants a ‘
robot tax’
to help employees who lose their jobs because
companies are using Artificial Intelligence (AI).
SJM’s Proposals and Suggestions
Robot Tax Proposal:
SJM proposes a ‘robot tax’ to create a fund supporting workers displaced by AI adoption to upskill and adapt to new technologies.
Tax Incentives for Job Creation:
Suggestions include tax incentives for industries based on their employment-output ratio to encourage job creation.
Fund for Worker Upskilling:
Emphasizes the need for economic measures to cope with the human cost of AI. SJM suggests using a ‘robot tax’ to fund worker upskilling programs.
Additional Budgetary Recommendations
Incentivise job creation:
SJM suggests tax incentives for industries generating more employment, based on an employment-output ratio.
Subsidies for Small Farmers:
SJM proposes subsidies for micro irrigation projects to boost productivity among small farmers.
SJM recommends that micro-irrigation projects be made eligible for funding via CSR by adding them to Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013.
Wealth tax on Vacant Lands:
SJM suggests a wealth tax on “vacant land” to discourage unnecessary landholding for future requirements.
What is a Robot Tax?
A robot tax is a proposed tax on
companies that use automation and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
to replace human workers.
The idea behind this tax is
to generate revenue
that can be used
to support workers
due to automation.
This can include retraining programs, unemployment benefits, and other forms of social support.
Need for a Robot Tax
Job Displacement:
Automation Impact:
AI and automation can lead to significant job losses in various industries as machines and software perform tasks previously done by humans.
Worker Support:
A robot tax can provide financial resources to support displaced workers, helping them transition to new roles or acquire new skills.
Economic Inequality:
Wealth Distribution:
Automation tends to concentrate wealth among those who own the technology, leading to increased economic inequality.
Redistribution:
Taxing companies that benefit from automation can help redistribute wealth more fairly across society.
Funding for Public Programs:
Social Safety Nets:
Revenue from a robot tax can fund social safety nets such as unemployment benefits, retraining programs, and other social services.
Infrastructure:
It can also support public infrastructure projects and other initiatives that benefit society as a whole.
Incentivising Human Employment:
Employment Decisions:
By imposing a tax on automation, companies might be more inclined to consider human workers over robots for certain tasks.
Balanced Approach:
This can help maintain a balance between technological advancement and human employment.
Examples and Proposals
Bill Gates’ Proposal:
Bill Gates in 2022 advocated for a robot tax, suggesting that the revenue could fund job retraining and other social benefits.
European Parliament:
In 2017, the European Parliament considered a robot tax as part of broader regulations on AI and robotics, though it was ultimately not implemented.
Criticisms and Challenges
Implementation:
Determining how to effectively implement and enforce a robot tax can be challenging.
Innovation Stifling:
Critics argue that a robot tax could hinder innovation and technological progress.
Global Competition:
There are concerns that companies might relocate to countries without such a tax, affecting global competitiveness.
Conclusion
A robot tax is a controversial yet potentially beneficial approach to addressing the economic and social impacts of AI and automation.
It aims to provide support for displaced workers, reduce economic inequality, and ensure that the benefits of technological advancements are shared more broadly across society.
PYQ:
[2013]
Disguised unemployment generally means:
(a) large number of people remain unemployed
(b) alternative employment is not available
(c) marginal productivity of labour is zero
(d) productivity of workers is low
**********Why are dengue cases on the rise worldwide?     
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
How dengue spread?
Mains level:
Are urbanisation and climate change fuelling dengue spread in the world?
Why in the news?
In recent weeks, there has been an increase in dengue cases, notably in Karnataka, with rising numbers also observed in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
What is the global situation of dengue?
Epidemiological Burden:
In 2024, over 7.6 million cases of dengue were reported globally, with 3.4 million confirmed cases and significant numbers of severe cases and deaths. Dengue affects approximately half of the world’s population, with an estimated 100-400 million infections occurring annually.
Geographical Distribution:
Dengue transmission occurs in 90 countries worldwide, predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions. The disease is endemic in more than 100 countries across WHO regions, including Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific.
Urbanization:
Increased Population Density:
Urban areas provide optimal conditions for the Aedes aegypti mosquito due to the availability of breeding sites like stagnant water in containers, tires, and other urban infrastructure.
Expansion of Cities:
Rapid urbanization leads to unplanned growth, inadequate waste management, and inadequate water supply, creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
Human Movement:
Urbanization facilitates increased human mobility, enabling the spread of the dengue virus through infected individuals travelling between urban centers.
Climate Change:
Temperature and Rainfall Patterns:
Warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns associated with climate change create favourable conditions for mosquito breeding and survival.
Shifts in Geographic Distribution:
Changing climate allows Aedes mosquitoes to expand their range to new regions previously unaffected by dengue, including temperate climates.
Extreme Weather Events:
Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like hurricanes and floods provide breeding opportunities for mosquitoes and facilitate virus transmission.
Impact:
Health Impact:
India accounts for an estimated 33 million clinically apparent dengue cases each year, contributing to a third of the global dengue burden
Economic Impact:
A cost analysis study in southern India estimated the direct medical costs per hospitalized dengue patient at around ₹20,000 in 2017-18, with costs soaring to over ₹61,000 for complications requiring intensive care.
Impact on Individuals:
Dengue can cause a wide spectrum of illness, from mild flu-like symptoms to severe complications like internal bleeding, organ impairment, and potentially death if not treated promptly.
Way forward:
Enhance Urban Infrastructure:
Improve urban planning to include effective waste management, regular clearing of stagnant water sources, and sustainable water supply systems to reduce mosquito breeding grounds.
Public Awareness Campaigns:
Launch comprehensive public awareness campaigns focusing on urban populations to promote community involvement in mosquito control measures and encourage responsible waste disposal practices.
Mains PYQ:
Public health system has limitation in providing universal health coverage. Do you think that private sector can help in bridging the gap? What other viable alternatives do you suggest?

Why in the news?
Following World Population Day (July 11), amidst discussions on global population dynamics, it is essential to highlight a topic often overlooked in conversations about reproductive health: male infertility.
World Health Organization (WHO) Global Perspective on infertility:
Prevalence:
WHO estimates that 60 million to 80 million couples worldwide experience infertility.
Male vs. Female Infertility:
Globally, male infertility accounts for approximately 50% of all infertility cases.
Issues Specific to India:
Data Deficiency:
Unlike global estimates, specific prevalence data for infertility in India are outdated (from ICMR guidelines in 2005) and not comprehensive.
Male Infertility:
In India, male infertility constitutes a significant portion of all infertility cases, estimated to be around 50%, mirroring global trends.
Contributing Factors:
Unique challenges in India include environmental pollution, pesticide exposure in agriculture, lifestyle changes including late marriages and stress, which contribute to rising infertility rates.
Access to Treatment:
Disparities in access to advanced infertility treatments exist, with urban areas having better access compared to rural regions.
Cultural and Social Stigma:
Infertility remains stigmatized in Indian society, affecting mental health and social well-being of affected couples, and hindering open discussions and seeking timely medical help.
Male Factors:
Low sperm count (oligospermia) or poor sperm motility (asthenozoospermia). Anatomical issues such as blocked sperm ducts or varicocele. Hormonal imbalances, genetic factors, and environmental influences like exposure to toxins.
Female Factors:
Ovulation disorders, including hormonal imbalances like PCOS. Structural issues like blocked fallopian tubes or uterine abnormalities. Endometriosis, is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.
Shared Factors:
Age-related decline in fertility. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and obesity. Medical conditions like cancer and its treatments, autoimmune disorders, and certain medications affecting fertility.
Treatment options
Semen Analysis:
Essential for diagnosing male infertility, conducted after a period of sexual abstinence.
Medical Consultation:
Vital to identify underlying causes, whether physical (e.g., blocked sperm flow, anatomical issues) or genetic.
Corrective Surgeries:
Address issues like blocked sperm ducts, undescended testicles, or anatomical abnormalities affecting sperm production and flow.
Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART):
Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI):
Effective for cases of severe male infertility where sperm count is extremely low.
Intrauterine Insemination (IUI):
Suitable when sperm motility is good but count is low, facilitating fertilization within the uterus.
In vitro Fertilisation (IVF):
Used when both sperm count and motility are low, involving fertilization outside the body before implantation.
Donor Sperm Insemination or Adoption:
Options for couples where male infertility is irreparable, providing alternative paths to parenthood.
Way forward:
Enhanced Data Collection and Research:
Update and expand prevalence data on infertility in India through national surveys and research initiatives. This should include both urban and rural populations to understand regional disparities.
Public Awareness and Support Programs:
Launch nationwide campaigns to raise awareness about infertility as a medical condition, debunk myths, and reduce stigma.
Mains PYQ:

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
EV policy
Mains level:
Revised policy can align with India’s goals of enhancing local manufacturing
Why in the news?
The government plans to expand its EV policy to include retrospective benefits, incentivizing entities that have already invested, with a formal announcement expected in August.
Why is the government considering extending the EV policy?
Retrospective Effect:
To include a retrospective effect, extending benefits to entities that have already made investments, aiming to reward and encourage early movers in the EV sector.
Encouraging Global Players:
The policy seeks to prompt global players to localize production and invest in the domestic ecosystem.
Inclusive Incentives:
Earlier, entities were eligible for incentives only if they set up local facilities within three years of receiving approval. The extension aims to make these incentives more inclusive.
EV Policy of India:
FAME Scheme:
The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme is India’s flagship program to incentivize EV adoption. FAME-II, the current phase, provides incentives of:
₹15,000 per kWh for 2-wheelers, up to 40% of the vehicle cost
₹10,000 per kWh for 3-wheelers and 4-wheelers
₹20,000 per kWh for electric buses
Phased Manufacturing Program (PMP):
To boost local manufacturing, the government has implemented a Phased Manufacturing Program that gradually increases import duties on EV components over time, incentivizing domestic production.
About the New EV Policy 2024:
The key highlights of the new EV policy announced in 2024 include:
Reduced customs duty of 15% on imported EVs with a minimum CIF value of $35,000
A cap of 8,000 imported EVs per year
Requirement for manufacturers to invest at least ₹4,150 crore (~$500 million) and achieve 25% domestic value addition within 3 years, escalating to 50% in 5 years
Duty waiver capped at the investment made or ₹6,484 crore (equal to the PLI scheme incentive), whichever is lower.
How does the revised policy align with India’s goals of enhancing local manufacturing and technology adoption in the EV industry?
Domestic Value Addition:
The policy mandates that half of the value addition in manufacturing be done domestically within five years, boosting local manufacturing.
Import Duty Reduction:
Reducing import duty on EVs with a minimum CIF value of $35,000 from 70%-100% to 15% to make the transition commercially viable.
Strengthening EV Ecosystem:
By encouraging local production and investment, the policy aims to strengthen the entire EV ecosystem in India.
Global Leadership:
Positioning India as a leader in the global transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles by fostering a sustainable and technologically advanced manufacturing environment.
In what ways can the policy’s focus on localization and production volume increase competition and lower costs?
Economies of Scale:
Higher volumes of production can lead to economies of scale, reducing the per-unit cost of EVs.
Healthy Competition:
Encouraging competition among EV players to innovate and improve efficiency, thereby lowering production costs and prices for consumers.
Cost Reduction:
Achieving higher production volumes and localized manufacturing will contribute to a significant decline in production costs, making EVs more affordable for Indian consumers.
Comprehensive Ecosystem:
The focus on localization ensures the development of a robust supply chain and after-sales service network, further enhancing the viability and attractiveness of EVs in India.
Way forward:
