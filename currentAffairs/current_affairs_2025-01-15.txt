**********What is Zombie Deer Disease?
Scientists express concern over the possibility of the deadly and incurable 'zombie deer' disease affecting humans.
About Zombie Deer Disease:
Known scientifically as
Chronic Wasting Disease
(CWD), it is a
progressive and fatal neurological disease
which
primarily affects deer,
elk, moose, and reindeer.
What causes CWD?
It is caused
by infectious proteins called prions
Prions are
misfolded proteins
that cause other proteins in the brain to likewise misfold, ultimately
leading to brain damage.
Once these proteins accumulate in the brain, they create spongy holes in the tissue,
resulting in severe neurological dysfunction.
Transmission
CWD prions
highly contagious
spread through body fluids
such as saliva, faeces, blood, or urine, either
by direct contact or environmental contamination.
Once present in an area
prions remain
infectious in soil, water, and plants
for years
, posing long-term risks to animal populations.
Symptoms
It has an
extended incubation period
averaging 18–24 months
between infection and the onset of noticeable signs. During this time frame, animals look and act normal.
The most obvious sign of CWD is
progressive weight loss.
Numerous
behavioral changes
also been reported, including
decreased social interaction
, loss of awareness, and
loss of fear of humans.
Diseased animals also may exhibit
increased drinking, urinatio
n, and excessive salivation.
Treatment
: It is
always fatal
in infected animals. There is
no vaccine or treatment.
Can Humans Get
So far,
there has been
no confirmed case of CWD transmission to humans
. However, experts remain cautious.

**********Delhi Must Look Beyond H-1B
Context
Donald Trump's potential return to the White House has sparked significant debate in India,
with discussions often focused narrowly on the H-1B visa controversy.
However, while
the export of Indian technical talent to the United States remains an important issue,
the broader implications of Trump’s technology policies warrant closer examination.
These policies are poised to reshape not only the domestic and global technology landscape but also the geopolitical dynamics
between major powers, including India, China, and the United States.
An Assessment of Different Aspects of H-1B Visa Debate
The Centrality of H-1B Visas in India-U.S. Relations
The H-1B visa program is a
cornerstone of India’s engagement with the United States.
It enables highly skilled Indian professionals, particularly in technology, to contribute significantly to America’s innovation and economic growth.
However, the
intensifying debate surrounding this program reflects deeper divisions within American society
about immigration policies, encompassing economic, political, and cultural dimensions with implications for India.
Economic Imperatives Driving the H-1B Debate
At its core,
the H-1B visa debate revolves around balancing economic benefits with domestic concerns
about immigration.
Technology companies and industries reliant on skilled labour advocate for expanding the program
, highlighting its role in addressing labour shortages, driving innovation, and ensuring America’s competitive edge.
As India supplies a significant proportion of H-1B workers,
the program creates a mutual benefit for both nations.
Anti-Immigration Sentiments and Political Polarisation
Critics argue that reliance on foreign workers suppresses wages for American citizens
, perpetuating income inequality and favouring corporations over labour.
This
sentiment is shared by the traditional left, which opposes immigration on economic grounds,
and the liberal left, which supports immigration from a humanitarian perspective rather than an economic one.
Trump’s Dual Approach to Immigration Policies
While emphasising stricter oversight and prioritising American workers
, his administration
also acknowledged the strategic importance of skilled immigration
for maintaining America’s scientific and technological leadership.
This dual approach
, supporting legal, high-skill immigration while restricting illegal and low-skill entry,
resonated with many American voters.
Opportunities and Challenges for India
U.S. technology sector’s continued demand for Indian talent reinforces India’s role
as a vital source of skilled labour.
addressing American concerns, such as illegal immigration, can bolster India’s credibility
in advocating for an expanded and efficient H-1B program.
The Strategic Significance of Skilled Immigration
Beyond the immediate concerns of the H-1B program,
this debate underscores the broader strategic context of India-U.S. relations.
Skilled immigration is not merely an economic issue but
a reflection of deeper interdependencies between the two nations.
As America navigates its internal divisions on immigration,
India must position itself as a reliable partner,
advocating for policies that benefit both countries while addressing mutual concerns.
Key Features of Trump’s Potential Second Term
The Domestic Political Shift in Technology
Recent years have revealed that technology is far from politically neutral,
significantly influencing ideological battles in Western democracies.
Conservatives, including Trump supporters, have accused social media platforms of
bias against their views.
Figures like Elon Musk, through initiatives like X (formerly Twitter), and Mark Zuckerberg
, by shifting Facebook’s policies,
have sought to address these concerns.
This ideological struggle extends beyond the U.S.,
as Musk’s involvement in European politics highlights a broader conflict between conservative and liberal ideologies.
The resulting polarisation has profound implications for democracies worldwide
, including India, where technology often intersects with political and societal narratives.
The Rise of Techno-Libertarianism
Leaders like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy
, alongside figures such as Peter Thiel,
represent a push to dismantle bureaucratic constraints
and accelerate innovation.
philosophy diverges from President Biden’s emphasis on safety, ethics, and accountability in AI
Instead,
Trump and his allies may prioritise unleashing the full potential of AI
and other technologies, even at the expense of regulatory oversight.
This shift could position the U.S. as a global leader in unregulated technological innovation,
creating opportunities and challenges for India.
India’s burgeoning tech ecosystem may benefit from collaboration, it must also navigate the ethical and security implications
of such policies.
Intensified Competition with China
A defining feature of Trump’s first term was the reorientation of U.S.-China relations
, emphasising technological competition.
Under Biden, this strategy evolved into extensive sanctions
, reshoring supply chains, and forging technological alliances.
Trump’s return is likely to intensify this competition
, with a focus on military AI development and Manhattan Project-style initiatives.
However, Trump’s penchant for bold, transactional diplomacy, exemplified by his pursuit of a grand bargain with Xi Jinping
, adds an element of unpredictability.
While structural contradictions between the U.S. and China may limit such deals,
the role of tech entrepreneurs with vested interests in China could influence policy.
The Way Forward for India: Look Beyond H-1B
Strengthening Diplomatic and Policy Engagement
India’s first step is to enhance diplomatic channels to ensure sustained dialogue with U.S.
includes advocating for the interests of its technology workforce and addressing concerns about illegal immigration
By demonstrating a commitment to orderly and merit-based immigration,
India can bolster its position as a valuable partner.
Engaging with key figures in the U.S. administration
, including policymakers with ties to the tech industry,
can help India influence the conversation around immigration reform and skilled workforce policies.
Deepening Bilateral Technological Collaboration
should prioritise expanding its bilateral collaboration with the U.S.
in strategic technology sectors.
By participating in initiatives like defence technology development,
AI research, and space exploration,
India can strengthen its position as a key partner.
This includes leveraging platforms such as the Quad and I2U2 (India, Israel, UAE, and the U.S.) for minilateral cooperation
, which can help India secure a role in shaping regional and global technological ecosystems.
Capitalising on ‘Friendshoring’ and Supply Chain Diversification
Trump’s emphasis on reshoring and ‘friendshoring’ supply chains presents India with an opportunity to position itself as a reliable alternative to China
in global manufacturing and technology supply chains.
India must focus on building the infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and economic incentives
necessary to attract American and multinational companies seeking to diversify their operations.
Special economic zones, tax benefits, and investment-friendly policies can make India a preferred destination
for tech manufacturing and innovation.
Balancing U.S.-China Competition
While aligning with U.S. technological and geopolitical priorities,
India must also maintain a calibrated approach to its relationship with China.
ongoing border tensions and trade disputes with China provide India with a strategic rationale for closer ties with the U.S.,
but it must avoid becoming overly dependent on American policy shifts.
Maintaining its strategic autonomy while leveraging U.S. partnerships will ensure that India’s interests remain safeguarded.
Conclusion
Donald Trump’s potential second term in office carries profound implications
for global technology policy and geopolitics.
While the H-1B visa issue remains important
, India must adopt a broader perspective, recognising the transformative potential of U.S. technology policies under Trump.
By aligning its strategic and technological priorities
India can secure its place as a key player in the evolving global order.

Fencing Incident in Malda's Kaliachak Block
The Central Road Works Department and BSF were constructing a single-row fence in Malda’s Kaliachak No. 3 block, near Bangladesh’s Shibganj in Rajshahi district.
Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) objected to the construction. These objections were addressed, and construction continued without further disruption.
Fencing Dispute in Mekhliganj, Cooch Behar
On January 10, villagers in Mekhliganj began fencing the boundary of the Bangladeshi enclave Dahagram-Angarpota, supported by the BSF.
The four-foot-high barbed-wire fence was intended to prevent cattle from Bangladesh from grazing on Indian crops.
BGB intervened to halt the fencing, raising tensions once again.
1975 Border Guidelines Between India and Bangladesh
1975 Joint India-Bangladesh Guidelines prohibit constructing defence structures within 150 yards of the international boundary
(zero line).
India does not classify wire fencing as defence structures, but Bangladesh and Pakistan do.
Challenges Due to Border Complexity
The border in West Bengal is marked by villages, rivers, and enclaves, complicating fencing construction.
Villages and houses often lie within the fencing line or directly on the international border.
For example, the Dahagram–Angarpota enclave in Jalpaiguri, a Bangladeshi territory within India, has fencing on the zero line.
Exceptions to the 150-Yard Rule
In cases where terrain, population, or water bodies make fencing at 150 yards impractical, construction near the border is negotiated with Bangladesh.
Villages located within 20 yards of the boundary are not relocated; instead, fencing is built close to the zero line.
Facilitation for Residents
Gates are installed along the fencing to ensure residents’ movement, with timings determined in consultation with villagers and local administration.
In emergencies, BSF soldiers have standing instructions to open gates immediately.
Negotiation and Approval for Fencing
The BSF informs the BGB when exceptions to the guidelines are necessary.
After mutual agreement, fencing construction begins in sensitive or challenging areas.
Violation of the 1975 Agreement
Bangladesh opposes fencing within 150 yards of the international border, citing the 1975 India-Bangladesh guidelines.
They argue that even
single-row fencing (SRF)
breaches this agreement.
Impact on Border Residents
Fencing causes inconvenience to residents living along the border, restricting their movement and activities.
Indian Perspective on SRF
SRF is intended to control animal movement and curb trans-border crimes, not as a defence structure.
Unlike concrete walls, bunkers, or ditch cum bandh (DCB), SRF has no defence potential.
Objection to Smart Fencing
Bangladesh objects to smart fencing, which includes CCTV and electronic surveillance, claiming it enables India to monitor their territory.
Smart fencing is primarily installed in areas where villages are within 150 yards of the border or on the boundary itself.
Issue of Trans-Border Crimes
Around 60% of trans-border crimes occur in areas without fencing, especially where villages are located on the international boundary.
India argues that fencing would help reduce such crimes, but Bangladesh remains unyielding.
Ongoing Discussions
The fencing issue has been under discussion for over five years, with frequent objections raised by BGB during flag meetings.

**********Draft Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal
Why in news?
Hamas has agreed to a draft ceasefire agreement in the Gaza conflict, with final approval pending from the Israeli Cabinet.
What’s in today’s article?
Background: Israel-Hamas Conflict
Three-Phase Ceasefire Plan Overview
Challenges to Ceasefire Implementation
Hamas suddenly attacked Israel
On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale attack on Israel, firing thousands of rockets and infiltrating Israeli territory.
The assault resulted in over 1,200 deaths, including civilians, and
the abduction of numerous hostages
Some 100 Israelis are still captive inside Gaza, and the military believes at least a third them are dead.
Offensive by Israel
In response, Israel initiated a massive military offensive in Gaza, targeting Hamas and its infrastructure.
The offensive caused widespread destruction and civilian casualties, with over 64,000 deaths reported in Gaza as per The Lancet.
Ceasefire attempts
The conflict drew global condemnation, highlighting humanitarian concerns.
The offensive has reduced large areas of the territory to rubble and displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million.
Hundreds of thousands are packed into tent camps along the coast where hunger is widespread.
Multiple ceasefire attempts followed, with negotiations involving the US, Egypt, and Qatar, but a long-term resolution remained elusive due to deep-rooted political tensions.
Basis:
The plan is based on a framework proposed by President Joe Biden in June 2024, though unresolved details and lack of guarantees for a sustained ceasefire present challenge.
Phase 1: Ceasefire and Hostage Exchange
A six-week ceasefire will commence, requiring a full Israeli military withdrawal from all populated areas in Gaza.
Hamas will release 33 Israeli hostages, including women, the elderly, and the wounded, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
All civilian captives — living or dead — will be released by the end of this phase.
Humanitarian aid will be sent into Gaza, with 600 trucks entering daily.
Palestinians will return to their homes, although widespread destruction poses challenges.
Phase 2: Further Hostage Release and Israeli Withdrawal
Hamas will release remaining captives, mainly male soldiers, in exchange for additional Palestinian prisoners.
Israel will execute a “complete withdrawal” of its forces from Gaza.
The ceasefire's continuation during this phase is not guaranteed, leaving room for potential resumption of military action.
Phase 3: Gaza Reconstruction
A large-scale reconstruction plan for Gaza will begin.
Any remains of deceased hostages will be returned to their families.
Hamas' Conditions
Hamas insists on a complete Israeli military withdrawal and an end to the war before releasing remaining hostages.
Recurring Obstacles in Past Ceasefires
Temporary ceasefire agreements were often made to allow humanitarian aid but failed due to:
Hamas' demand for Israel’s full withdrawal from Gaza, which Israel has consistently rejected.
Israel’s insistence on the destruction of Hamas as a condition for peace.
Internal Political Opposition in Israel
Far-right Israeli Ministers have threatened to quit the government over the deal, calling it a surrender to Hamas.
Maintaining a cohesive coalition in the war cabinet is difficult for Prime Minister Netanyahu, as it includes the Likud Party, far-right Jewish National Front, and ultra-Orthodox Jewish leaders.
Netanyahu's Political Position
The war and its aftermath have temporarily strengthened Netanyahu’s political career, despite prior dissatisfaction among Israelis.
A deal with Hamas could further strain his already fragile coalition.
