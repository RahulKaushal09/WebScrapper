LAWS GOVERNING IMPORT OF GOLD
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Context:
A Special Court of Economic Offences in Bengaluru rejected the bail plea of Kannada actor Ranya Rao, who was arrested for allegedly smuggling over 14 kilograms of gold on a flight from Dubai to Bengaluru.
Background: –
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) officials called it one of the biggest seizures of gold at Bengaluru airport in recent times.
Key takeaways
Until its repeal in 1990, the Gold (Control) Act, 1968, curbed gold imports and placed heavy restrictions on the acquisition, possession, and disposal of gold in India. However, with liberalisation in 1990s, the government modified its approach, imposing an import duty on gold.
Now, gold imports are largely governed under the Customs Act, 1962, and by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC).
The customs duty for gold may differ depending on the amount of gold carried by a passenger and the duration spent abroad before traveling back to India, as per the Baggage Rules, 2016 (issued under the Customs Act).
Under these rules, a man residing abroad for over a year may carry up to 20 grams of jewellery duty free (with a value cap of Rs 50,000) and a woman may similarly carry up to 40 grams (with a cap of Rs 1 lakh).
The CBIC also has specific guidelines for Indian passengers returning from Dubai after residing there for over six months, allowing them to carry up to 1 kg of gold as long as the applicable customs duty is paid.
In 2003, the Supreme Court held that any article imported without complying with the relevant conditions or restrictions must be considered a “prohibited good”. Such goods are liable to be confiscated under Section 111 and punished under Section 112 of the Customs Act.
The punishment may include a fine of up to the value of the goods. Section 135 provides a punishment of up to 7 years imprisonment if the market price of the smuggled goods exceeds Rs. 1 lakh.
Smuggling is also punishable under Section 111 (Organised Crime) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, which punishes “trafficking in illicit goods” with imprisonment of at least five years, extendable to life imprisonment.
The UAPA also carries the same punishment for smuggling as a “terrorist act” under Section 15 if it causes “damage to the monetary stability of India”.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF BONDS
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
The Sovereign Green Bonds (SGrBs) in India has received a luke response. The two new SGrBs worth Rs 10,000 crore auctioned in November and January faced muted response as bonds valued at Rs 7,443 crore remained unsold. This came despite a rule change allowing NRIs and foreign portfolio investors to participate without restrictions.
The government’s inability to raise adequate proceeds through bonds increases fiscal constraints.
A bond is an instrument to borrow money. A bond could be floated/issued by a country’s government or by a company to raise funds.
Since government bonds (referred to as G-secs in India, Treasury in the US, and Gilts in the UK) come with the sovereign’s guarantee, they are considered one of the safest investments. As a result, they also give the lowest returns on investment (or yield).
The yield of a bond is the effective rate of return that it earns. But the rate of return is not fixed — it changes with the price of the bond.
Sovereign green bonds (SGrBs) are those that are issued by sovereign entities, like the Government of India, which formulated a framework for issuing such bonds in 2022.
The framework defines “green projects” as those that encourage energy efficiency in resource utilisation, reduce carbon emissions, promote climate resilience, and improve natural ecosystems.
Masala Bonds
Masala Bonds are rupee-denominated bonds i.e. the funds would be raised from the overseas market in Indian rupees.
According to RBI, any corporate, body corporate, and Indian bank is eligible to issue rupee-denominated bonds overseas.
Advantages of Masala Bonds :
Lower Cost of Borrowing: Interest rates may be lower compared to domestic borrowing.
Diversification of Funding Sources: Enables Indian companies to access global capital markets.
Boosts Rupee Internationalization: Encourages wider acceptance of the Indian rupee in global finance.
Foreign Investors Bear Currency Risk: If the rupee depreciates, investors receive fewer dollars upon conversion, making it riskier for them.
Social Impact Bonds
Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) are innovative financial instruments designed to fund social programs through a results-based approach.
Unlike traditional bonds, SIBs do not provide fixed returns to investors. Instead, returns are linked to the achievement of predefined social outcomes (e.g., reducing unemployment, improving public health, or enhancing education).
How SIBs Work?
Government/Authority Identifies a Social Issue: A government or public sector entity defines a social problem that needs intervention.
Investors Provide Upfront Capital: Private investors or philanthropic organizations fund the project.
Service Providers Implement the Program: Non-profits or social enterprises execute interventions to achieve the desired impact.
Independent Evaluation: Third-party assessors measure the project’s success based on pre-agreed metrics.
Outcome-Based Repayment: If the project meets its goals, the government repays investors with a return. If the project fails, investors may lose part or all of their investment.
Key Features
Pay-for-Success Model: Government pays only if the intervention achieves measurable results.
Risk Transfer: Shifts financial risk from the public sector to private investors.
Encourages Innovation: Service providers have flexibility in implementing evidence-based solutions.
Examples of Social Impact Bonds : India’s Educate Girls Development Impact Bond (2015): Focused on improving girls’ education in Rajasthan.

CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS (CMES)
Prelims & Mains – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
Scientists from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) have reported observations of a flareless coronal mass ejection (CME) from the solar atmosphere with the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) instrument onboard Aditya-L1 mission.
The Aditya-L1 mission is India’s first scientific mission dedicated to studying the sun.
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are massive bursts of solar plasma and magnetic fields ejected from the Sun’s corona into space. They are often associated with solar flares and can have significant effects on Earth’s magnetosphere.
Causes of CMEs:
Intense magnetic field activity in the Sun’s corona.
Reconnection of magnetic field lines leading to explosive energy release.
Increased solar activity, particularly during solar maximum (the peak of the Sun’s 11-year solar cycle).
Impact of CMEs on Earth:
Geomagnetic Storms: When CMEs interact with Earth’s magnetosphere, they can cause geomagnetic storms, leading to disturbances in satellite communications and GPS signals.
Auroras: High-energy charged particles from CMEs interact with Earth’s atmosphere, creating bright auroras (Northern and Southern Lights).
Disruptions in Power Grids & Communication: Intense CMEs can induce electric currents in power grids, potentially causing large-scale blackouts.
Radio communications, especially HF (High Frequency) bands, can experience disruptions.
Satellite Damage: CMEs can increase the radiation exposure of satellites, leading to malfunctions or permanent damage.
Health Risks to Astronauts: Increased radiation exposure from CMEs poses health risks to astronauts in space.

**********Nagorno-Karabakh
Armenia and Azerbaijan have agreed to a peace agreement set to end nearly four decades of conflict between over disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.
About Nagorno-Karabakh:
Nagorno-Karabakh, referred to as
Artsakh
by Armenians, is a landlocked, mountainous region in the South Caucasus.
The general region includes the northeastern flank of the
Karabakh Range
of the Lesser Caucasus and extends from the crest line of the range to the margin of the
Kura Rive
r lowland at its foot.
Nagorno-Karabakh’s environments vary from
steppe
on the Kura lowland through
dense forest
of oak, hornbeam, and
beech
on the lower mountain slopes to birchwood and alpine meadows higher up.
Following the
Russian Empire's collapse
in 1917, both Armenia and Azerbaijan asserted claims over this area, leading to enduring tensions.
Internationally recognized as
part of Azerbaijan
, until recently much of it was governed by the unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, also known as the Republic of Artsakh.
Historically, the region's population was predominantly ethnic Armenian, and it operated a self-established government closely aligned with Armenia, though lacking official recognition from Armenia or other United Nations member states.
Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict Timeline:
The conflict has roots dating back well over a century into competition between Christian Armenian and Muslim Turkic and Persian influences.
1920s:
After World War I and the Bolshevik revolution, Soviet rulers created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region within Azerbaijan, with an ethnic Armenian majority.
1991:
As the Soviet Union collapsed, Karabakh declared independence, and tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis led to full-scale war.
1992-94:
The First Karabakh War resulted in up to 30,000 deaths. Armenians took control of the region and occupied surrounding Azerbaijani land, creating a buffer zone.
2017:
A referendum in Karabakh changed the government to a fully presidential system and renamed the region from Nagorno-Karabakh Republic to Republic of Artsakh.
2020:
The Second Karabakh War saw Azerbaijan reclaiming territory around Karabakh, with 3,000 Azerbaijani and 4,000 Armenian soldiers killed in six weeks of fighting.
2022:
Clashes broke out between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces, with 100 Armenian and 70 Azerbaijani soldiers killed.
2024:
Nagorno-Karabakh was officially dissolved.

**********Supersolid
In an exciting scientific breakthrough, researchers have successfully turned light into a "supersolid" for the first time ever.
About Supersolid:
Supersolids are a strange state of matter defined by
quantum mechanics
where particles condense into an orderly, crystalline solid but also move like a liquid that has
no viscosity
Usually, solids don't move on their own, but supersolids change direction and density depending on particle interactions while maintaining an organized lattice structure.
Why Are Supersolids So Cold?
Supersolids require
extremely low temperatures to form
— usually very close to absolute zero (minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 273.15 degrees Celsius).
Most of the particles have to occupy the
lowest energy state available
, and heat makes particles jump up and down like excitable toddlers in a ball pit.
If a material is cold enough, the temperature no longer obscures how the particles interact with each other. Instead, the tiny effects of quantum mechanics become the defining factors in how the material behaves.
Significance of the Discovery:
Supersolids have traditionally been observed in
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)
of ultracold atoms near absolute zero.
However, this new development expands the scope by
coupling light and matter
, enabling researchers to study condensed-matter physics
under extreme quantum conditions
The discovery has profound implications for quantum computing, where supersolid-based systems could enhance
qubit stability
It also opens pathways for advancements in optical circuits, photonic devices, and fundamental physics research.

**********ISRO Successfully Undocks SpaDeX Satellites, Strengthening India’s Space Capabilities
Why in the News?
Nearly two months after the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully demonstrated its docking capability, it disengaged and undocked two satellites.
What’s in Today’s Article?
SpaDeX Mission (Introduction, Key Features, Significance, Road Ahead, etc.)
Introduction:
ISRO successfully undocked the
SpaDeX (Space Docking Experiment)
satellites SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target) after nearly two months of testing their docking capabilities.
The manoeuvre marks India’s significant progress in autonomous docking and undocking technology.
This accomplishment positions India as the fourth country after the United States, Russia, and China to develop this advanced space docking capability.
The achievement is critical for future ISRO missions, including human spaceflight, lunar exploration, and the construction of India’s planned space station.
About the SpaDeX Mission:
SpaDeX is an ambitious ISRO mission designed to test India's ability to autonomously dock and undock satellites in orbit. The experiment involved:
Docking:
Two 220-kg satellites, SDX01 and SDX02, were maneuvered into the same orbit and progressively brought closer until they were joined on January 16, 2025.
Power Sharing:
The mission demonstrated power-sharing capabilities, where both satellites operated as a single composite unit.
Undocking:
On March 14, the capture levers were released, and the satellites were commanded to separate, successfully completing the undocking operation.
ISRO officials took their time before executing the undocking manoeuvre to ensure every step was thoroughly analysed, as this was the agency’s first attempt at such a mission.
Significance of this Capability:
Chandrayaan-4 and Lunar Sample Return Missions
ISRO plans to launch
, a mission aimed at bringing back lunar surface samples. This will require two critical docking operations:
In Lunar Orbit:
The ascender module carrying Moon samples will dock with a transfer module.
In Earth Orbit:
The transfer module will dock with a re-entry module, which will carry the samples back to Earth.
The Bharatiya Antariksha Station (India’s Own Space Station)
India is working on launching its own space station, the
, by 2035.
This will consist of five separate modules that must be docked together in space to form the complete station.
Human Spaceflight and Resupply Missions
In future human spaceflight missions, docking and undocking will be crucial for sending astronauts to space stations and facilitating cargo transport, similar to how the International Space Station (ISS) functions.
ISRO’s Indigenous Docking System: A Major Innovation
One of the highlights of the SpaDeX mission is the development of
Bharatiya Docking System
, which is:
Inspired by International Standards
: Similar to the International Docking System Standard used by spacecraft docking with the ISS.
Designed with Simplicity
: While the ISS docking system has 24 motors, ISRO’s system operates efficiently with just two motors.
Androgynous Design
: Both the Chaser and Target satellites have identical docking systems, making the process seamless.
This indigenous innovation strengthens India’s self-reliance in space technologies and paves the way for future deep-space missions.
The Road Ahead: Further Refinements and More Experiments
ISRO officials stated that they might conduct further docking and undocking experiments to refine the system’s accuracy.
Exhaustive ground simulations and analysis
were key to achieving this milestone in the first attempt itself.
The organization is now focused on integrating docking systems into upcoming missions, including the
Gaganyaan human spaceflight program
future lunar missions
satellite servicing projects
Conclusion:
The successful undocking of the SpaDeX satellites is a major milestone for ISRO, showcasing its growing expertise in space docking technology.  This capability is essential for future lunar exploration, space station assembly, and human spaceflight missions.
As ISRO continues its research and experimentation, SpaDeX lays the groundwork for a future where India can independently conduct complex space missions, marking a giant leap toward self-sufficiency in space exploration.

**********A School Closure That Must be Called Out
Context
The
decision to close the only Gondi-medium school in a village
in Maharashtra raises crucial questions about the preservation of linguistic and cultural rights
, the power dynamics embedded in education policies, and the broader socio-political neglect of Adivasi communities.
While the
official justification for the closure is based on procedural concerns,
a deeper analysis reveals a historical and systemic bias against tribal languages and cultures.
Therefore,
it is important to critically examine the implications of the closure within constitutional,
socio-political, and cultural contexts.
The Constitutional and Legal Framework
establishment of the Gondi-medium school in Mohgaon village
was a
progressive step towards ensuring that tribal students receive primary education
in their mother tongue.
initiative aligned with Article 29 of the Indian Constitution
, which guarantees minorities the right to preserve their distinct languages, scripts, and cultures.
Additionally,
Article 350(a) mandates the state to make provisions for children from linguistic minorities
to receive education in their mother tongue.
These
constitutional safeguards acknowledge the importance of linguistic diversity
in India’s pluralistic democracy.
However,
the closure of the school has been justified on the grounds
that it is not registered under the
Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.
administration argues that non-recognition could lead to challenges in monitoring educational standards
and might jeopardize students' future academic prospects.
While these procedural concerns are valid,
they should not override the constitutional commitment to minority linguistic rights.
government's refusal to formally recognise the school suggests a deeper issue of power
and systemic bias rather than a mere legal technicality.
The Politics of Recognition and Subordination
non-recognition of the school reflects a broader structural and socio-political subordination
state’s normative bias against tribal languages and cultures is evident in its refusal
to acknowledge Gondi as a medium of education.
This
bureaucratic resistance must be understood in the context of historical oppression
and marginalisation of Adivasi communities.
Jawaharlal Nehru believed that tribal communities should be allowed to develop according to their own traditions
and knowledge systems.
This vision was
shaped by the historical reality
that colonial policies had devastated many indigenous communities worldwide.
In response,
the Indian Constitution incorporated special provisions to protect tribal rights
, including land ownership, cultural preservation, and linguistic diversity.
despite these constitutional safeguards, tribal communities continue to face systemic marginalisation
, particularly in education and language policies.
The Issue of Forces of Absorption and Linguistic Suppression
Since Independence
, Adivasi communities have been subjected to forces of absorption
, both secular and religious, that have eroded their cultural identities.
secular forces of absorption operate through the state and market mechanisms
, while religious forces work through the denigration and erasure of tribal belief systems.
closure of the Gondi-medium school represents a form of state-led absorption
, where the lack of official recognition undermines the legitimacy of tribal education systems.
One of the most striking examples of this linguistic neglect is the
exclusion of major tribal languages like Gondi and Bhili from the Eighth Schedule
of the Constitution, which recognizes 22 languages.
According to the 2011 Census,
Gondi is spoken by over 2.9 million people across six states,
yet it remains unrecognised at the national level.
In contrast, Sanskrit, spoken by fewer than 25,000 people, enjoys state recognition
and institutional support.
disparity highlights the socio-political power imbalance in language recognition,
where dominant cultural groups shape policies to their advantage, while marginalised communities struggle for basic linguistic rights.
The Urgency of Preserving Adivasi Languages
The Oral Nature of Adivasi Languages and the Threat of Extinction
Unlike many dominant languages that have a well-established written tradition,
Adivasi languages primarily exist in oral form.
Their knowledge systems, folk tales
, myths, songs, religious practices, and historical narratives,
are passed down verbally from generation to generation.
oral tradition makes Adivasi languages highly vulnerable to extinction
, as they rely on active usage rather than written records for survival.
As younger generations shift to dominant regional or national languages due to educational and economic pressures,
there is a risk that traditional knowledge embedded in Adivasi languages will be lost forever.
Once a language disappears,
an entire worldview, along with its unique ways of understanding nature,
medicine, governance, and spirituality, vanishes with it.
This loss is irreversible, making the need for preservation urgent.
The Impact of Modernisation and Globalisation
forces of modernisation, urbanisation, and market-driven economies
have significantly
accelerated the decline of Adivasi languages.
As tribal communities integrate into mainstream society,
the pressure to adopt dominant languages such as Hindi, Marathi, or English increases.
Schools, government institutions, and employment sectors predominantly operate in these languages, making fluency in them a necessity for economic survival.
This linguistic shift creates a generational divide
where younger members of the community lose proficiency in their native tongue, while elders remain its last custodians.
Over time,
as the elder speakers pass away, the language is pushed to the brink of extinction.
Without active efforts to promote and teach Adivasi languages within formal education and daily life, they will continue to fade, erasing an integral part of India’s cultural diversity.
Exclusion from Institutional Recognition and Support
The neglect of Adivasi languages is institutionalised in India’s language policies.
Constitution recognises 22 languages in the Eighth Schedule,
major tribal languages like Gondi and Bhili are absent.
This exclusion has following consequences:
Lack of Educational Support
Schools do not offer instruction in Adivasi languages
, forcing tribal children to study in unfamiliar languages.
creates a learning barrier,
leading to poor academic performance and high dropout rates.
Limited Literary and Media Presence
Without official recognition
, there is little incentive to develop books, newspapers, digital content, or broadcasts in Adivasi languages
, restricting their reach and development.
Government Apathy in Language Preservation
absence of state support means there are no significant efforts to document, standardise, or promote these languages,
leaving their survival entirely dependent on community efforts.
failure to acknowledge and promote Adivasi languages reflects deeper inequalities
Conclusion
The preservation of Adivasi languages is
a race against time; each passing generation witnesses a decline in the number of fluent speakers
, and with them, invaluable cultural knowledge disappears.
The state’s failure to recognise and promote these languages reflects broader issues of neglect
and marginalization.
However, w
ith proactive measures, ranging from constitutional recognition to community-driven initiatives,
it is possible to reverse this trend.
Recognising and promoting these languages would not only uphold constitutional values
but also ensure that India remains a truly pluralistic society that respects and nurtures all its cultures.

**********The Gender Budget, Bigger Allocations, Little Impact
Context
Union Budget 2025-26 has been widely acknowledged for its increased allocation towards women-centric schemes
, with the gender budget rising to ₹4.49 lakh crore, a significant 37.25% increase from the previous fiscal year.
However,
despite the substantial rise in allocations, the benefits have not been equally distributed,
particularly among marginalized women from Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities.
Therefore, there is the need to
critically evaluate the gender budget’s effectiveness, highlighting its key shortcomings,
structural barriers, and potential solutions to improve its impact.
Primary Concern Surrounding the Gender Budget: Rising Allocations, Limited Outcomes
Over the years,
the gender budget has grown consistently
, reflecting the government’s intent to bridge gender disparities.
economic benefits have not reached women in proportion to these allocations,
especially among marginalised groups.
government has introduced targeted schemes such as the PM Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) and the Dharti Aba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan
, yet their actual impact remains limited.
These schemes have struggled to
address the deep-rooted socio-economic disadvantages
faced by SC/ST women.
One major issue is the lack of an intersectional approach in gender budgeting.
Despite India having a
for two decades, it has
failed to incorporate learnings from previous budgets
or consider factors such as caste, class, and tribal identity.
Without addressing these intersections, welfare programs remain ineffective in transforming the lives of marginalized women.
Structural Barriers and Implementation Challenges
Digital Exclusion
Several structural barriers hinder the
effective implementation
of gender-focused schemes. One such challenge is digital exclusion.
While digitisation aims to eliminate intermediaries,
many women, particularly in rural and tribal areas, lack digital literacy
, preventing them from accessing welfare benefits independently.
Without investment in digital literacy programs,
the government's push for digitized welfare delivery may inadvertently create new barriers
rather than eliminating old ones.
Outdated Census Data
Another significant challenge is the
outdated Census data.
last Census in India was conducted in 2011, meaning current policy decisions are based on data
that is over a decade old.
This
gap in updated statistics weakens accountability mechanisms
and makes it difficult to assess whether funds are reaching those who need them most.
For instance,
the Ministry of Tribal Affairs saw a 45.79% budget increase, yet there is no gender-disaggregated data
available to evaluate how these funds benefit SC/ST women specifically.
Bureaucratic Inefficiencies
Bureaucratic inefficiencies further limit the effectiveness of gender-focused allocations.
The ‘
Dalit Adivasi Budget Analysis 2023-24’ report
found that over 35% of funds allocated under the SC and ST Sub-Plans remain underutilised due to complex procedures, lack of community involvement, and poor outreach.
Many women struggle to navigate financial and bureaucratic jargon,
making it harder for them to benefit from government initiatives.
Key Areas for Reform
Adopting an Intersectional Approach
Gender budgets
must be designed with an understanding of how caste, class, and tribal identities influence
access to resources.
comprehensive audit should be conducted at both central and state levels
to ensure budget allocations address these factors effectively.
Strengthening Local Governance and Panchayati Raj Institutions
Panchayati Raj institutions
play a crucial role in delivering services at the grassroots level,
yet they often lack autonomy and resources.
Strengthening these institutions, providing adequate funding
, and preventing the dominance of ‘sarpanch husbands’ (male relatives of elected female leaders who control decision-making) are necessary steps for ensuring that schemes benefit women directly.
Community-Led Participatory Planning
Involving women,
particularly those from SC/ST backgrounds, in the planning and monitoring of welfare schemes can improve their effectiveness.
Kudumbashree model
Kerala demonstrates how community-led initiatives can enhance outreach and implementation.
Similar models should be adopted nationwide.
Improving Data Collection and Transparency
The government must
ensure regular updates to gender-disaggregated data
to track the actual impact of policies.
Establishing a
gender budget tracking
portal could enhance public accountability and provide real-time insights into fund utilisation.
Investing in Digital Literacy
Given the government's reliance on digitisation,
investment in digital literacy programs is crucial to enable women,
particularly in rural and marginalized communities, to access welfare benefits independently.
Conclusion
While the increased allocation in the Union Budget 2025-26 signals a step in the right direction,
real progress depends on effective implementation.
Addressing structural barriers
such as digital exclusion, bureaucratic inefficiencies
, and outdated data is crucial.
More importantly
, policies must move beyond token allocations to ensure that marginalized women, particularly those from SC/ST communities
, receive tangible benefits.
By adopting an intersectional approach
, strengthening local governance, and improving accountability mechanisms,
the gender budget can become a transformative tool for women's empowerment
rather than a symbolic gesture.

**********How US Farm Subsidies Impact Washington-Delhi Trade Negotiations
Why in news?
In 2023, the US had only 1.82 million family farms, far fewer than India’s 93.09 million agricultural households (2019 data). Despite their smaller numbers, US farmers, with a median household income of $97,984 (higher than the national median), receive substantial government support.
This is a key issue in US-India trade negotiations, as Washington pushes for greater market access for American agricultural products, arguing that India’s farm sector must open up.
What’s in today’s article?
Form of Assistance in the US
Magnitude of Assistance
Lessons for India
Unlike India, the US does not subsidize farm inputs like fertilizer, electricity, or water, nor does it intervene through large-scale procurement and stocking.
Instead, government support is primarily provided through direct payments to farmers.
Key Financial Assistance Programs
Price Loss Coverage (PLC)
Farmers receive payments when the market price of a covered crop falls below the
Effective Reference Price (ERP)
, similar to India’s Minimum Support Price (MSP).
Unlike India’s MSP, which requires government procurement, US farmers are compensated directly for the price difference.
Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC)
This provides financial assistance when actual revenue from a crop falls below a guaranteed level based on county-specific yields and a five-year price average.
Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC)
This program offers financial aid when the margin between farmgate milk prices and feed costs drops below a set threshold, ensuring stable farmer incomes.
These mechanisms help US farmers manage price fluctuations and revenue shortfalls, providing a more predictable income without direct market interventions.
The US farm sector receives substantial direct payments from the government, ranging from
$9.3 billion to $45.6 billion
in recent years.
These payments help farmers manage risks and income fluctuations.
Key Financial Assistance Figures
Peak Assistance in 2020
– Farmers received
billion, including
$31.4
billion in pandemic and disaster relief, making up
38% of their net cash income
Projected Payments for 2025
– Estimated at $42.4 billion, largely driven by disaster assistance under the American Relief Act of 2025.
Total Aid (2019-2023)
– The US Government Accountability Office reported that
$161 billion
was disbursed through 27 programs, with major allocations:
Crop insurance: $53.6 billion
COVID-19 aid: $30.9 billion
Trade relief: $22.6 billion
PLC/ARC/DMC payments: $16.8 billion
Environmental conservation: $16.2 billion
India provides substantial support to its farmers through multiple subsidy programs, but the distribution and impact differ significantly from the US model.
Scale of Agricultural Support
Total Annual Assistance – Estimated at ₹5 lakh crore ($57.5 billion), covering:
PM-Kisan: ₹63,500 crore (₹6,000 per farmer annually)
Fertilizer subsidy: ₹1,71,300 crore
Crop loan subsidy: ₹22,600 crore
Crop insurance subsidy: ₹15,864 crore
MSP procurement and state-level subsidies
Comparison with US Assistance
India’s support is spread across
111 million farmers
, while the US aids just
1.04 million
Average annual federal payment:
India (PM-Kisan):
₹6,000 ($69) per farmer
US:
₹26.8 lakh ($30,782) per producer
Unequal Competition in Trade Negotiations
US farmers, despite fewer in number, receive far greater direct financial assistance.
Opening India’s agricultural market to US produce could lead to unfair competition due to the disparity in government support.
World Trade Organization (WTO) rules allow “special and differential treatment” for developing nations, ensuring they are not forced into reciprocal trade concessions.
Key Question for US-India Trade Talks
Whether the US will respect this WTO principle of non-reciprocity—allowing India to safeguard its farmers without equivalent market access for American produce—remains uncertain.

**********Challenges and Complexities of Federalism in India
Context:
Federalism in India is facing
multiple challenges,
both minor and major, which require careful political negotiation.
Issues such as delimitation, state representation, language disputes, and financial allocations have sparked
tensions between the Centre and states
Additionally,
structural issues
like power distribution, administrative imbalances, and political dominance are impacting the
federal structure
Key Challenges in Indian Federalism:
Regional representation and delimitation:
The issue of delimitation and balancing representation between North and South India remains a contentious topic.
Jammu and Kashmir
still awaits the restoration of full statehood.
Centre-State conflicts:
Tamil Nadu vs. Centre:
Disputes over language and education policies.
Tamil Nadu accuses the Centre of withholding
Samagra Shiksha funds and attempting to impose Hindi.
The Centre counters that Tamil Nadu is politicizing the National Education Policy (
NEP
).
States continue to express dissatisfaction over the Centre’s growing control over subjects like
health and education
, originally part of
the State List
Horizontal and vertical imbalances:
There is an increasing gap in development across states, creating horizontal imbalances.
The division of power
between the Union, State, and Concurrent Lists needs reconsideration.
Centralization of authority
has been co-produced by both the Centre and states due to
failures in governance
Political and administrative federalism:
The dominance of political parties affects the autonomy of states.
The anti-defection law
has weakened legislative oversight, with political party structures superseding federal considerations.
National parties, while unifying different regions, sometimes override federal demands.
Financial federalism and GST:
The Goods and Services Tax
(GST) framework
is a unique model where states collectively make binding decisions.
There is potential for extending such collective decision-making models to other domains, ensuring fair financial governance across states.
Inter-State cooperation:
Current discussions on federalism often focus on
Centre-State relations rather than State-to-State cooperation.
Issues like airshed management and water disputes require states to
collaborate independently
without Centre or judicial intervention.
The role of political parties
further complicates independent state-level decision-making.
Conclusion
Federalism in India remains a "
messy affair
" influenced by political, economic, and administrative complexities.
While historically federalism has evolved through trial and error, modern challenges necessitate
innovative solutions
The distinction between party politics and federal governance
needs to be
re-evaluated to ensure the autonomy and equitable development of all states.

(2023)
Mentor’s Comment:
This question focused on India’s strategic positioning and alliances with the West, relates to the broader context of
high-level summit diplomacy and strategic interactions between nations
A strong leader is often seen as someone who holds significant power, shaping both government policies and their political party. This leadership style is debated, but many agree it can be useful in politics and diplomacy. Leaders like Donald Trump and Narendra Modi are considered strong leaders. Both actively engage in summit diplomacy, which has both advantages and risks. While decisive leadership can bring benefits, relying too much on personal judgment can lead to problems. Despite these challenges,
has become a key tool for powerful leaders in handling major global issues like war and peace.
Today’s editorial highlights the importance of summit diplomacy and the key traits of a strong leader. This topic is useful for
GS Paper 2
in the
UPSC Mains exam.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Despite unplanned meetings like Trump’s, summit diplomacy will remain important in global relations.
What are the key characteristics of a “strong leader” in the context of modern politics and diplomacy?
Centralization of Power:
A strong leader often consolidates power, making key policy and political decisions with minimal consultation.
Example:
Vladimir Putin’s centralized control over Russian politics and military decisions.
Assertive Foreign Policy and Summit Diplomacy:
They engage directly in high-profile diplomatic negotiations, often prioritizing personal rapport over traditional diplomatic channels.
Donald Trump’s direct summits with Kim Jong-un to negotiate North Korea’s nuclear program.
Image Building and Popular Appeal:
They craft a strong public persona through rhetoric, social media, and large-scale events to project authority and national pride.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s use of mass rallies and media control to consolidate power in Turkey.
Decisive but Controversial Decision-Making:
They make bold decisions, sometimes bypassing institutional checks, which can lead to both positive reforms and authoritarian tendencies.
Xi Jinping’s removal of term limits in China, allowing him to rule indefinitely.
Why is summit diplomacy considered both beneficial and problematic in resolving international conflicts?
Benefits of summit diplomacy:
Direct and Efficient Decision-Making:
Summits allow leaders to bypass bureaucratic delays and make high-stakes decisions quickly.
Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)
saw U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev negotiate directly, preventing nuclear war.
Confidence-Building and Diplomatic Trust:
Face-to-face interactions help build mutual trust and diplomatic relationships between nations.
Reagan-Gorbachev Summits (1985-1988)
played a key role in reducing Cold War tensions and leading to nuclear arms reduction.
Breakthroughs in Long-Standing Disputes:
Summit diplomacy has resolved historical disputes that traditional diplomacy failed to address.
Camp David Accords (1978)
led to peace between Egypt and Israel after decades of hostility.
Symbolic and Strategic Value:
High-profile summits reinforce a country’s global leadership and strategic partnerships.
Singapore Summit (2018)
between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, which temporarily reduced tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
Crisis Management and De-escalation:
Summits provide a platform for crisis diplomacy, helping to prevent conflicts from escalating into full-scale wars.
Dayton Accords (1995)
ended the Bosnian War by bringing together leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia for direct negotiations.
Problems of
Risk of Superficial Agreements:
Leaders often prioritize political optics over substantive solutions, leading to vague or unenforceable agreements.
Minsk Agreements (2014-2015)
aimed at resolving the Ukraine conflict but lacked effective implementation mechanisms.
Personal Egos and Power Imbalances:
Strong-willed leaders may focus more on personal victories rather than genuine conflict resolution.
Trump-Zelenskyy Summit (2025)
, where public confrontations and political grandstanding overshadowed meaningful negotiations on Ukraine.
How did the Trump-Zelenskyy exchanges highlight the complexities and risks of pseudo-summit diplomacy?
Blurred Lines Between Diplomacy and Personal Interests:
Instead of focusing purely on state interests, pseudo-summit diplomacy can be influenced by personal or political gains.
Trump-Zelenskyy phone call (2019)
became controversial when Trump allegedly pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden’s son, intertwining diplomacy with U.S. domestic politics.
Lack of Institutional Safeguards:
Informal or direct leader-to-leader diplomacy can bypass traditional diplomatic channels, reducing oversight and accountability.
The absence of career diplomats in the Trump-Zelenskyy exchanges led to concerns over improper diplomatic conduct and potential abuse of power.
Vulnerability to Misinformation and Manipulation:
Without structured diplomatic engagement, such interactions can be misused for propaganda or misinterpreted in ways that escalate tensions.
impeachment inquiry against Trump
was fueled by the whistleblower complaint alleging that the U.S. was leveraging military aid for political favors.
What should India learn from this? (Way forward)
Institutionalize Diplomatic Processes:
Informal leader-to-leader diplomacy should not replace structured diplomatic engagement involving foreign service professionals.
India should prioritize institutional mechanisms (e.g., MEA-led negotiations) to ensure consistency and avoid undue political influence in international relations.
Avoid Mixing Domestic Politics with Foreign Policy:
Diplomatic engagements must remain separate from electoral or partisan interests to maintain credibility.
India must ensure that foreign policy decisions are not dictated by short-term political gains and avoid using international diplomacy for domestic political narratives.
Strengthen Transparency and Accountability:
Diplomatic engagements should be conducted with oversight to prevent misuse or misinterpretation.
India should continue using parliamentary committees and professional diplomats to maintain transparency and avoid secretive deals that could lead to unintended consequences.
**********A voluntary mandate: On the APAAR student ID
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Data protection; impact of APAAR;
Why in the News?
The Ministry of Education introduced the
Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) ID
digitally store each student’s academic records,
providing a single, reliable source of their educational history throughout their life in India.
Should the APAAR ID be imposed without a legal framework in place?
Violation of Right to Privacy:
Without a legal framework, imposing APAAR violates the
right to privacy
upheld by the Supreme Court in the
Puttaswamy judgment (2017)
Example:
The Court ruled that
Aadhaar
cannot be mandatory for basic services like school admissions. APAAR, linked to Aadhaar, may similarly infringe on privacy rights.
Lack of Informed Consent:
Mandatory implementation without clear legal guidelines undermines
voluntary participation
informed consent
Parents in
Uttar Pradesh
Karnataka
face pressure to enroll their children despite official claims that APAAR is voluntary.
Data Security Risks:
Collecting sensitive student data without legal safeguards increases
vulnerability to data breaches
and misuse.
Aadhaar leak incidents
exposed millions of personal records, highlighting risks in handling large-scale digital databases without strict protection laws.
Discrimination and Exclusion:
Errors in digital records (e.g., name mismatches) can
exclude
students from educational benefits if no legal recourse is available.
DigiLocker
, discrepancies in Aadhaar details have led to failed registrations and denial of services. Similar risks exist with APAAR.
Need for Legislative Oversight:
A legal framework ensures
transparency
accountability
, and
public trust
in the system’s operation.
Countries like
Germany
regulate educational data under the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
to protect citizens’ privacy. India lacks similar comprehensive safeguards for APAAR.
What is the purpose of the APAAR ID introduced by the Ministry of Education?
Digitisation of Academic Records:
APAAR (Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry) aims to create a
digital repository
for every student’s academic transcripts, ensuring a
lifetime record
of their educational journey.
It seeks to provide a
unified and verified database
for academic credentials, reducing discrepancies and ensuring
authenticity
across institutions.
Improved Accessibility and Portability:
Enables students to
access, share, and transfer
their academic records seamlessly across educational institutions and employment platforms.
Integration with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI):
APAAR is part of the broader
strategy, aligning with initiatives like
UDISE+
and the
Student Database Management System
to enhance educational governance.
Facilitating Future Opportunities:
It aims to streamline processes like
scholarship applications
higher education admissions
employment verification
, making these services more
efficient and transparent
How are schools and state education authorities in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka enforcing APAAR enrolment?
Imposing 100% Enrolment Targets:
Schools have been directed to achieve
“saturation”
, meaning
complete APAAR enrolment
for all students, putting pressure on administrators and parents.
, education authorities have set
strict deadlines
for schools to register every student under the APAAR system.
Threatening Consequences for Non-Enrolment:
Schools are
warning parents
of potential penalties or loss of educational services if they refuse to enroll their children.
, some schools have informed parents that
students may face issues
in accessing government benefits and future educational opportunities without APAAR registration.
Targeting Minority Institutions and Administrators: Religious minority schools
and district education officials face
increased scrutiny
for discrepancies between APAAR and existing student records.
, authorities have questioned
minority institutions
over mismatched enrollment data, raising concerns about
discrimination
administrative overreach
Way forward:
Enact a Clear Legal Framework:
Introduce
legislation
to regulate APAAR, ensuring

**********A school closure that must be called out
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to Adivasi communities;
Why in the News?
The shutdown of the only Gondi-medium school in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district, which was started in 2019 by the Mohgaon gram panchayat, raises concerns about tribal students learning in their own language.
What constitutional provisions support the preservation of Adivasi languages and cultures in India?
Article 29
: Protects the rights of minorities to conserve their distinct languages, scripts, and cultures.
Article 350A
: Directs the state to provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother tongue at the primary education level for minority children.
Fifth Schedule
: Provides special protections and governance provisions for Scheduled Areas, where many Adivasi communities reside.
Sixth Schedule
: Grants autonomy to certain tribal areas in the northeastern states, allowing self-governance and cultural preservation.
Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA)
: Recognizes the role of gram sabhas in self-governance, including decisions related to education in tribal areas.
How do the forces of absorption in secular and religious realms impact Adivasi communities?
Marginalization of Adivasi Languages in Education:
Adivasi students are forced to learn in dominant languages, leading to the decline of their mother tongues and weakening of cultural identity.
Example
: The closure of the Gondi-medium school in Maharashtra due to non-recognition under the Right to Education Act.
Loss of Land and Displacement Due to Development Projects:
Adivasi communities are displaced from their ancestral lands due to industrial and infrastructural projects, leading to economic instability and cultural loss.
: Large-scale mining and dam projects in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have forced many Adivasis to migrate to urban slums.
Religious Assimilation and Erosion of Indigenous Beliefs:
Traditional tribal religious practices are undermined or replaced by dominant religions, leading to cultural homogenization.
: The decline of Sarna worship among Adivasis due to conversions to Hinduism and Christianity.
Market-Driven Cultural Appropriation:
Tribal art, music, and traditions are exploited for commercial purposes without benefiting the Adivasi creators.
: Warli and Gond paintings being sold globally, while many Adivasi artists remain in poverty.
Denial of Political and Constitutional Recognition:
The lack of official recognition for Adivasi languages and cultures weakens their identity and limits access to resources and opportunities.
: Gondi, spoken by over 2.9 million people, is not included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution, whereas Sanskrit, spoken by fewer than 25,000, is recognized.
What are the steps taken by the government?
National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:
Emphasizes mother-tongue-based education at the primary level, promoting indigenous languages.
Example:
Bilingual textbooks in tribal languages have been introduced in states like Odisha and Jharkhand.
Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS):
Aims to provide quality education to tribal students while incorporating their cultural heritage.
Over 700 EMRS schools are planned across India, with some offering instruction in tribal languages.
Documentation and Digital Preservation Initiatives:
Projects to document and preserve endangered tribal languages and cultures.
The Scheme for Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages (SPPEL) under the CIIL (Central Institute of Indian Languages) focuses on documenting languages like Gondi.
What are the factors that highlight the contrast between the recognition of Sanskrit and Gondi in the Eighth Schedule?
Oral vs. Textual Tradition:
Sanskrit has a vast corpus of classical texts and scriptures, whereas Gondi follows an oral tradition, making it vulnerable to erosion without formal preservation efforts.
: Ancient Sanskrit texts like the Vedas are archived and studied, but Gondi folklore and oral histories are at risk of being lost due to a lack of institutional documentation.
Number of Speakers:
Gondi is spoken by over 2.9 million people across six states, while Sanskrit has fewer than 25,000 speakers.
: Despite its widespread use among Adivasi communities, Gondi remains unrecognized, whereas Sanskrit, with a much smaller speaker base, is included in the Eighth Schedule.
State Support and Promotion:
Sanskrit receives government funding, university courses, and institutional backing, whereas Gondi lacks state-supported educational and literary initiatives.
: Sanskrit is taught in schools and has dedicated institutions like the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, while Gondi-medium schools struggle for recognition, such as the case in Maharashtra.
Socio-Political Influence:
Sanskrit is associated with elite Brahminical traditions and enjoys support from powerful socio-political groups, whereas Gondi is linked to marginalized Adivasi communities with limited political representation.
: Political leaders and policymakers advocate for Sanskrit’s preservation, but there is little lobbying for Gondi’s inclusion in the Eighth Schedule.
Economic and Employment Relevance:
Sanskrit is promoted as a classical and sacred language, but it has minimal practical usage in employment, whereas Gondi is actively spoken by tribal communities in daily life.
: Sanskrit is used in religious and academic contexts, while Gondi is the primary language for communication among Adivasis, yet lacks state recognition.
Way forward:
Institutional Recognition and Policy Support:
Need to include Gondi and other major Adivasi languages in the Eighth Schedule to ensure constitutional recognition, funding for education, and cultural preservation.
Community-Led Preservation and Promotion:
The Government should strengthen grassroots efforts by empowering Adivasi organizations, establishing indigenous language schools, and promoting digital documentation of oral traditions.
Mains PYQ:
Given the diversities among tribal communities in India, in which specific contexts should they be considered as a single category?
(UPSC IAS/2022)
Reason-
This question is relevant because the closure of the Gondi-medium school highlights the specific educational needs of a particular tribal community (Gondi speakers).
