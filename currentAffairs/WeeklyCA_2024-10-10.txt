in northern Sri Lanka and initiated development projects at
Kankesanthurai and Trincomalee ports.
Economic Cooperation:
India and Sri Lanka have strengthened economic ties through the
India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA)
, with India being Sri Lanka's
third-largest expor
t destination and
over 60%
of exports benefiting from the agreement.
They are also exploring an
Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA)
to further strengthen their economies.
Sri Lanka's adoption of India's
Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
has improved fintech connections, and using the rupee for trade supports its economy.
Cultural Relations:
1977 Cultural Cooperation Agreement
has enabled cultural exchanges, while the
Indian Cultural Centre
in Colombo promotes Indian arts and organizes
International Yoga Day.
Additionally, the India-Sri Lanka Foundation, established in 1998, strengthens scientific and cultural collaboration
Defence and Security Cooperation:

Indo-Sri Lankan Defence Dialogue,
focusing on security partnerships. Both nations conduct
joint military (Mitra Shakti) and naval (SLINEX)
exercises to enhance their defence collaboration.

What are the Challenges in India-Sri Lanka Relations?
Political Instability:
Sri Lanka has faced political turbulence in recent years, characterised by frequent government changes, which has impeded its ability to engage with India and pursue cooperative economic initiatives.
Geographical Concerns:
India recognises Sri Lanka's sovereignty over
Katchatheevu under the 1974
agreement, but political commentary over the island and the authenticity of the agreement raise diplomatic concerns between the countries.
Strategic Concerns:
China's establishment of the
Colombo and Hambantota ports
under its
Maritime Silk Route initiative
poses strategic challenges for India. Moreover, China has partnered with
Sri Lanka’s Supreme SAT
satellite launch operations.
Fishermen's Issue:
Sri Lanka has consistently voiced concerns over illegal fishing by Indian fishermen in its waters, resulting in regular arrests for violating the
International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL).
Tamilian Interests:
India seeks to fulfil the Tamil community's aspirations for
equality, justice, and peace,
promoting the devolution of powers as outlined in the 13th Amendment. However, Colombo has yet to demonstrate a firm commitment in this regard.
Border Security Concern:
The porous maritime border between India and Sri Lanka has resulted in challenges related to border security, including the smuggling of goods, narcotics, and illegal immigrants.
Way Forward
Enhanced Maritime Security:
India and Sri Lanka can strengthen maritime security collaboration through joint patrols in the Indian Ocean and by offering training programs for Sri Lankan coast guard personnel.
Cultural Exchange:
Cultural exchange initiatives, people-to-people connections and tourism can be promoted to deepen relationships between the citizens of both nations.
Initiatives such as student exchange programs and skill development can be established to provide scholarships for Sri Lankan students and to collaborate on skill development programs.
Developmental  Projects:
India can invest in infrastructure development in Sri Lanka, ensuring that projects transition smoothly from planning to execution.
Trade Facilitation: Both countries can aim for a prompt and efficient implementation of
the Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA)
to lower trade barriers and enhance bilateral trade.
Truth and Reconciliation Commission:
India could help set up a truth and reconciliation commission in Sri Lanka,
similar to South Africa's,
to address the legacy of the civil war and promote healing within the Tamil community.
Drishti Mains Question:
What are the key highlights of India-Sri Lanka relations, the challenges they face, and how can both countries collaborate to overcome these issues?
