Substantive Equality of Opportunity
Why in News?
Giving states the power to sub-classify Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) for reservation in jobs and education, the Supreme Court said the move would provide “substantive equality of opportunity for the backward classes”.
A 7-judge bench (in a 6:1 order) overruled a 2005 five-judge bench verdict in the E.V. Chinnaiah case that outlawed the Andhra Pradesh government’s notification to sub-categorise SC/STs in the state.

A History of the SC's Past Interpretations on Affirmative Action
What is the Chinnaiah Judgment (2005)?
SC’s Verdict in the State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh Case (2024)
A History of the SC's Past Interpretations on Affirmative Action:
Formalistic reading - Reservations as an exception to the principle of equal opportunity:
In the State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (1951)
, it was held that reservation of seats in educational institutions was unconstitutional.
There was no express provision that allowed this, like Article 16(4) of the Constitution did for public employment.
This led to Parliament enacting
the first amendment to the Constitution in 1951
, which inserted Article 15(4).
(which is essentially an exception to Article 29) enables the State to make special provisions for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the SCs and the STs.
In Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992)
(Mandal judgment), the court observed that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are
special provisions or an exception to the principle of equality.
Substantive reading of the equality code:
In M R Balaji v State of Mysore (1962)
, the court for the first time prescribed a 50% ceiling for reservation. With the exception of the 10% EWS quota, this limit is disputed but has persisted.
In State of Kerala v. N M Thomas (1975)
, the SC upheld a Kerala law in which the qualifying criteria for government jobs was relaxed for SC and ST candidates.
Limiting efficiency:
Article 335 of the Constitution
, which provides for reservation for SCs and STs in services and posts, states that the reservation
must be taken consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration
In the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment
, the SC held that reservations in promotions would dilute efficiency in administration.
The Supreme Court had observed that SCs form
a class by themselves
and any further classification would
violate the doctrine of reasonableness
, amount to “
discrimination in reverse
”, and would run
contrary to Article 14
(right to equality).
Because the
Indra Sawhney case
(1992) clearly stated that it was ruling exclusively on the sub-classification of OBCs, the apex court decided that the principle of sub-classification of OBCs in that case will not apply to SCs.
Since SC/STs are notified by the President, the top court had said that the objective of the notification was to afford special protection to
SCs as a homogeneous group
In 2020,
a reference made by a 3-judge bench to a larger bench held that it was not convinced by the Chinnaiah decision.
This 3-judge bench was hearing an appeal arising from the Punjab and Haryana HC, which quashed a Punjab legislation, which reserved 50% vacancies for Valmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs (within a quota of 25% for SCs).
SC’s Verdict in the State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh Case (2024):
Underlining substantive equality
The Chief Justice of India (CJI)
underlined the concept of substantive equality - the principle that the law must account for the different backgrounds and historical injustices faced by persons or groups.
Declaring SC/STs to be a heterogeneous group,
the majority verdict said its sub-categorisation is a constitutional requirement to secure substantive equality.
The State can employ a range of means (including subclassification within the SCs) under the Constitution to secure substantive equality,
provided it does not lead to the exclusion
of one of the categories in the class.
This is to
expand the sphere and the scope of the reservation
to ensure that the benefits trickle down
to those who need it the most.
Reframed the quota-versus-efficiency question:
The CJI has argued that securing higher marks in an examination does not contribute to higher efficiency.
The stereotype that reservation leads to inefficiency in fact makes promotions inaccessible to SC/ST candidates.

**********New tech promises to kill weeds in rice and wheat fields
Why in news?
Agricultural scientists and policymakers have long sought methods to cultivate rice and wheat with reduced water usage and without burning leftover straw or extensive land preparation.
In this context, the recent breakthroughs are silver lining in rice and wheat production as these involve breeding rice and wheat varieties/hybrids that tolerate the herbicide Imazethapyr, which controls competing weeds.
What’s in today’s article?
Recent breakthroughs in rice and wheat fields
Prevailing practices to control weeds
Herbicide-tolerant solutions
Are these solutions genetically modified (GM) crops?
Conclusion
Rice fields
In the current kharif season, two basmati rice varieties (
Pusa Basmati 1979 and Pusa Basmati 1985
) and two non-basmati rice hybrids (
Sava 134 and Sava 127
) have been commercially planted.
These were developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and Savannah Seeds Pvt. Ltd.
These contain a mutated
acetolactate synthase (ALS)
gene that enables farmers to spray Imazethapyr for controlling weeds in rice.
Common weeds affecting rice cultivation are: Echinochloa colona (commonly called jangli chawal), Cyperus rotundus (motha) and Trianthema portulacastrum (patthar-chatta).
Wheat Fields
In the upcoming rabi season, Mahyco Pvt. Ltd plans to launch Imazethapyr-tolerant wheat varieties,
Goal and Mukut
Imazethapyr is used for controlling Phalaris minor (gulli danda), Chenopodium album (bathua) and other such major weeds.
Mahyco and Savannah Seeds have partnered to promote their 'FullPage' direct seeded rice (DSR) and 'FreeHit' zero-tillage (ZT) wheat technologies, aiming to make farming more climate-smart and sustainable.
Farmers traditionally control weeds in rice and wheat fields through intensive water use and ploughing.
For rice
Farmers create nurseries to grow young plants, which are transplanted after 30 days into puddled fields.
These fields are kept flooded for the first 2-3 weeks to prevent weed growth and then irrigated weekly for the remainder of the 155-160 day growing season.
This method requires up to 30 irrigations per acre, each using over 200,000 liters of water, plus significant labor costs for transplanting.
For Wheat
Farmers burn the leftover paddy straw and plough the field multiple times to manage weeds.
This involves initial ploughing with a harrow or cultivator, followed by irrigation, and additional ploughing with either a rotavator or harrow/cultivator before sowing wheat seeds.
Solutions
Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) and Zero-Tillage (ZT) wheat technologies replace traditional water-intensive and ploughing methods with the herbicide Imazethapyr for weed control.
DSR eliminates the need for paddy nurseries, puddling, transplanting, and flooding, allowing paddy seeds to be sown directly like wheat.
The land only requires laser leveling before sowing, costing about Rs 1,200/acre. This method saves around 30% of water and reduces labor and fuel costs.
The ‘
FreeHit’ ZT technology for wheat
, developed by Mahyco, allows direct sowing without burning paddy stubble or land preparation.
Farmers can use a tractor-mounted Super Seeder with rotavator to cut and mix standing stubble into the soil or a Happy Seeder to cut and leave crop residue on the field. This no-tillage approach saves cost and time.
Imazethapyr, along with Metribuzin, is sprayed when the wheat crop is about 25 days old for effective weed management
No, they just have an acetolactate synthase (ALS) that has undergone mutation
. This gene is already present in rice and wheat.
These are not introduced from soil bacteria or other unrelated species, as with Monsanto’s ‘Bollgard’ Bt cotton and the still-to-be-approved GM hybrid mustard bred by scientists at Delhi University’s Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants.
This gene codes for an enzyme crucial for synthesizing essential amino acids needed for plant growth.
Normally, the herbicide Imazethapyr binds to these ALS enzymes, inhibiting amino acid production and killing both the crop and weeds.
However, the mutated ALS gene in these new varieties has an altered DNA sequence, preventing Imazethapyr from binding to the enzyme.
This mutation allows the plants to tolerate the herbicide, which then only targets and kills the weeds.
This differs from genetically modified crops like Monsanto’s ‘Bollgard’ Bt cotton, as the mutation is achieved through chemical or radiation methods, not by introducing genes from unrelated species.
The adoption of Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) and Zero-Tillage (ZT) technologies, which offer benefits like reduced water and fuel consumption and the elimination of environmental pollution from crop residue burning, is likely to improve with herbicide-tolerant varieties. Additionally, the fact that these crops are not genetically modified (GM) may further facilitate their acceptance.
