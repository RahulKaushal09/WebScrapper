**********What are Orphan drugs?
India faces significant challenges in ensuring the development, affordability, and accessibility of orphan drugs, especially compared to other countries like the United States and the European Union.
About
Orphan drugs:
These are pharmaceutical agents developed specifically to
treat rare (orphan) diseases.
These diseases, though affecting only a small portion of the population, often lead to life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions. Definitions of orphan drugs vary depending on the regulatory framework.
There is
no formal prevalence-based definition in India,
the NPRD of 2021 outlines a framework for diagnosing and treating rare diseases, with a low prevalence threshold expected.
Orphan drugs are categorised based on the types of diseases they target and their regulatory status.
Diseases such as
genetic disorders, rare cancers, metabolic disorders
autoimmune conditions
frequently fall under the orphan disease category.
Genetic disorders
include conditions like cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Rare cancers
like neuroblastoma and gliomas also qualify for orphan drug development.
Metabolic disorders,
such as Gaucher’s disease and Fabry disease, and autoimmune diseases, like systemic sclerosis, also benefit from orphan drugs.
For a drug to receive orphan drug designation, it must
meet certain criteria
that vary across countries.
Typically, the disease in question
must have a low prevalence,
the condition must
lack approved treatments
, or the orphan drug must provide significant benefits over current treatment options.
Developers of orphan drugs must also provide scientific evidence that the drug has the potential to treat or alleviate the condition.
This evidence can be presented at any stage of drug development, from preclinical research to late-phase clinical trials.
Once designated, orphan drugs receive
several incentives to encourage their development,
including market exclusivity, tax credits for research and development (R&D) expenses and fee waivers for regulatory applications.

**********US Elections and Chinese Stimulus Drive Recent FPI Selloff in India
Why in news?
Benchmark indices faced renewed selling pressure on November 4, with all sectoral indices declining in early trade. The selloff was triggered by multiple factors, primarily external ones, which outweighed domestic influences.
What’s in today’s article?
Benchmark Indices in India
Factors triggering FPI selloff
About
Benchmark indices in India are key indicators of the overall performance of the stock market.
They represent a selection of top-performing companies and are used to gauge market trends and investor sentiment.
Main benchmark indices
Sensex (BSE Sensex)
This is the benchmark index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), comprising 30 of the largest and most actively traded stocks on the BSE.
Established in 1986, the Sensex reflects the performance of companies from various sectors, such as finance, IT, and manufacturing, and serves as a barometer for the Indian economy.
Nifty 50 (NSE Nifty)
The Nifty 50 is the benchmark index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), comprising 50 large-cap companies across 14 sectors.
Launched in 1996, it provides a broader representation of the market compared to the Sensex and is widely used by investors as a benchmark for mutual funds and ETFs.
Importance of Benchmark Indices
Market Trends
: They indicate the direction of the stock market, helping investors understand bullish or bearish trends.
Performance Gauge
: Indices serve as performance benchmarks for mutual funds and portfolio managers.
Economic Health:
Movements in these indices often reflect the health and stability of the economy, as they are influenced by corporate earnings, market sentiment, and economic policies.
Domestic triggers
The market's bearish sentiment is partly due to concerns over weak corporate outlooks and possible earnings cuts, prompting a re-evaluation of stock valuations.
Additionally, domestic investors, like mutual funds, are not buying enough to offset foreign portfolio investor (FPI) selloffs, unlike previous corrections.
Furthermore,
expectations of an RBI rate cut by December have faded
, with persistent inflation risks suggesting any rate cut might be delayed until late 2025.
These factors are overshadowing hopes for increased government spending, which has remained subdued in the first half of the fiscal year.
US elections-linked volatility, Fed trajectory
Indian markets are experiencing heightened volatility due to the close U.S. presidential election, with a potential Trump win viewed as favorable for U.S. stocks and the dollar but negative for treasuries.
Additionally, the
Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy meeting on November 6-7 has raised concerns that rates might be held steady
, dampening hopes for further rate cuts.
The biggest external factor, however, is China, as FPIs shift focus there amid India’s overvaluation concerns and lackluster corporate earnings.
This pivot is driving aggressive FPI selling in Indian markets.
China Factor
As the U.S. election unfolds, China's Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress is holding a significant meeting expected to result in a major economic stimulus package.
This package may fund land and property purchases, bank recapitalizations, provincial debt refinancing, and household support.
If Trump wins, t
ariffs of over 50% on Chinese goods could lead to a 2% drop in China’s growth, prompting an even larger stimulus response
Analysts predict China’s stimulus could reach 2-3% of its GDP annually if Trump secures a second term, potentially reducing India’s appeal to FPIs.
Additionally, on November 1,
China’s central bank introduced a $70 billion stimulus injection
—the largest since COVID-19—to address liquidity concerns and revive bank lending after recent economic growth slowed to a five-quarter low.
This substantial fiscal move signals China’s commitment to stabilizing its economy, with potential ripple effects across global markets, including India.

**********Election Day in US
Why in news?
The US Presidential Election is set to commence on November 5, with a thrilling race anticipated between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.
The decisive outcome hinges on the Electoral College, especially in seven key "swing states" where the race remains extremely tight, making the final result uncertain.
What’s in today’s article?
U.S. Presidential Election
Electoral College Mechanism in US
Role of Seven Swing States
Overview
The U.S. presidential election is held every
four years
to elect the President and Vice President of the United States.
It follows an indirect voting process
, where citizens vote for a slate of electors who then choose the President and Vice President.
Constitutional requirements for presidential candidates
The U.S. Constitution states that the president must:
Be a natural-born citizen of the United States
Be at least 35 years old
Have been a resident of the United States for 14 years
Primary Elections and Caucuses
Primaries and caucuses are two ways that people help states and political parties choose presidential nominees.
These take place in each state and run from early in the election year until the summer.
During this stage, party members vote for their preferred candidates, and delegates are assigned to represent these choices at the national conventions.
National Conventions
Following the primaries, each party holds a national convention where delegates officially nominate the party’s candidates for President and Vice President.
The nominees then accept the party's nomination, and the general election campaign begins.
The General Election
The general election occurs on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
Voters in each state cast their ballots for President, effectively choosing electors who will represent their state in the Electoral College.
Electoral College Voting and Inauguration
In December, the electors meet in their respective state capitals to cast their official votes.
These votes are counted by Congress in early January, and the President-elect is formally declared.
The elected President is then inaugurated on January 20, marking the official start of their term in office.
Electoral College System
Americans don't directly vote for the President
; instead, they vote for electors who form the Electoral College.
There are 538 electors, and a candidate needs 270 to win the presidency.
Allocation of Electors
Each state has a designated number of electors, roughly based on its population.
By voting for a candidate, voters are actually choosing that candidate’s party-designated electors for their state.
Winner-Takes-All Rule
Most states use a winner-takes-all system (except Maine and Nebraska), where the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all its electoral votes.
This system often makes the outcome in solidly Democratic or Republican states predictable.
Importance of Swing States
Due to this system, close races in a few "swing states" hold significant influence over the election, as the overall outcome depends on who reaches the 270 electoral vote threshold first.
Duties and voting by electors:
Electors meet in December to formally vote for the President and Vice President.
While electors traditionally vote in line with their party's candidate, there is
no federal law binding them to do so.
However,
many states have laws
enforcing elector loyalty, and faithless electors are rare, as seen in the 2016 election.
Role of Swing States
Some states, known as “swing states” or “battleground states,” have historically close races and can vote either Democratic or Republican.
These states play a pivotal role, as the winner-takes-all system makes their outcome critical to securing the required 270 electoral votes.
Swing states in this year’s election
Seven key swing states—Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada—are critical in the current U.S. presidential election.
Together, these states hold 93 Electoral College votes and are being heavily targeted by both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump’s campaigns.

**********Does Data Justify Subdivision of Quotas?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Reservation in India (Foundation, Evolution, Disparities, Access, Issues, etc.)
Conclusion
Background:
India’s reservation system has been instrumental in providing access to opportunities for historically marginalized communities, especially
Scheduled Castes
(SCs) and
Scheduled Tribes
(STs).
However, recent debates question whether the benefits of this system are equitably distributed among all SC subgroups.
The Supreme Court has proposed introducing a “
quota-within-quota
” to address these disparities, leading to a nationwide discussion on whether such measures are justified by data.
Foundation & Evolution of Reservation in India:
The reservation policy, rooted in
B.R. Ambedkar’s vision
, aimed to create equal opportunities by reserving spots in education, public employment, and governance for marginalized communities.
While the intention was to dismantle caste-based inequalities, the outcomes have been uneven, with some SC subgroups reportedly benefiting more than others.
As a result, there are
growing calls to redesign the reservation system
to ensure a balanced distribution of opportunities.
Disparities Among SC Subgroups:
Using data from states like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal, researchers have found significant disparities in the outcomes of reservation policies:
: Since 1975, Punjab has implemented a subdivided quota system, benefiting disadvantaged SC subgroups like the Mazhabi Sikhs and Balmikis, helping them catch up to more advanced subgroups.
: The state created a “
Mahadalit
” category in 2007 to target marginalized SC groups. However, political pressures expanded the category to include all SC groups, diluting its effectiveness.
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu
: These states have relatively balanced outcomes between their major SC groups, indicating that a further subdivision of quotas may not be necessary.
Across these states, the data reveals that while disparities exist within the SC category, the gap between SCs and upper-caste groups is still much larger.
This suggests that while a quota subdivision may help address some disparities within the SC category, it may not be a complete solution.
Access to Reserved Opportunities:
A fundamental challenge in India’s reservation system is ensuring access to reserved benefits.
Data from the
India Human Development Survey
(IHDS) reveals that a significant portion of SC households in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar lack caste certificates—essential for accessing reserved positions in education and employment.
This highlights a need to improve access to reservation benefits rather than focusing solely on quota subdivision.
Potential Issues with Quota Subdivision:
While the idea of a “quota-within-quota” has merit in states like Punjab, data suggests that it may not be necessary everywhere.
In states where SC groups have comparable socio-economic outcomes, further subdivisions could complicate the reservation system without delivering substantial benefits.
Additionally, the subdivision policy is often vulnerable to political motivations, as seen in Bihar, where expanding the “Mahadalit” category diluted its impact.
The Supreme Court’s recommendation to introduce a “
creamy layer
” exclusion for SCs is another contentious proposal.
While excluding economically advantaged SC individuals from reservation benefits could theoretically enhance equity, experts caution that economic mobility may not necessarily reduce caste-based discrimination.
Instances of both overt and covert untouchability persist, suggesting that social identity, rather than economic status, continues to influence discrimination.
Need for Updated Data:
India’s national Census
, currently delayed, is the most comprehensive source of data on caste-based disparities.
Updated data is crucial to ensure that reservation policies are based on current socio-economic realities rather than outdated information.
Without reliable data, any attempt to reform the reservation system may be misguided.
Conclusion:
India’s reservation system has uplifted many marginalized groups, yet it faces challenges in delivering equitable outcomes within the SC category.
A quota-within-quota system may benefit states with pronounced disparities, but it is not a universal solution.
Improving access to reservation benefits and addressing caste-based discrimination across the board should be prioritized.
Moving forward,
reservation policies should be informed by robust, updated data to ensure they serve as genuine tools for social justice

**********Debate Surrounding Village Relocation for Tiger Reserves
Why in News?
The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has intervened in the debate surrounding village relocations from tiger reserves.
The commission responded to complaints against the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s (NTCA) June advisory requesting state forest departments to submit action plans for village relocations.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Legal and Procedural Requirements for Relocation
Debate Surrounding Village Relocations from Tiger Reserves
Conclusion
Legal and Procedural Requirements for Relocation:
Families living inside tiger habitat:
As per NTCA, 591 villages comprising 64,801 families live inside critical tiger habitats, also known as core areas, in 54 tiger reserves across 19 states.
So far, 251 villages with 25,007 families have been relocated outside tiger reserves.
Legal requirements:
Under the Wildlife Protection Act
, areas free of human settlements can be created in the core of tiger reserves.
However, this is to be done after recognising the rights of tribal communities under
the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006
, and with the informed
consent of the Gram Sabha
Procedural requirements (Voluntary Village Relocation Program [VVRP] of the NTCA):
Additionally, before the voluntary relocation,
The state government has to conclude
(based on consultations with ecological and social scientists),
That the activities of the tribal communities or forest dwellers or their presence are sufficient to
cause irreversible damage to tigers and their habitat.
They have to also conclude that there is
no other reasonable option
for the community to co-exist with tigers.
Compensation:
The NTCA had raised the
relocation compensation
for families opting for voluntary relocation
from ₹10 lakh to ₹15 lakh per family in 2021.
Those accepting the resettlement package receive two hectares of land, homestead land, house construction assistance, a financial incentive, and basic amenities, including water, sanitation, electricity, and telecommunication.
Debate Surrounding Village Relocations from Tiger Reserves:
Opposition to NTCA's advisory:
NTCA advised state forest departments to
prioritise the relocation of villages from core tiger habitats across 54 tiger reserves
However, this advisory prompted pushback from over 150 tribal rights groups and activists.
The petition to NCST pointed out that the NTCA letter did not dwell on the legal and procedural requirements, making it violative of laws.
They argued that NTCA's approach violates FRA and the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act 2006, as
village relocation should be voluntary
NCST take on NTCA advisory:
NCST requested an update
from NTCA on village relocations and their adherence to NCST's prior recommendations.
The commission also seeks an action-taken report
from the Union Environment Ministry and NTCA on its 2018 recommendations to revise the compensation for villagers who voluntarily relocate from tiger reserves.
The NCST wants to ensure this package aligns with the
2013 Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act’s
guidelines and entitlements.
Conclusion:
NCST’s intervention underscores the
need to balance tiger conservation with tribal rights
, ensuring that relocation policies comply with legal requirements.
By engaging with NTCA, the Environment Ministry, and tribal representatives, NCST aims to
create a fair relocation framework
that respects both conservation goals and tribal communities’ rights.

**********Explained: The paradox of stagnant rural wages
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to Rural Governance;
Why in the News?
From 2019-20 to 2023-24, India’s economy grew at 4.6% annually, with the farm sector at 4.2%, yet rural wages remain stagnant.
Disparity between Rural Wages and Economic Growth:
Divergent Growth Trends
: While the Indian economy has experienced significant GDP growth
(averaging 4.6% annually from 2019-20 to 2023-24)
, rural wages have stagnated, with real agricultural wages showing minimal growth and often negative real wage growth due to rising inflation.
Labor Supply Dynamics
: The surge in
female Labor Force Participation Rates (LFPR)
in rural areas has increased the overall labor supply, exerting downward pressure on wages as more workers compete for the same or fewer jobs, primarily in low-productivity agricultural sectors.
Capital-Intensive Growth
: Economic growth has become increasingly capital-intensive and labor-saving, leading to a disproportionate share of income going to capital rather than labour.
This trend results in fewer job opportunities in high-paying sectors, further exacerbating the stagnation of rural wages.
What are the major factors behind the Stagnant Rural Wages?
Increased Female Labour Force Participation (Surplus of Labour)
: The rural female Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) has seen a sharp rise, particularly due to government initiatives that have freed up women’s time for outside employment.
However, this has led to a significant increase in the overall rural workforce, causing a surplus of labor that exerts downward pressure on wages.
Majority of choosing Agricultural Employment
: Although more women are entering the labour force, the majority are finding employment in agriculture rather than in higher-paying non-farm sectors.
This results in a surplus of workers in an already low-productivity sector, which suppresses wages further.
Capital-Intensive Economic Growth
: The Indian economy’s growth has increasingly come from capital-intensive sectors that require fewer workers.
Consequently, the share of income generated is shifting from
labour (wages) to capital (profits)
. This trend limits demand for rural labour, leading to wage stagnation.
Low Demand for Non-Agricultural Labor
: Wage growth in rural non-agricultural sectors has been even weaker, with real wages declining. This reflects limited job opportunities outside of agriculture, partly due to low demand for labour in industries that are more capital-intensive.
What are the steps taken by Govt to address the issue of Low Rural Wages?
Income Transfer Schemes
: Both central and state governments have introduced various income transfer schemes, like
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)
which provides an annual income support of Rs 6,000 to farmer households in rural areas.
Many states have launched income-support schemes specifically for women, such as
Maharashtra’s Ladki Bahin Yojana
, which provides Rs 1,500 per month to women from low-income households.
Employment Generation Programs
: Schemes like the
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)
provide a safety net by guaranteeing 100 days of wage employment for rural households.
The government has also promoted rural entrepreneurship through initiatives like the
Mudra Yojana,
which offers micro-loans to rural businesses and enhance employment opportunities.
Skill Development Initiatives
: The government has been investing in rural skill development programs to promote employability in non-farm sectors.
Programs under schemes like the
Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY)
focus on upskilling rural youth and women to enable them to find better-paying, non-agricultural employment.
Rural Infrastructure Development
: Initiatives to build rural infrastructure, such as the
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY),
create temporary employment in construction and improve access to jobs, markets, and services.
Way forward:
Diversification of Employment Opportunities
: Enhancing support for non-agricultural sectors through targeted investments in skill development, vocational training, and entrepreneurship programs can create diverse job opportunities.
Strengthening Agricultural Productivity
: Implementing policies that focus on modernizing agricultural practices and improving productivity can increase the income of rural labourers.
Mains PYQ:
Though there have been several different estimates of poverty in India, all indicate reduction in poverty over time. Do you agree. Critically examine with reference to urban and rural poverty indicators.
(2015)
Examine the pattern and trend of public expenditure on social services in the post-reforms period in India. To what extent this has been in consonance with achieving the objective of inclusive growth?

**********What Australian varsity study says about impact of India’s Dedicated Freight Corridors
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Significance of Infrastructure; Infrastructural development;
Why in the News?
Dedicated Freight Corridors are boosting India’s GDP and significantly enhancing Indian Railways’ revenue, according to a recent study by Australia’s University of New South Wales.
What are dedicated freight corridors (DFCs)?
Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) are specialized railway tracks for freight transportation, designed to improve efficiency with faster, high-capacity trains like double-stack containers and heavy-haul freight trains.
What is the Present Status?
India has two main DFCs:
Eastern DFC (EDFC):
Spanning 1,337 km from Sonnagar (Bihar) to Sahnewal (Punjab). The EDFC is operational and includes feeder routes connecting coal mines and thermal plants.
Western DFC (WDFC):
Extends 1,506 km from Jawaharlal Nehru Port (Mumbai) to Dadri (Uttar Pradesh). The WDFC is 93% complete, serving major ports in Gujarat. Full completion is expected by December 2025.
As of March 31, 2024, the project has incurred costs of ₹94,091 crore, excluding land acquisition.
What does the Australian varsity study say?
Conducted by the
, this study used a Computable General Equilibrium model to assess the WDFC’s impact, specifically from
FY 2019–20.
study’s findings
include:
Reduced freight costs and travel times have decreased commodity prices by
up to 0.5%.
The DFCs contributed to a
2.94% increase in Indian Railways’ revenue
between FY 2022–23 and FY 2018–19.
Western regions gained significantly from reduced freight costs, which had a
“social-equalizing effect
,” benefiting states with lower per capita GDP.
Published in
Elsevier
, the study integrated freight costs, industry inputs, population data, and rail and road data.
What economic benefits do Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) bring to India?
Improved Supply Chains:
DFCs provide faster, efficient transit for freight, enhancing the supply chain for industries and logistics providers.
Cost Savings:
Reduction in freight transport costs lowers overall logistics expenses, which can lead to price reductions for consumers.
Revenue Growth for Railways:
DFCs have directly contributed to revenue increases, supporting the Railways’ finances.
Increased Freight Share:
The corridors are key to meeting the National Rail Plan’s target of achieving a 45% rail share in freight by 2030.
Exports and Imports:
Faster, dedicated freight routes boost export-import activities, as DFCs support port connectivity, particularly in the West.
How do DFCs enhance the overall logistics and transportation infrastructure in India?
Decongested Rail Network:
By shifting freight traffic off the main passenger routes (e.g., the Golden Quadrilateral), DFCs alleviate congestion, improving both freight and passenger rail reliability.
Regional Development:
States along the DFC routes experience increased industrial activity due to improved logistics support, which can enhance local economies and job creation.
Future Corridors:
Plans are underway for four additional corridors (East Coast, East-West I & II, North-South) to further expand the freight network, enhancing connectivity across the country.
Current Operational Status and Future Outlook
As of now,
325 trains run daily on the DFCs
, which is a 60% increase from the previous year.
DFC trains are faster, safer, and capable of carrying heavier loads, contributing to over
10% of Indian Railways’ total freight operations
DFCCIL is conducting further research on DFCs’ economic impact, with results expected soon, which will provide deeper insights into their long-term contributions to India’s economic growth.
Challenges related to the development of DFC:
Land Acquisition Delays
: Acquiring
over 8,800 hectares
often privately owned and developed land, has caused setbacks, with disputes and legal cases prolonging the process.
Escalating Costs
: Project costs have surged significantly, with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JBIC) noting that expenses have nearly doubled, raising concerns about financial viability and potential investor reluctance.
Technology Disputes
: Differences over locomotive technology—diesel versus electric—pose delays, as stakeholders like Indian Railways and JBIC debate environmentally friendly solutions.
Utility and Infrastructure Challenges
: Shifting utilities (power lines, water pipes) and constructing road overbridges and under-bridges add logistical complexities.
Funding and Financial Management
: Reliance on external funding and the need for efficient resource management impact project timelines and execution stability.
Way Forward:
Streamlined Land Acquisition and Cost Management
: Need to implement a centralized framework for faster land acquisition and cost oversight to mitigate delays and prevent cost escalations, ensuring project feasibility and investor confidence.
Technological and Funding Consensus
: Need to establish clear technology standards (e.g., electric locomotives) for environmental benefits and secure diversified funding sources to reduce dependence on external financing, enabling timely completion and sustainable operations.
