Who are Hatti tribes?
The vibrant Boda Tyohar festival, the largest annual celebration for the Hatti tribes of the Trans-Giri region in Himachal Pradesh, kicked off recently with much enthusiasm and traditional fervour.
About Hattis:
They are a close-knit community who
take their name from
traditional occupation
of selling home-grown crops, vegetables, meat, and wool
at small-town markets known as ‘haats’.
There are
two main Hatti clans
one in the Trans-Giri area of the Sirmaur district in Himachal Pradesh
and the
other in Jaunsar Bawar of Uttarakhand.
The two Hatti clans have
similar traditions
intermarriages are common.
They are governed by a
traditional council called ‘khumbli’
which decides community matters.
The Hatti homeland straddles the
Himachal-Uttarakhand border
basin of the Giri and Tons rivers,
both tributaries of the Yamuna. The Tons marks the border between the two states.
Hatti men
traditionally don a
distinctive white headgear on ceremonial occasions
Economy
The Hatti population relies on
agriculture
for livelihood and bare subsistence since their climate is ideal for growing "Cash Crops."
Moreover, the rise in Kinnaur, Lahaul, and Spiti's seasonal tourism, often called “
eco-tourism
”, served as a merged source of income.
According to the 2011 census, members of the community numbered 2.5 lakh, but at present population of the Hattis is estimated at around 3 lakhs.
In 2023, the Government of India granted
Scheduled Tribe (ST)
status to the
Hatti community in Himachal Pradesh.
Jaunsar-Bawar region
of Uttarakhand was
granted tribal status in 1967.

**********Esterase Enzyme
A team of researchers has successfully used an enzyme — esterase enzyme —to break down diethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP) plasticizer.
About Esterase Enzyme:
It is produced by soil bacteria
Sulfobacillus acidophilus.
The enzyme was structurally characterized using X-ray crystallography.
It remains active for about a month and catalyzes the
degradation of diethyl hexyl phthalate
(DEHP) plasticizer with significant efficiency.
It breaks down the DEHP plasticizer into two products —
mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and 2-ethyl hexanol.
This esterase enzyme, along with other enzymes identified by their group previously, can convert high molecular weight phthalate
plasticizers into water and carbon-dioxide.
Researchers also found that the esterase enzyme can bind to molecules similar to
polypropylene
used in plastics, making it a potential tool for
extracting polypropylene from contaminated water sources
Researchers also found three other enzymes from
Comamonas testosteroni
bacteria in 2017, that breaks down the phthalates produced by DEHP degradation into carbon-dioxide and water.
Putting all the enzymes into bacteria will speed up the degradation process.
Mechanism:
They used the enzymes in sequence to first break down
DEHP to MEHP
and 2-ethyl hexanol using esterase enzyme.
MEHP was degraded to phthalate
using another enzyme.
phthalate was then converted to intermediate compounds
using a third enzyme (phthalate dioxygenase).
intermediate compounds then converted into protocatechuate
by the enzyme phthalate decarboxylase.
Once protocatechuate is produced, the tricarboxylic acid cycle of the bacteria, which is common in all bacteria, converts it to
The enzymes, whether used for degradation or not, will remain active only for a short time. But once integrated into bacteria, they
remain active for a longer time and the bacteria
can be used continuously for degrading the plasticizers.
But when the enzymes are used without integrating into bacteria, a fresh batch of enzymes needs to be produced to continue the degradation process.
What are Plasticizers?
These are chemicals
added to plastics and personal care products
to enhance flexibility and shine, and are commonly found in items such as baby toys, shampoos, soaps, and food containers.
Plasticizers can be
absorbed through the skin
, making them a direct
threat to human health.

**********Are Lithium Batteries on Flight Dangerous?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Concern about Lithium Batteries (Opinion of IFALPA, Case Studies, Mitigation Strategies, Implications, etc.)
Conclusion
Background:
Lithium-ion batteries have become integral to modern technology due to their high energy density, rechargeability, and versatility.
These batteries power a wide range of devices, from electric vehicles (EVs) to consumer electronics. However, their growing use in aviation has raised significant safety concerns, particularly regarding their fire risks.
International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations
(IFALPA) recently issued position papers highlighting the dangers posed by lithium-ion batteries in airport and aircraft environments.
The IFALPA is a global non-profit representing the international community of professional pilots.
Why Are Lithium Batteries a Concern?
Lithium-ion batteries, while efficient, can catch fire under certain physical or environmental stresses.
Fires are caused by short circuits within the battery, which lead to continuous production of heat, oxygen, and electric current. Factors contributing to these risks include:
Mechanical Abuse
: Deformation of internal structures.
Electrical Abuse
: Degraded performance due to improper usage or charging.
Thermal Abuse
: Heat accumulation leading to a "thermal runaway."
For example, after Hurricane Helene in 2024, 48 lithium-ion batteries caught fire due to prolonged exposure to salt water, underscoring the risks associated with improper battery ratings for extreme conditions like flooding.
Position Papers by IFALPA:
The IFALPA’s position papers (POS01, POS02, and POS03) address various aspects of lithium battery safety:
POS01 - Safe Transport of Batteries
Focuses on UN regulations
3480
3481
for air transport of lithium-ion batteries.
Calls for extending the
30% state-of-charge (SOC) limit
to equipment with built-in batteries (UN3481) to reduce fire risks during transportation.
POS02 - Fire Safety Protocols
Highlights that fires caused by lithium-ion batteries differ from traditional fires.
Calls for airports and ground services to develop specialized fire-safety equipment and protocols to handle these incidents effectively.
POS03 - Risks in Flight Decks
Raises concerns about batteries in critical aircraft components.
Cites studies by the
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)
showing that existing fire kits are inadequate for high-energy lithium-ion battery fires.
Case Studies and Data:
Energy Density Concerns
: Modern lithium-ion batteries have become more energy-dense, increasing their potential for catastrophic fires. This poses challenges for firefighting and containment.
Toxic Fumes
: When these batteries burn, they release hazardous fumes, requiring specialized safety measures.
Inadequate Fire Kits
: Research indicates that current firefighting kits fail to address battery fires effectively, particularly those with an energy rating exceeding 100 Wh.
Proposed Mitigation Strategies:
Enhanced Packaging and Labelling
Adherence to strict UN regulations for bulk and equipment-contained batteries.
Implementation of SOC limits across all battery types.
Development of Specialized Equipment
Airports and rescue services should invest in purpose-built fire-safety kits designed for lithium-ion battery fires.
Regulatory Updates
Extend safety standards to address growing applications of lithium-ion batteries in aviation.
Public Awareness and Training
Educate passengers and airline personnel on safe handling and storage of lithium-ion batteries during travel.
Broader Implications:
The safety risks of lithium-ion batteries extend beyond aviation. With increasing use in electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, the need for robust safety standards is more critical than ever.
Addressing these concerns will require collaboration between industries, regulatory bodies, and researchers to develop innovative solutions for safe energy storage and transportation.
Conclusion:
Lithium-ion batteries are essential to modern life, but their potential fire hazards demand urgent attention.
The insights from IFALPA’s position papers underscore the need for enhanced safety protocols, regulatory reforms, and technological innovations.
By addressing these challenges proactively, industries can ensure the safe and sustainable use of this indispensable technology.

Iraq and Saudi Arabia were the top two suppliers of crude oil to India.
But as the West started removing itself off Russian energy supplies following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine,
Russia started offering discounts on its crude
Indian refiners took advantage of the situation, importing discounted barrels from Russia.
Shift towards West Asia:
Russia’s domestic demand surge:
Russian refineries operated at higher capacities post-autumn maintenance, reducing export volumes.
Seasonal demand in Russia capped oil exports, impacting Indian refiners reliant on Russian crude.
India’s imports from Russia:
Imports of Russian crude dropped 17% to 1.48 million barrels per day (bpd).
Russia’s market share in India’s oil basket declined to 31.5% from 38% in November.
Rising Role of West Asia in India’s Oil Imports:
Iraq’s increased share:
Iraq emerged as a key beneficiary, with imports jumping 29% to 1.13 million bpd.
Iraq’s share in India’s oil imports rose from 18.7% in November to 24% in December.
UAE’s growing presence:
UAE imports hit a 32-month high of 530,000 bpd, up 22.1% month-on-month.
UAE’s share increased to 11.2% in December, up from 9.2% in November.
Saudi Arabia’s moderate gains:
Imports from Saudi Arabia rose 4.4% to 649,000 bpd.
Riyadh’s market share grew marginally to 13.8%.
However,
Saudi Arabia was unable to capitalise on the opportunity due to its barrels being priced higher than Iraqi and Emirati oil
Price Dynamics of India’s Oil Imports:
Comparative pricing:
Russian Urals crude was priced $5.5 per barrel cheaper than Saudi Arabia’s Arab Light.
Iraq’s Basrah Medium crude was competitively priced, only $0.80 higher than Dubai crude.
Impact on Indian refiners:
Discounts on Russian crude have shrunk but remain attractive due to India’s large import volumes.
Even marginal cost savings on oil significantly benefit India, which imports over 85% of its crude needs.
Future Outlook of India’s Oil Imports:
Short-term trends:
Russian oil imports are expected to remain low in early 2025 due to domestic constraints.
Indian refiners are likely to rely more on West Asian suppliers.
Potential rebound:
Russian exports may recover during spring maintenance season, potentially resuming higher Indian imports by March-April 2025.
Conclusion:
As the world’s 3rd-largest consumer of crude oil with a high import dependency level of over 85%, India is extremely sensitive to oil prices.
The shift in India’s crude oil sourcing highlights the country’s agility in navigating global oil market dynamics.
While Russia remains a critical supplier, the growing importance of West Asian nations like Iraq and the UAE underscores
India’s strategic approach to maintaining energy security and cost efficiency.
