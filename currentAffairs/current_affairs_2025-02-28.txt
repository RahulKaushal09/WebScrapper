Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART)
The Supreme Court recently directed all States to respond to concerns relating to periodic stockouts, transparency in tendering and procurement, and drug quality and certification processes of the of Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) drugs for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV).
About Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART):
ART is a
combination of medications
that treat
human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV).
is a virus that
destroys CD4 cells
(also called
helper T-cells
), an important part of the immune system.
While
ART cannot cure HIV
, prompt HIV treatment can help all people with HIV live long, healthy lives and reduce the risk of HIV
transmission
Although there may still be HIV in the body, the
additional CD4 cells
keep the immune system strong enough to fight off infections.
By reducing the amount of HIV in the body, HIV medicines also reduce the risk of HIV transmission.
One of the main goals of HIV treatment is
to reduce a person’s viral load to an undetectable level
People with HIV who maintain an
undetectable viral load
have effectively
no risk of transmitting HIV through physical relationship
, and a
significantly lower risk of transmission through other means
(such as shared needles).
It is a combination of medications.
Taking a combination of medications,
rather than just one, makes the treatment
more effective
called “antiretroviral” because HIV is a retrovirus.
This means it uses its genetic material (
RNA
) as a template to make DNA.
Types of ART medications include:
Entry inhibitors. These include attachment inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, CCR5 antagonists and post-attachment inhibitors.
Capsid inhibitors
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)
Integrase inhibitors/integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs)
Protease inhibitors
Pharmacokinetic enhancers
Combination medications

**********Hague Service Convention
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently sought assistance from the Union Law Ministry, the central authority for India under the Hague Service Convention, to effectuate summons on Gautam Adani and his associates.
About Hague Service Convention:
Hague Service Convention, formally known as the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, 1965, was
adopted at the Hague Conference on Private International Law in 1965.
Building on the 1905 and 1954 Hague Conventions on Civil Procedure, this
multilateral treaty
ensures
that
defendants sued in foreign jurisdictions receive timely
and actual
notice of legal proceedings
while facilitating proof of service.
84 states,
including
India and the U.S., are parties
to the Convention.
Its procedures
apply only when both
sending and receiving countries are signatories.
Each member
state must also
designate a central authority
to process requests and facilitate the service of documents from other signatory states.
Signatory states can select the modes of transmission
that apply within their jurisdiction.
Under the Convention, the
primary mode of service is through designated central authorities.
However,
alternative channels
are also available, including
postal service
diplomatic and consular channels
direct communication
between judicial officers in both states, direct contact between an interested party and judicial authorities in the receiving state, and direct communication between government authorities.
How is service effectuated on defendants in India?
India acceded
to the Convention on November 23, 2006,
with certain reservations,
expressly
opposing all alternative service methods
under Article 10.
prohibits
the service of judicial documents through
diplomatic or consular channels,
except when the recipient is a national of the requesting country.
Additionally,
all service requests must be in English
or accompanied by an English translation.
As a result,
valid service can only be executed through the Ministry of Law and Justice, India’s designated central authority.
The Ministry is
permitted to reject a service request, but must specify the reasons
for such refusal.
For instance, under Article 13, a request can be denied if the state believes its sovereignty or security would be compromised.
However, a state cannot reject a service request solely because it claims exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter under its domestic law.
Similarly, under Article 29, a request cannot be refused simply because the state’s internal law does not recognise a right of action.
If the
central authority raises no objections,
proceeds with serving the defendant.
The service is then
treated as a summons issued by an Indian court
under Section 29(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
Once completed
entral authority issues an acknowledgement
to the requesting party.
The entire process typically takes six to eight months.
Can a default verdict be rendered?
A default judgment may be issued under the Convention
if a foreign government refuses to cooperate
in serving summons on a defendant residing within its jurisdiction.
However, Article 15 prescribes
specific conditions
that must be met before such a judgment can be rendered:
must have been
transmitted through
one of the
methods outlined in the Convention;
at least six months must have elapsed
since the transmission, with the court determining this period to be reasonable in the given case; and
no certificate of service has been received
despite all efforts to obtain it through the competent authorities of the recipient state.
Notably, India has expressly declared that its courts may issue a default judgment in cross-border disputes even if no certificate of service or delivery has been received, provided that all conditions under Article 15 are met.

**********General Anti Avoidance Rules
Income tax authorities may now be able to issue reassessment notices under General Anti Avoidance Rules (GAAR) under the new proposal under the Income Tax Bill 2025.
About General Anti Avoidance Rules:
It is an
anti-tax avoidance law
in India to curb tax evasion and avoid tax leaks.
It came into effect on
1st April 2017.
The GAAR provisions come under the
Income Tax Act, 1961.
It is specifically aimed at
cutting revenue losses
that happen to the government due to aggressive tax avoidance measures practiced by companies.
It is meant to apply to transactions that are prima facie legal, but result in tax reduction.
Under current rules, reassessment notices where the under-reported income is Rs ₹50 lakh or more, have to be issued within
5 years and 3 months
from the end of the assessment year.
GAAR provisions give wide powers to tax authorities to treat any arrangement or a transaction as an ‘impermissible avoidance arrangement’ (IAA) and re-compute income and consequent tax implications.

**********Blood Moon
A total lunar eclipse, or blood moon, will light up the sky on March 14 and will be visible in most parts of the world.
About Blood Moon:
It happens when Earth's moon is in a
total lunar eclipse.
How it occurs?
A blood moon occur when
Earth comes directly between the Sun and the moon
A process called Rayleigh scattering causes the moon to appear red instead of dark.
This happens because
shorter-wavelength light
(blue) is scattered, while longer-wavelength red light passes through the Earth’s atmosphere, making the moon appear red.
During totality, “the entire Moon falls within the darkest part of Earth’s shadow, called the
umbra
When the Moon is within the umbra, it appears
red-orange
.” This colour shift is what earns the event its nickname, the “
blood moon.”
Depending on external factors such as atmospheric conditions and light pollution, the moon, during a blood moon phase, may appear red, orange, or copper-coloured.
This year’s phenomenon will occur during daytime in India, thus won’t be visible in the country but will be visible in America, Western Europe, Western Africa, and the North and South Atlantic Ocean.
This total lunar eclipse marks its return after nearly three years––the last one occurring in 2022.

Recently, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral carrying NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer orbiter.
About Lunar Trailblazer Spacecraft:
It is an initiative of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Objective:
It is being sent to
find and
map water on the moon’s surface.
It is about the size of a dishwasher and relies on a relatively
small propulsion system.
It weighs about 200 kg and measures about 3.5 metres wide when its solar panels are fully deployed.
It is scheduled to
perform a series of moon flybys
and looping orbits over a span of several months to position itself to map the surface in detail.
It eventually will orbit at
an altitude of roughly 100 km
and collect high-resolution images of targeted areas to determine the form, distribution and abundance of water and to better understand the lunar water cycle.
It is carrying two instruments to achieve its science objectives:
High-resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper
(HVM3): It will look at the moon’s surface for a telltale pattern of light given off by water.
Lunar Thermal Mapper
(LTM): It will map and measure the lunar surface temperature.
When used in conjunction, these two instruments provide the ability to simultaneously identify the various forms of water on the moon, mineralogy, and temperature.

**********Supreme Court Stays Lokpal Order on Corruption Complaint Against High Court Judge
Why in News?
The Supreme Court recently stayed a
order that had taken cognizance of a corruption complaint against an unnamed High Court (HC) judge.
The Lokpal bench
, led by former SC judge A M Khanwilkar,
asserted its authority
to hear such cases under
the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013
However, the SC found this development
highly concerning and halted the proceedings
. The next hearing is scheduled for March 18.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Supreme Court's Rationale Behind Staying Lokpal Order
Legal Provisions on Complaints Against Judges
The Lokpal Case Against the HC Judge
Conclusion
Supreme Court's Rationale Behind Staying Lokpal Order:
Judicial independence:
The SC has always balanced criticism of judges with the need to safeguard judicial independence.
Concerns over executive overreach:
Since the Lokpal is
a statutory body
under the executive, allowing it to hear complaints against judges could set a precedent that
threatens judicial autonomy.
Precedence of established procedures:
The SC noted that accepting the Lokpal's ruling could
bypass
established procedures for investigating complaints against judges.
Legal Provisions on Complaints Against Judges:
Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS):
Section 77 of the IPC (1860) and Section 15 of the BNS (2023) provide that
a judge cannot be charged
with an offense for acts performed in the course of official duties.
K Veeraswami v Union of India (1991):
This landmark case ruled that
judges are public servants
can be investigated for corruption
under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (replaced by the new PCA enacted in 1988)
However, criminal proceedings against a judge
require Presidential sanction
, based on the
advice of the Chief Justice of India (CJI)
This safeguard aims to
prevent frivolous or politically motivated
Distinction from judicial impeachment:
The procedure for filing a case against a sitting judge is different from the procedure for impeaching a judge, where
approval is required from Parliament.
The Lokpal Case Against the HC Judge:
Allegations against the judge:
Two complaints
were filed against an HC judge for allegedly influencing judicial proceedings in suits involving a private company.
The complainant alleged that the company was the
judge’s former client
when he was an advocate.
The Lokpal order did not address the merits of the case but focused on
whether it had jurisdiction over an HC judge.
Interpretation of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013:
The Act applies to
within and outside India.
Section 14 defines public servants, but
does not explicitly include judges
However, sub-section (f) includes
officials from autonomous bodies
established by an Act of Parliament or controlled by the Central Government.
Differentiation between SC and HC judges:
In a separate case, the Lokpal ruled that it
cannot hear cases against SC judges
, as the SC was established under
Article 124
of the Constitution and not an Act of Parliament.
However, the Lokpal argued that HC judges fall under its jurisdiction since several High Courts were established under
the High Courts Act, 1861
, and
the Government of India Act, 1935
These, according to the General Clauses Act 1897, are considered Acts of Parliament.
Referral to the CJI:
Despite asserting its jurisdiction, the Lokpal recognized the need for caution, given the
K Veeraswami precedent
Before proceeding with an investigation, the Lokpal decided to refer the complaint to the CJI for guidance.
Conclusion:
The Supreme Court’s intervention underscores concern over
potential executive overreach
and the
protection of judicial independence
The case also highlights ongoing
legal ambiguities
regarding the jurisdiction of the Lokpal over the judiciary.
The SC’s final ruling will have significant implications for the accountability mechanisms of higher judiciary officials in India.

**********Trump 2.0 and the New Matrix of U.S.-India Defence Ties
Context
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s official visit to the United States
in February, 2025,
marked a significant step
in enhancing the
U.S.-India bilateral defence engagement.
The visit
resulted in agreements aimed at strengthening military cooperation
, including defence acquisitions and co-production initiatives.
However,
while these developments indicate progress, they also highlight existing challenges in defence procurement
, regulatory alignment, and technological integration.
Notable Achievements of PM Modi’s Visit
Strengthening Defence Acquisitions
One of the notable achievements of the visit was the
agreement to expand India's defence acquisitions and co-production efforts.
joint statement emphasised interoperability, particularly through India's planned purchase
and co-production of the ‘Javelin’ Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) and ‘Stryker’ Infantry Combat Vehicles (ICVs).
These initiatives are
expected to boost domestic manufacturing
and integrate India into the global supply chain for these systems.
Additionally,
India is set to acquire six more P-8I maritime patrol aircraft
to enhance the Indian Navy’s Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).
10 Year Framework for US-India Defence Partnership
A new 10-year framework for the U.S.-India Major Defence Partnership will
further consolidate military cooperation in advanced defence technologies.
In particular,
collaborations in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)
and autonomous systems received a significant push.
Agreements between companies such as Anduril Industries and the Mahindra Group
, as well as the
co-development of Active Towed Array Systems (ATAS) by L3Harris and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL),
highlight the
deepening defence industrial ties
between the two nations.
Greater Cooperation in Undersea Operations, Space Defence
The newly announced
Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA) is set to promote greater cooperation
in undersea systems, fifth-generation fighter aircraft, space defence, and anti-tank missile technology.
review of regulatory frameworks
related to arms transfers and the initiation of a Reciprocal Defence Procurement (RDP) agreement will ensure better synergy in defence trade and maintenance.
These developments
reflect a growing commitment to strategic collaboration
between India and the U.S.
Challenges in US-India Defence Collaboration
Delayed Technology Transfers and Engine Procurement Issues
One of the most pressing issues in U.S.-India defence collaboration is the
delay in the supply and transfer of technology (ToT)
General Electric’s fighter jet engines.
The joint statement following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit made
no mention of the urgent delivery of GE Aerospace’s F-404 GE-IN-20 engines
, which are crucial for the Tejas-Mark 1A fighter aircraft.
engines are essential for the operational readiness of India’s indigenous fighter jets,
yet delays in their procurement pose a serious setback for the Indian Air Force (IAF).
Challenges in Fighter Aircraft Procurement and Integration
potential integration of the F-35
Lightning II fighter aircraft into the IAF
presents a significant logistical and operational challenge.
Indian Air Force already operates a highly diverse fleet
, including Russian-origin Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, French Rafales, British Jaguars, and the indigenous Tejas jets.
Adding the F-35 to this mix would require extensive adjustments
in terms of training, maintenance, infrastructure, and weapons compatibility.
Moreover,
the IAF's Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) project,
which aimed to procure 114 multirole fighters, has faced
repeated delays since its initiation in 2000.
project has seen several changes
, from an initial selection of the Dassault Rafale in 2012 to later negotiations failing due to disagreements over technology transfer and costs.
Regulatory and Bureaucratic Hurdles in Defence Trade
While India and the U.S. have agreed to review their regulatory frameworks for arms transfers,
fundamental differences remain in defence procurement processes.
U.S. follows strict export control laws
, such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which can restrict India’s access to cutting-edge technology.
Even when deals are approved, they often come with conditions
that limit India’s ability to indigenously manufacture or modify the systems.
Although discussions are underway to establish an RDP agreement
, which would facilitate mutual supply of defence goods and services,
regulatory misalignments between India’s Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) and U.S. acquisition mechanisms
continue to slow progress.
process of acquiring American defence equipment often involves lengthy approvals
from both the U.S. Congress and India’s Ministry of Defence.
Bureaucratic delays on both sides have slowed down key defence projects,
such as the MH-60R Seahawk helicopters and armed Predator drones.
Dependence on Foreign Defence Supplies and Strategic Autonomy Concerns
While India has been expanding its partnerships with multiple nations, including Russia, France, Israel, and the U.S.,
its reliance on foreign defence imports raises concerns about strategic autonomy.
Unlike France, which agreed to provide some level of technology transfer for the Rafale deal,
the U.S. has historically been reluctant to share critical defence technology
with India.
The U
.S. tends to impose End-User Monitoring (EUM) agreements
, which require on-site inspections of military equipment even after sale. This could compromise India’s operational secrecy.
Acquiring U.S. systems like the F-35 or advanced missile defence systems may limit India’s ability to maintain a truly non-aligned defence policy
, as it would increase dependence on American military infrastructure and intelligence-sharing agreements.
Geopolitical Sensitivities and Russia’s Role in India’s Defence Strategy
India’s long-standing defence relationship with Russia
remains a factor that complicates deeper collaboration with the U.S.
For decades, Russia has been India’s primary supplier of military hardware,
including S-400 missile defence systems, Su-30MKI fighters, and nuclear submarines.
U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russia under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA),
which penalises countries that engage in defence deals with Moscow.
While India has so far managed to secure a waiver for its S-400 missile purchase,
future Russian defence deals could trigger U.S. restrictions.
Given Russia’s continued conflict with Ukraine and U.S. pressure on countries to reduce military cooperation with Moscow,
India faces a delicate balancing act in maintaining strong ties with both Russia and the U.S.
Implications of a U.S. Defence Deal
A potential deal with the U.S. for the F-35 would be
a major strategic move but comes with significant challenges.
Unlike the Rafale deal, which included advanced weapon systems such as the Scalp air-to-ground cruise missile and the Meteor air-to-air missile,
the F-35 purchase would likely lack technology transfer or co-production benefits.
the cost of maintaining a diverse fleet
, including the Rafale, Tejas, and potentially the F-35, would impose a
heavy logistical and financial burden
on the IAF.
Furthermore,
acquiring the F-35 could subject India to U.S. restrictions on its deployment and operations.
stringent on-site inspection regime that accompanies U.S. defence sales could limit India's strategic autonomy
in using the aircraft.
These concerns highlight the complexities
involved in making a long-term commitment to U.S. defence technology.
Conclusion
recent agreements between India and the U.S. demonstrate the deepening of their strategic and defence partnership
Increased interoperability, co-production, and regulatory alignment signal
progress in bilateral defence ties.
unresolved challenges,
including delays in engine deliveries for the Tejas, integration difficulties with the F-35, and complications surrounding the MMRCA project,
indicate that there is still work to be done.
While the Modi-Trump engagement has laid a foundation for stronger defence cooperation,
both nations must address these critical gaps to ensure that the partnership yields meaningful and sustainable results.

**********A Process Where Free and Fair Elections Will Be A Casualty
Context
The
Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023
is a landmark legislation that establishes a legal framework for the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners (ECs).
This
law was introduced in response to the Supreme Court of India's March 2023 directive
, which emphasised the need for an independent and transparent selection process.
However,
despite its intent to uphold democratic principles, the law has been met with considerable criticism
due to concerns about government influence in the appointment process.
Historical Context, Judicial Intervention and Challenges to the New Law
Historical Context and Judicial Intervention
Historically, the CEC and ECs were appointed solely by the President of India
based on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
system raised concerns about the impartiality of the Election Commission of India (ECI),
which is responsible for ensuring free and fair elections.
Recognising these concerns, the
Supreme Court ruled that the appointment process should involve a high-powered committee
consisting of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India (CJI).
arrangement was intended as an interim measure until Parliament enacted a law
on the subject.
While the
new Act adheres to the requirement of parliamentary legislation, it significantly alters the composition
of the selection committee.
Instead of including the CJI, the new Act introduces a cabinet minister
nominated by the Prime Minister.
change has raised serious constitutional and democratic concerns
regarding the independence of the selection process.
The primary objection to the new law is that
it deviates from the Supreme Court’s recommendation
by replacing the CJI with a cabinet minister.
alteration effectively ensures a government majority in the selection committee
, as both the Prime Minister and the cabinet minister are members of the ruling party.
As a result,
the appointment process risks becoming a mere formality
, with the government having the final say in selecting the CEC and ECs.
Furthermore,
the process involves a search committee led by the Law Minister
, which shortlists five candidates for consideration.
secrecy surrounding the shortlisted names adds another layer of opacity
to the process, potentially undermining public trust.
recent selection of the senior-most EC as the CEC by the two government-appointed members of the committee,
despite the LoP’s dissent, highlights
the predetermined nature of the selection process.
Constitutional Concerns and Infirmities in the Selection Process
The Constitution of India,
under Article 324, entrusts the Election Commission with the responsibility of conducting free and fair elections.
The Supreme Court, in
Election Commission of India vs. State of Tamil Nadu (1993), reaffirmed that the ECI must function independently
to preserve the integrity of the electoral process.
Given that India has nearly 960 million voters, the appointment of election commissioners must be devoid of political influence to maintain public confidence in the electoral system.
major flaw in the new Act lies in the composition of the selection committee.
By ensuring a built-in majority for the government,
the law undermines the fundamental principle of independent decision-making.
The inclusion of a cabinet minister, who is bound to align with the Prime Minister—prevents any genuine deliberation over the candidates' merits.
Unlike a truly independent committee where decisions emerge through debate,
the current structure makes the outcome predictable
in favour of the government’s preferred candidate.
Another significant issue is the Prime Minister’s power to nominate one of the members
, the cabinet minister.
Ideally,
the selection committee should consist of individuals capable of making independent and unbiased decisions.
a cabinet minister is inherently loyal to the Prime Ministe
r and is unlikely to oppose their decision.
This setup further reduces the scope for an objective evaluation of candidates.
Broader Implications of the Law: Violation of Constitutional Principles
arbitrary composition of the selection committee raises concerns about the new Act’s compatibility with Article 14
of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to equality.
By creating an appointment process that structurally favours government-backed candidates,
the law fails to establish a level playing field.
The fundamental principle of fairness in selecting high constitutional officers is compromised.
Additionally,
the independence of the ECI is crucial for ensuring free and fair elections,
a cornerstone of India’s democratic framework.
Supreme Court has repeatedly held that free and fair elections form part of the basic structure of the Constitution.
If the selection committee is biased in favour of the ruling party, it risks
eroding the credibility
of the electoral process, thereby
weakening democracy
The Role of the Supreme Court
Given these constitutional concerns,
it is imperative for the Supreme Court to critically examine the law.
judiciary has a duty to safeguard democratic institutions
and ensure that the ECI remains independent.
Court may need to reassess whether the current selection mechanism aligns with the constitutional principle
s of fairness, transparency, and non-partisanship.
One possible solution would be
to reinstate the CJI as a member of the selection committee to balance the decision-making process.
Alternatively,
Parliament could consider a more independent body,
possibly including retired judges or neutral experts, to oversee the appointments.
The Way Forward
To preserve the sanctity of India’s electoral system,
it is crucial that the appointment process be reformed to ensure fairness, transparency, and non-partisanship.
Supreme Court’s intervention will be crucial in determining whether this law aligns with constitutional values
or if it requires significant amendments to uphold the integrity of the electoral process.
Conclusion
The appointment of the CEC and ECs is a matter of national importance
, as it directly affects the conduct of elections and the legitimacy of the democratic process.
While the 2023 Act fulfils the requirement of a parliamentary law, its provisions compromise the independence of the ECI
by granting undue influence to the government in the selection process.
The inherent flaws in the Act,
including the lack of transparency, the government’s guaranteed majority in the selection committee, and the exclusion of the judiciary,
make it vulnerable to constitutional challenges.

**********Gautam Adani U.S. Indictment - Understanding Summons Issuance Under the Hague Convention
Why in news?
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) informed a New York court that it has sought India's assistance under the Hague Service Convention to serve summons on Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani.
The Adanis face criminal and civil charges from the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC for allegedly bribing Indian officials over $250 million to advance Adani Group’s solar projects.
What’s in today’s article?
SEC’s Legal Actions Against Adanis
India’s Accession and Reservations
Conditions for a Default Judgment Under the Hague Convention
The SEC informed a New York court that it had invoked Article 5(a) of the Hague Service Convention, requesting India’s Ministry of Law and Justice to facilitate summons delivery to Gautam and Sagar Adani.
The agency is also considering alternative service methods under Rule 4(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
FCPA Enforcement Paused by Trump Administration
Earlier, in February 2025, the Trump administration temporarily suspended enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days.
The FCPA prohibits U.S. entities and individuals from bribing foreign officials for business gains.
An executive order mandates a review of ongoing FCPA cases, but the SEC's court filing suggests the pause does not apply retroactively, allowing the Adani investigation to proceed.
The Hague Service Convention, signed in 1965, facilitates the cross-border exchange of legal documents, including summons, in commercial cases. India became a member in 2006.
It aims to ensure defendants in foreign jurisdictions receive timely and actual notice of legal proceedings.
Membership and Applicability
The Convention applies only when
both the sending and receiving countries are signatories
Currently, 84 states, including India and the U.S., are parties.
Each signatory must designate a central authority to handle service requests.
Permitted Channels of Communication
The Convention allows service through diplomatic channels (via the Ministry of External Affairs), postal services, and direct communication between judicial officers or legal representatives.
India joined the Hague Service Convention in November 2006, with reservations against all alternative service methods under Article 10.
India mandates that legal documents in cross-border commercial cases must be served indirectly through a designated authority rather than directly to the individuals involved.
MEA reiterates that private judicial officers cannot serve summons directly in India.
It prohibits the service of judicial documents through diplomatic or consular channels, except when the recipient is a national of the requesting country.
For instance, a U.S. court cannot serve documents in India through U.S. diplomatic or consular channels, unless the recipient is a U.S. national residing in India.
Additionally, all service requests must be in English or include an English translation.
Role of the Ministry of Law and Justice
The Ministry of Law and Justice serves as India’s designated central authority for processing service requests.
It can reject a request but must provide reasons, such as concerns over sovereignty or security under Article 13
However, it cannot refuse service solely based on claims of exclusive jurisdiction or differences in domestic law (Article 29).
A default judgment can be issued if a foreign government does not cooperate in serving summons on a defendant.
Article 15 of the Convention
sets specific conditions:
The summons must have been transmitted through an approved Convention method.
At least six months must have passed since transmission, and the court must deem this period reasonable.
No certificate of service has been received despite reasonable efforts through the competent authorities.
India’s Position on Default Judgments
India has explicitly stated that its courts may issue a default judgment in cross-border disputes even if no certificate of service is received, provided all Article 15 conditions are met.

Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on the
Election Commission of India (2017)
role of the Election Commission of India
(2022).
The Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Bill, 2023, is the first law made under Article 324(5) of the Constitution for appointing the CEC and ECs. It was introduced after the Supreme Court’s March 2023 order, which aimed to ensure fair appointments through a high-power committee.
Today’s editorial discusses about the selection process of Election commissioners which is currently in news. This content would help in GS Paper2 mains.

Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
The Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Bill is flawed because it favors the candidate chosen by the government.
What are the key provisions of the 2023 Bill for appointing?
Selection Committee Composition:
A three-member committee chaired by the
Prime Minister
, with the
Leader of Opposition (LoP)
in the Lok Sabha and a
Cabinet Minister
(nominated by the Prime Minister) as members.
Search Committee:
Headed by the

Appointment Procedure:
President
of India appoints the
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC)

mandatory
for the President to appoint candidates recommended by the
Why has the new law been challenged?
Deviation from Supreme Court’s Directive:

of the Supreme Court, headed by
Justice K.M. Joseph
, directed that appointments should be made by a
high-powered committee
comprising the

, reducing accountability.
Government’s Dominance:
The composition ensures a
built-in majority
government’s preferred candidate
, undermining
free and fair selection
What constitutional infirmities have been identified in the selection process?
Government-Controlled Majority in the Selection Committee:
The selection committee consists of the Prime Minister (Chairperson), a Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister, and the Leader of the Opposition (LoP).
This structure inherently creates a
2:1 majority in favor of the government
, allowing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Minister to dominate the decision-making process, undermining an independent and impartial selection.
Lack of Independent Oversight:
Replacing the Chief Justice of India (CJI) with a
weakens judicial oversight. This reduces
checks and balances
, as a Cabinet Minister is subordinate to the Prime Minister and unlikely to challenge the government’s preferences.
Violation of Fair and Objective Assessment:
The process does not ensure
objective evaluation
of candidates due to the predetermined government majority. This may violate
Article 14 (Right to Equality)
as it denies a fair chance to qualified candidates outside the government’s favor and threatens the
basic structure doctrine
by compromising the independence of the Election Commission.
What are the key observations of the Supreme Court?
Independence of the Election Commission is Vital:
The Supreme Court emphasized that the
Election Commission of India (ECI)
must be
, which is a
fundamental feature
of democracy.
Example:
In the
Election Commission of India vs. State of Tamil Nadu (1993)
, the Court held that the ECI has
plenary powers
to conduct free and fair elections, reinforcing the need for
independent appointments
Need for a Neutral Selection Process:
The Court highlighted that appointments to constitutional bodies like the ECI should be made through a
neutral and independent process
to prevent executive dominance.
, the Constitution Bench directed that, until a law is enacted, the
Prime Minister, LoP, and the CJI
should select the CEC and ECs to ensure
balanced decision-making
Concerns over Executive Overreach:
The Court warned that allowing the
executive to control
appointments could undermine the
institution’s autonomy
and jeopardize the
integrity
of the electoral process.
The Court observed that the historical practice of
Prime Minister-led
appointments was
unsatisfactory
, as it compromised the Commission’s
Violation of Article 14 (Right to Equality):
The Court observed that a selection process favoring the government could violate

The current law creates a

Upholding the Basic Structure Doctrine:
The Court reiterated that

Way forward:
Restore Judicial Oversight
: Reintroduce the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in the selection committee to ensure impartiality and independent oversight.
Enhance Transparency

Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of delimitation exercise;
Why in the News?
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has called for an all-party meeting on March 5 to discuss the delimitation exercise, aiming to start a national discussion on the issue.
What is the primary concern of Tamil Nadu regarding the delimitation exercise?
Loss of Parliamentary Representation:
Tamil Nadu fears that if
is based solely on population size, it may lose
Lok Sabha seats
due to its
lower population growth
compared to northern States. For instance, while
Tamil Nadu’s electorate grew by 171% (1971-2024)
undivided Bihar’s grew by 233%
, which could lead to a reduction in Tamil Nadu’s political influence.
Penalty for Population Control Success:
Tamil Nadu is concerned that its
effective population control measures
will be penalized. States with
higher fertility rates
(e.g.,
Uttar Pradesh, Bihar
) might gain seats, while those with
lower growth
like Tamil Nadu and
Kerala
could lose out, despite their better
health and development indicators
What are the potential impacts of the delimitation exercise?
Shift in Political Power Dynamics:
Delimitation could increase the number of representatives from
with higher populations (e.g.,
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
), thereby shifting political influence away from
southern and western
States that have implemented effective population control measures.
Federal Imbalance and Regional Inequality:
Southern states that perform better in terms of
health, education, and population control
may feel penalized. For example,
Kerala’s
successful population policies could lead to fewer seats despite its contributions to national development, undermining the principle of
cooperative federalism
Resource Allocation Disparities:
More seats for northern States could lead to greater influence over
Union Budget allocations
central schemes
, potentially reducing the share of resources to States with fewer representatives like
Karnataka
Andhra Pradesh
Political Tensions and Regional Discontent:
Perceived favoritism towards northern States could increase
regional tensions
. For example, Tamil Nadu’s call for an
reflects concerns that their voices will be marginalized, which may fuel
political agitation
and demands for policy reassessment.
Why was the delimitation exercise frozen based on the 1971 Census?
To Ensure Fairness Among States with Varying Population Growth:
This aimed to protect the
political representation
of States that successfully implemented
population control policies
Example:
Southern States like
have lower population growth but would lose seats if delimitation were updated, while
would gain due to their higher population increases.
To Maintain the Balance of Power in Federal Governance:
The freeze ensured that the
distribution of parliamentary seats
did not disrupt the
federal structure
by over-representing certain regions. This preserved a
geographical balance
in national decision-making.
Despite
slower population growth, its
39 Lok Sabha seats
remain unchanged since 1971, allowing it to maintain a significant voice in national policies.
What steps has the Union government taken to clarify its position on maintaining proportional representation for Southern States?
Delimitation Freeze Extension
: The government extended the freeze on parliamentary seat allocation based on population through the
42nd Amendment (1976)
until
2001
, and later extended it to
2026
84th Amendment (2001)
Equitable Resource Allocation
15th Finance Commission (2021-26)
used a balanced approach by including both

to ensure fair distribution of resources, addressing concerns of Southern states.
: The Commission allocated
12.5% weightage
for demographic performance, rewarding states with better population control.
Consultative Processes
: The Union government engages with Southern states through
inter-state council meetings
Finance Commission consultations
to address their concerns about fair representation and resource distribution.
: In
2023
, the government held deliberations on the implications of delimitation and reassured Southern states of equitable consideration in future seat revisions.
Way forward:
Balanced Delimitation Framework:
Implement a
hybrid approach
that considers both
to ensure fair representation without penalizing states with successful population control policies.
Strengthen Federal Dialogue:

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Hague Service Convention;
Why in the News?
On February 18, 2025, the U.S. Secuirty and Exchange commission asked the Indian government under the Hague Service Convention, to serve summons on Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani in a securities and wire fraud case.
What is the Hague Service Convention?
, formally known as the
Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters (1965)
, is a
multilateral treaty
that facilitates the
service of legal documents
across international borders in civil and commercial cases.
How does it work?
standardizes the process for serving legal documents across borders in
matters. It operates through
Central Authorities
in member countries, ensuring
efficient service
, protecting
defendants’ rights
, and allowing
alternative methods
like postal service if permitted. It excludes
criminal cases
and non-signatory nations.
How is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission attempting to serve summons on the Adanis?
Invoking the Hague Service Convention:
The SEC has requested assistance from
India’s Ministry of Law and Justice
Article 5(a)
of the
to officially deliver the summons to
Exploring Alternative Service Methods:
The SEC is considering
Rule 4(f) of the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
, which allows service through means like
email
social media
, if conventional methods face delays.
Proceeding Despite FCPA Suspension:
Although the
Trump administration
has temporarily paused the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)
enforcement for 180 days, the SEC argues that the pause does
not apply retroactively
, allowing their
investigation into the Adanis
to continue.
What are India’s reservations under the Convention?
Opposition to Alternative Service Methods:
rejects
alternative service methods
Article 10
of the Convention, including
postal service, diplomatic channels
direct service
by foreign judicial officers.
Example:
U.S. court
cannot serve legal documents in
via
U.S. consular channels
unless the recipient is a
U.S. national
residing in India.
Mandatory Use of Central Authority:
All service requests must go through
, which is the
designated central authority
for processing foreign summons. Requests must be in
English
or include an
English translation
Punjab National Bank (International) Ltd. v. Boris Shipping Ltd. (2019)
U.K. court
ruled that service through
was
invalid
due to India’s reservations.
How long does the service process typically take?
The service process under the Hague Service Convention in India typically takes
six to eight months
. After receiving a request,
verifies and forwards it to the appropriate authority. Upon completion, an
acknowledgement
is issued to the requesting country, confirming successful service.
Way forward:
Expedite Processing Mechanisms:
Implement digital tracking and streamlined workflows within the Ministry of Law and Justice to reduce delays in handling service requests.
Strengthen Bilateral Cooperation:
Enhance legal cooperation with key countries through bilateral agreements to complement the Hague Service Convention and facilitate faster document service.
