What is CSR?
About:
Corporate Social Responsibility
in general can be referred to as a corporate initiative to assess and take responsibility for the company's effects on the environment and impact on social welfare.
It is a self-regulating business model
that helps a
company to be socially accountable
. By practising corporate social responsibility,
companies can be conscious of the impact they are having on economic, social, and environmental factors
India is the
first country to mandate CSR spending
under clause 135 of the
Companies Act, 2013
, with a framework for identifying potential CSR activities.
Unlike India,
most countries have voluntary CSR frameworks.
Norway and Sweden, which have moved to mandatory CSR provisions, began with voluntary models.

CSR provisions apply to companies meeting any of the following criteria in the preceding financial year.
Net worth over Rs. 500 crore
Turnover over Rs. 1000 crore
Net profit over Rs. 5 crore.
Such companies must spend
at least 2% of their average net profits
from the last three financial years on CSR activities, or if newly incorporated, based on the average net profits from preceding financial years.

What are the Issues Pertaining to CSR Compliance?
Geographical Disparity in CSR Spending:
Spending is
concentrated in industrial states like Maharashtra (5375cr.)
, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, while North Eastern states
(Mizoram 6.9 cr)
and Lakshadweep, Leh and
Ladakh receive comparatively less funding, reflecting a regional imbalance.
CSR Allocation Trends:
MCA
data reveals that nearly
75% of CSR funds are concentrated in three sectors: education, health
(including
sanitation and water
and rural poverty.
Sectors related to Livelihood enhancement (Rs 1,654 cr) have very less spending.
PSU vs Non-PSU Spending: Non-PSUs contribute 84% of total CSR spending,
while PSUs account for the remaining 16%, highlighting a significant difference in CSR expenditure between the two sectors.
Strategic Misalignment in CSR:
Many companies have
merged sustainability with business strategies, prioritising profit margins over genuine
social impact, thus undermining the true purpose of CSR.
Finding Right Partners:
Despite growing awareness about the significance of CSR compliance, the challenges remain in identifying the
right partners as well as in selecting projects that are long-term impactful, scalable, and are self-sustaining.
Issues of Transparency:
There is an expression by the companies that there exists lack of
transparency on the part of the local implementing agencies
as they do not make adequate efforts to disclose information on their programs, audit issues, impact assessment and utilisation of funds.
What are the Ways to Enhance the Effectiveness of CSR Expenditure?
Enhancing CSR Engagement and Oversight:
Aligning CSR with local government programs like the
ADP(Aspirational Districts Programme)
can boost community participation and engagement, while the
government should ensure effective CSR implementation,
leverage AI for better oversight.
NGOs can work along with companies in remote and rural areas to ensure successful implementation of CSR activities.
Address Sectoral and Geographical Disparity:
Need to Invest in
higher education
high impact technological and environment friendly projects
that focus on skill development and livelihood enhancement.
Develop CSR
programs for underserved regions, offer incentives for spending in less-funded areas or make a mandatory provision to address regional disparity in spending
, and collaborate with local
PSU vs Non-PSU Spending Disparity:
Encourage
to increase contributions, implement benchmarking, and
promote joint CSR initiatives between PSUs and non-PSUs.
Company Roles and Governance:
Conduct regular reviews, set clear objectives, and update governance roles. Establish new SOPs for fund utilisation, impact assessments, and detailed checklists.
Conclusion
To maximize the impact of CSR,
companies must move beyond mere compliance and embrace strategic alignment
with local government programs,
address sectoral and regional disparities,
and ensure transparency and accountability.
fostering stronger collaborations between PSUs and non-PSUs
and investing in innovative, scalable projects,
CSR can drive sustainable social change and contribute to Indiaâ€™s long-term socio-economic development.
