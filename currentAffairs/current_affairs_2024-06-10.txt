Agnipath scheme and its opposition
Why in news?
Agnipath scheme, announced in June 2022, has faced opposition from political parties and Armed Forces veterans.
The opposition's campaign in states like Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan, where the Armed Forces are a major employer, prominently featured criticism to this military recruitment scheme. The BJP's performance in these states suggests that this opposition resonated with voters.
With the BJP now falling short of a majority in the Lok Sabha, key alliance partners like Janata Dal (United) and Lok Janshakti Party have also called for a review of the scheme.
What’s in today’s article?
Why was Agnipath introduced?
Why has Agnipath seen such strong opposition?
About
It is a central government scheme launched in 2022 for recruitment to the armed forces.
It is a recruitment process for individuals
below the rank of officer
, with the goal of deploying fitter, younger troops on the front lines, many
of whom will be on four-year contracts
The armed forces would also have the option to retain some of the best 'Agniveers.'
Eligibility
Candidates between the age of 17.5 years to 21 years will be eligible for enrolling in the Agnipath scheme.
Girls under the given age limit are open for the agnipath entry, while there is
no such reservation for women under this scheme
The recruitment standards will remain the same, and recruitment will be done twice a year through rallies.
Pay & Benefits of Agniveers
If they die on duty, their family receives a lump sum of Rs 1 crore (including the Seva Nidhi package, and full pay for the period which the soldier could not serve).
In case of disability, an Agniveer can receive upto Rs 44 lakh as compensation, depending on the percentage of disability suffered which is attributed to, or aggravated by military service.
Agnipathis different from regular military service
Unlike soldiers in regular service, Agniveers do not draw pensions post-retirement.
Only 25% of Agniveers who are absorbed into the forces after four years will receive pension benefits, excluding their initial four years of service.
This scheme aims to reduce the Armed Forces’ permanent force levels and significantly cut the defence pension bill, a longstanding concern for governments.
Agniveers recruited so far
In the Army, two batches of 40,000 Agniveers have completed training and are under posting.
The third batch of 20,000 began training in November 2023.
In the Navy, three batches of 7,385 Agniveers have completed training. In the IAF, 4,955 Agniveers have completed training.
The Agnipath scheme, beyond reducing the Armed Forces’ wage and pension bill, aims to ensure a
youthful profile for the forces
Defence Minister described the scheme as a game changer, intended to make the Armed Forces youthful, high-tech, and ultra-modern.
The average age in the Armed Forces, currently 32 years, will be reduced to 26 years with Agnipath's implementation.
The government also argues that Agniveers, after completing their service, will positively contribute to civil society with their skills, discipline, and education.
This is expected to enhance workforce quality, productivity, and overall GDP growth.
Critics argue that the Agnipath scheme creates a lesser cadre of soldiers who perform the same tasks as fully commissioned soldiers but with lower pay, fewer benefits, and limited prospects.
Recently, an opposition leader wrote to President, highlighting the discrimination in benefits for the families of fallen Agniveers compared to regular soldiers, calling for urgent attention to this issue.
This disparity has caused significant dissatisfaction among those who view military recruitment as a means to economic stability and upward mobility.

**********Arbitration in India
Why in the News?
The Union Finance Ministry has recommended restricting arbitration clauses in government contracts to disputes of less than ₹10 crore.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Arbitration (Meaning, Types, Laws in India, etc.)
News Summary
What is Arbitration?
Arbitration is a mechanism for resolving disputes between investors and brokers, or between brokers.
It is overseen by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the decisions are final and binding.
Arbitration is distinct from mediation, in which parties negotiate to reach a voluntary settlement, and decisions are not binding unless all parties agree to them.
Arbitration is not the same as filing an investor complaint, in which an investor alleges wrongdoing on the part of a broker, but has no specific dispute with that broker, for which the investor seeks damages.
Types of Arbitration:
There are many types of arbitration. Some of the major types of arbitration include:
Commercial Arbitration
Definition
: Used to resolve disputes arising from commercial contracts or transactions.
Common Areas
: Business disputes, breach of contract, partnership disputes.
International Arbitration
: Involves parties from different countries and is often used in international commercial and investment disputes.
Institutions
: Conducted under rules of institutions like the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) or the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA).
Domestic Arbitration
: Takes place within a single country and involves parties from the same jurisdiction.
: Local business disputes, real estate conflicts, employment disputes.
Ad hoc Arbitration
: Conducted independently by the parties without the involvement of an institution, using rules agreed upon by the parties or established by the arbitrator.
Flexibility
: Offers more flexibility but requires the parties to handle administrative tasks.
Consumer Arbitration
: Resolves disputes between consumers and businesses, often based on arbitration clauses in consumer contracts.
Focus
: Aims to provide a faster and less expensive resolution compared to court litigation.
Arbitration Laws in India:
Arbitration in India is governed by a robust legal framework aimed at facilitating fair and efficient resolution of disputes.
The primary legislation governing arbitration in India is the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
The Act incorporates provisions from the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.
Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021
is the latest amendment to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
Unconditional Stay on Awards
: Provided for an automatic stay on enforcement of arbitral awards if the arbitration agreement or contract is prima facie fraudulent or corrupt.
Qualifications of Arbitrators
: Specified qualifications and experience required for arbitrators to ensure quality and competence.
Several institutions provide arbitration services in India, including:
Indian Council of Arbitration (ICA)
International Centre for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ICADR)
Mumbai Centre for International Arbitration (MCIA)
Delhi International Arbitration Centre (DIAC)
Recent recommendation by the Finance Ministry regarding arbitration:
In order to streamline arbitration process to resolve commercial dispute having government or PSE is one party,
Finance Ministry has set an upper limit of ₹10 crore for cases to be brought in
It has also said that arbitration clause should not be automatically included in large contracts.
The Ministry has accepted that the
arbitration processes are expensive and time-consuming
, and that there are perceptions of wrong-doing including collusion about arbitrators.
All the government entities have been advised to avoid amicably settle as many disputes as possible using mechanisms available in the contract.
Decisions should be taken in a pragmatic manner in overall long-term public interest, keeping legal and practical realities in view.
High Level Committee to Resolve High Value Cases:
The guidelines also call for setting up a High Level Committee to resolve high value cases.
The committee should have a retired judge and a retired top official or technical expert.
ln cases where a HLC is constituted, effort should be negotiate directly with the other party and place a tentative proposed solution before the HLC.
Alternatively the committee can also be used as mediator.
Judiciary’s Opinion on Arbitration:
The Finance Ministry’s recommendations come even as
there is an increased push from the judiciary in favour of arbitration and to make India one of the top international destinations for commercial arbitration
Arbitration is no longer an alternative, Chief Justice of India Chandrachud had said addressing the United Kingdom Supreme Court on June 6. It is in fact the preferred method of seeking commercial justice, he had said.
He said it was time for countries like India to create and promote a culture of commercial arbitration.

**********Issues Faced by the AP Post-Bifurcation
Why in News?
Several issues relating to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2014 (APRA) remain pending between the two successor states - Telangana and AP, ten years after their bifurcation.
Political analyses of the TDP's kingmaker role in the NDA have focused on Chandrababu Naidu's years-long efforts to secure AP's Special Category Status.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What Needs to be Done?
Issues Faced by the AP Post-Bifurcation:
State without a capital:
According to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2014,
Hyderabad would be the common capital
of AP and Telangana until June 2, 2024.
While a few office spaces, an interim Secretariat, and a High Court have been established,
successive governments have not been able to make Amaravati the capital.
State has not made rapid strides in terms of economic development:
The economy of the State has not improved compared to States such as Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Apart from Kia Motors in Anantapur, reportedly no other major players have ventured into Andhra Pradesh.
Major projects remain unrealised dreams:
Major projects such as the
Polavaram
project, the Kadapa Steel Plant, and the South Coast Railway Zone in Visakhapatnam are delayed as they are
not technically and economically feasible.
High revenue deficit:
The Reorganisation Act mandated the Union government to lend support to AP for its resource gap for 2014-15.
The revenue deficit was estimated by the State government at ₹16,078 crore, however it was reduced to ₹3,979.50 crore by the Union government.
The revenue deficit touched ₹31,479.88 crore by March 2024
(preliminary estimates).
Unresolved issues AP and Telangana:
The division of various institutions and corporations
, listed in the Reorganisation Act, has not been completed due to a lack of consensus.
Assets belonging
to nearly 245 institutions (worth about ₹1.42 lakh crore) mentioned in the Reorganisation Act, are yet to be divided between the two States.
The people of AP attached to Hyderabad emotionally and economically:
The people of Andhra continue to rely on Hyderabad for health and educational facilities.
Policymakers and bureaucrats are not in Hyderabad, but they are still connected to the city emotionally.
This could be one of the reasons for the tardy progress in Andhra Pradesh.
Establishing a capital in the State:
The YSRCP put forth the idea of three capitals, but this may not be easy and may run into legal issues.
Similarly, a grandiose capital, as planned by the TDP, will have fiscal problems if the various welfare schemes promised in the manifestos are implemented.
To win investors’ confidence,
the government has to develop a capital with the resources it has now.
The development of infrastructural facilities:
This will give a big boost to the industry and service sector. As the Union government is
prioritising port-led development
, AP can look for a bigger share in the pie given its coastal advantage.
Pending issues with Telangana need to be resolved:
Telangana must pay ₹6,756 crore to AP for the supply of power post-bifurcation (from June 2, 2014, to June 10, 2017).
The river management boards
which were supposed to be set up in AP should be shifted to the State from Hyderabad.
Courts must adjudicate pending disputes
, which includes division of the AP State FinancialCorporation’s assets, sharing of Krishna and Godavari waters, etc.,
on a priority basis
Discussion on Special Category Status to AP:
This would make up for the revenue losses incurred by the AP following the split of the united state in 2014.

**********First Past The Post System Vs. Proportional Representation
Why in news?
The results of the Lok Sabha elections were declared on June 4. The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has won 293 seats with a 43.3% vote share while the Opposition bloc INDIA has secured 234 seats with a 41.6% vote share. Other regional parties and independents received about 15% of the votes but only won 16 seats in total. As a result, many experts are now advocating for India to switch to a proportional representation system.
What’s in today’s article?
First Past the Post (FPTP) system
Proportional representation
Prevailing international practices
Way forward
About
The FPTP system, also known as the simple majority voting system, is an electoral method where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the election.
This system is widely used in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and India for legislative elections.
Working
Single-Member Districts
- Each constituency elects one representative.
Plurality Wins
- The candidate who receives the highest number of votes wins, regardless of whether they achieve an absolute majority (more than 50% of the votes).
Advantages
Disadvantages
Simplicity
Easy for voters to understand and participate in.
Straightforward counting process.
Strong and Stable Governments
Often produces a clear winner, which can lead to strong and stable governments.
Under this system, the ruling party/coalition can enjoy a majority in the Lok Sabha/Legislative assembly without obtaining majority of the votes (more than 50%) across constituencies. This increases stability of the govt.
Direct Representation
Provides direct representation of constituencies, ensuring that each geographic area has a dedicated representative.
Accountability
Representatives are directly accountable to their constituents, as they can be easily voted out in the next election if they do not perform well.
Disproportionality
Can lead to a significant mismatch between the percentage of votes received and the percentage of seats won.
Smaller parties may be underrepresented, while larger parties may receive a disproportionate number of seats.
Wasted Votes
Votes for losing candidates do not contribute to the overall election result, which can discourage voter participation.
Can lead to strategic voting, where voters choose not their preferred candidate, but the one they think has the best chance of winning.
Minority Rule
A candidate can win with a minority of the votes if the opposition is divided among multiple candidates.
This can result in a government that does not reflect the majority preference of the electorate.
Geographic Concentration
Parties with geographically concentrated support can win more seats than parties with evenly distributed support, even if they receive fewer overall votes.
Encourages Gerrymandering
The system can incentivize the
drawing of constituency boundaries
to favor one party over another, known as gerrymandering.
Proportional Representation (PR)
PR is an electoral system designed to allocate seats in the legislature in proportion to the number of votes each party receives.
This system contrasts with the First Past the Post (FPTP) system, where the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins.
PR aims to create a
more accurate reflection of the voters' preferences
across the entire electorate.
Party Lists
- Voters typically cast their vote for a party rather than an individual candidate.
The party then allocates seats to candidates from their list based on the proportion of votes received.
Multi-Member Districts
- Each district elects multiple representatives, which allows for proportional allocation.
Thresholds
- Often, a minimum percentage of votes (threshold) is required for a party to gain representation, to prevent excessive fragmentation.
Types of Proportional Representation:
List PR
- Voters choose a party, and parties receive seats based on their share of the vote. Seats are filled by candidates from the party’s list.
Mixed-Member PR
- Combines elements of FPTP and PR. Voters cast two votes: one for a candidate and one for a party.
Some seats are filled by individual candidates, while others are allocated to parties based on their share of the vote.
Single Transferable Vote (STV)
- Voters rank candidates in order of preference.
Seats are allocated based on the proportion of votes each candidate receives, with surplus votes and eliminated candidates' votes transferred according to voter preferences.
Advantages of PR
Disadvantages of PR
Fair Representation:
Parties receive seats in proportion to their share of the vote, leading to a more accurate reflection of electorate's preferences.
Minority Inclusion:
Smaller parties and minority groups have a better chance of gaining representation, promoting diversity in the legislature.
Reduced Wasted Votes:
Fewer votes are wasted as most votes contribute to the election of a candidate, increasing voter satisfaction and participation.
Encourages Voter Turnout:
Voters may feel their vote has more impact
Coalition Governments:
While coalitions can be a strength, they can also lead to unstable governments if coalition partners frequently disagree, resulting in inefficiency or frequent elections.
Complexity:
PR systems can be more complex for voters to understand and for electoral authorities to administer compared to simpler systems like FPTP.
Fragmentation:
Can lead to a fragmented legislature with many small parties, making it difficult to achieve a majority consensus.
Weaker Constituency Links:
Representatives may be less accountable to specific geographic constituencies since they are elected on a party list basis rather than as individuals.
Influence of Party Leadership:
Party leaders often have significant control over candidate lists, which can centralize power within the party and reduce individual accountability of representatives.
What are international practices?
Presidential Democracies like Brazil and Argentina
: Party list Proportional Representation (PR) system.
Parliamentary democracies like South Africa, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain
: Also use the party list PR system.
Germany: Bundestag Structure
Out of 598 seats, 299 seats (50%) are filled from constituencies under the First Past the Post (FPTP) system.
The remaining 299 seats (50%) are allocated to parties that secure at least 5% of the votes, based on their vote share.
New Zealand: House of Representatives Structure
Out of 120 seats, 60% are filled through the FPTP system from territorial constituencies.
The remaining 40% are distributed among parties that secure at least 5% of the votes, based on their vote share.
Way forward for India
Law Commission's Recommendation (170
report, 1999)
The Law Commission in its report, ‘Reform of the electoral laws’, recommended the introduction of the
Mixed-Member Proportional Representation (MMPR)
system on an experimental basis.
It suggested that 25% of seats could be filled through a PR system by
increasing the strength of the Lok Sabha.
Upcoming Delimitation Exercise and associated challenges
A delimitation exercise to increase the number of Lok Sabha seats is due after the first Census conducted post-2026.
The population growth in the last five decades has been uneven across regions.
Determining the number of seats in proportion to population alone may conflict with federal principles
It could lead to disenchantment in States that might lose representation through such a method.
Way out through MMPR System
Introducing the MMPR system for
incremental seats or at least 25%
of the total seats from each State/UT during the delimitation exercise could balance representation.
This approach could mitigate concerns of southern, northeastern, and smaller northern States by preventing domination of larger States solely through the FPTP system.

**********IRDAI’s new health insurance rules   
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
IRDAI and its composition
Mains level:
The recent rules highlighted by IRDAI
Why in the news?
Recently, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) introduced a set of reforms in the health insurance sector aimed at significantly enhancing service standards for policyholders.
The recent rules highlighted by IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) include:
Cashless processing:
Insurers are mandated to accept or reject cashless claims immediately, within one hour, and settle such claims on discharge within three hours. Any delay beyond this period would result in the insurer bearing the additional costs, if any.
Claim settlement:
Insurers cannot repudiate a claim without the approval of their claims review panel. Documents for claim settlement must be collected from hospitals or third-party administrators, not from the insured.
Policyholders with multiple health policies:
They can select the policy under which they want to make a claim, with the primary insurer coordinating the settlement of the balance amount from other insurers.
Reward for No claims:
Policyholders with no claims during the policy period may receive either an increased sum insured or discounted premium amounts.
Renewal policies:
All individual health policies are renewable and cannot be denied based on previous claims, except in cases of fraud, non-disclosures, or misrepresentation. No fresh underwriting is required for renewal policies unless there is an increase in the sum insured.
Portability requests:
Stricter timelines are imposed on portability requests via the Insurance Information Bureau of India portal.
Customer information sheet:
Insurers are required to include a customer information sheet as part of the policy document, explaining all customer-facing details such as policy type, sum assured, coverage details, exclusions, deductibles, and waiting periods.
Challenges related to health insurance in India
Opaque Policy Details and Claim Processes:
Policyholders often struggle to understand the intricacies of insurance contracts, leading to uncertainty about coverage entitlements and reimbursement procedures.
Claim Rejections:
Policyholders frequently face claim rejections due to inadequate documentation and ambiguous claims processes.
Delays in Claim Settlement:
Insurance companies often take a long time to process claims, causing inconvenience and financial stress for policyholders
IRDAI and its composition:
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) is the
regulatory body
overseeing the insurance sector in India. It was constituted under the
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999
The composition of IRDAI typically includes a Chairman and members appointed by the Government of India. The authority regulates various aspects of insurance, including licensing, pricing, and policyholder protection, to ensure the stability and growth of the insurance industry while safeguarding the interests of policyholders.
Conclusion:
IRDAI’s recent health insurance reforms aim to improve service standards by mandating timely cashless claim processing, transparent claim settlement, and policyholder rewards for no claims. These changes address challenges like opaque policies and claim rejections, enhancing customer trust. IRDAI plays a vital role in ensuring a fair and efficient insurance sector.

Mains level:
Trade disputes; India and USA at the WTO
Why in the News?
In March, India and the U.S. settled their last lingering WTO poultry dispute, marking the end of seven trade disputes resolved since Prime Minister Modi’s U.S. visit.
What is ‘Litigotiation’?
‘Litigotiation’ is a blend of “litigation” and “negotiation,” referring to a strategic process where legal disputes are managed through a combination of
courtroom litigation
and settlement
negotiations
This approach recognizes that most legal disputes do not end with a court verdict but rather with a negotiated settlement reached during the litigation process.
Trade dispute on poultry products between India and USA at the WTO
Indian Scenario
: India had
prohibited the import of various agricultural products
from the US because of concerns related to Avian Influenza.
U.S. argued
: The U.S. challenged India’s import restrictions on poultry products, which were imposed due to concerns about
avian influenza (bird flu)
potentially transmitting to humans.
It argued that India deviated from internationally recognized standards that were set by the
World Organization for Animal Health
(formerly OIE) and failed to provide scientific justifications for its measures, violating the
WTO’s Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement
The dispute was initiated by the U.S. in 2012 and remained unresolved for over a decade, making it the oldest of the seven trade disputes between India and the U.S. In 2015, India lost a long-pending dispute over poultry imports from the US at the WTO.
The recent settlement allowed India to avoid a
yearly $450 million claim
In exchange, India agreed to reduce tariffs on select U.S. products such as
cranberries, blueberries, frozen turkey,
premium frozen duck meat
, marking a significant diplomatic breakthrough.
What are the standards set by the World Organization for Animal Health?
The Terrestrial Animal Health Code
First published in
1968,
provides standards for the improvement of terrestrial animal health and welfare and veterinary public health worldwide.
These standards should be used by
Veterinary Services to set up measures
for the early detection, reporting, and control of pathogenic agents, including zoonotic agents, and
preventing their spread
The Aquatic Animal Health Code
Introduced in 1995, provides standards for the improvement of aquatic animal health and welfare worldwide.
Aquatic Animal Health Services to set up measures
for the prevention, early detection, reporting, and control of pathogenic agents in aquatic animals (amphibians, crustaceans, fish, and mollusks).
Implementation of the recommendations in the
Aquatic Code
ensures the safety of
international trade in aquatic animals

About WTO:
World Trade Organization (WTO)
is an
intergovernmental organization
that regulates and
facilitates international trade
among its member nations. It was established in 1995 and has 164 member countries, representing over 98% of global trade and global GDP.
Conclusion:
The India-U.S. settlement underscores the power of diplomatic negotiations in resolving complex trade disputes, fostering stronger bilateral ties, and promoting a more stable and cooperative international trade environment.

This week, the
Third Glasgow Dialogue
Loss and Damage
occurred during the 60th Session of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB60)
to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
in Bonn, Germany.
Key highlights of the Conference:
Dialogue on Loss and Damage (L&D):
The conference focused on discussions around the mechanisms under the UNFCCC, including the
Santiago Network on Loss and Damage (SNLD)
Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM)
, and the recently operationalized
Loss and Damage Fund (LDF).
was established at COP25 in 2019 to catalyze technical assistance for developing countries in implementing approaches for averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage
was established at COP19 in 2013 to promote approaches for averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage associated with climate change impacts
was operationalized at COP27 in 2022 to provide financial support to developing countries for averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage
Progress in Mechanisms:
The co-chairs of each mechanism highlighted the progress made in addressing L&D in the UNFCCC negotiations. This includes positive steps taken in forming the Board of the LDF and formalizing its institutional arrangements and additional rules.
Global South Concerns:
Countries from the Global South, including the
African Group of Negotiators (AGN),
Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)
Arab Group
, emphasized the growing cases of L&D in developing nations. There were calls for better cooperation and coordination between countries and mechanisms to address L&D more effectively.
African Group of Negotiators (AGN):
It is a coalition of African countries that work together to coordinate their positions and negotiate on various international issues, such as climate change, sustainable development, and human rights.
Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS):
It is a coalition of small island developing states that work together to address common challenges and promote their interests in international forums.
Arab Group:
It is a coalition of Arab states that work together to promote their collective interests and coordinate their positions on various international issues.
Need for Clarity and Coordination:
There were calls for a clear relationship between the SNLD, WIM, and LDF, as they each continue to have separate discussions despite having the same goal of addressing L&D. Coordination between these mechanisms would address gaps and improve resource mobilization for developing nations.
About Article 6 and its structural mandate:
Article 6 of the UNFCCC
deals with cooperative approaches for the implementation of climate action. It provides a framework for international cooperation in areas such as emissions trading, sustainable development, and the transfer of mitigation outcomes.
The structural mandate
of Article 6 aims to facilitate cooperation between countries to enhance climate action and achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Key Goals and Objectives:
Raised Ambition:
International cooperation under Article 6 aims to raise ambition by enabling countries to achieve more ambitious emission reduction targets.
Supporting Sustainable Development:
The cooperation mechanisms must support sustainable development, addressing not only climate change but also other sustainability issues.
Ensuring Environmental Integrity:
The mechanisms must ensure environmental integrity by preventing emission reductions from being counted more than once and ensuring that countries do not circumvent their climate action efforts
Way Forward:
There is a need for clarity on the framework of L&D as a whole, with a defined relationship between its key mechanisms. This would ensure better coordination and cooperation in addressing L&D effectively.
Enhanced Technical Interventions:
Countries emphasized the importance of technical interventions such as Early Warning Systems and timely provision of finance to improve responses to L&D. Implementing these interventions could minimize the impacts of extreme weather events and facilitate faster recovery.
Tailored Responses:
Responses to L&D must be tailored to the unique contexts of each country, with individual vulnerability and needs assessments being a priority. This would ensure that assistance and support are provided where they are most needed.
Trigger-based Funding Mechanisms:
Suggestions were made for trigger-based funding mechanisms or timeline-based provision of funds for countries facing devastating impacts and remaining most vulnerable. Such mechanisms would ensure timely and adequate support for those in need.
Mains PYQ:
Explain the purpose of the Green Grid Initiative launched at the World Leaders Summit of the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November 2021. When was this idea first floated in the International Solar Alliance (ISA)?

First Past the Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) System
Mains level:
Pros and Cons of FPTP and PR System
Why in the News?
India should contemplate proportional representation to ensure fairer political outcomes, given NDA’s 293 seats (43.3%) compared to INDIA bloc’s 234 seats (41.6%).
First Past the Post (FPTP) System
First Past the Post (FPTP) is a voting system where the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins, regardless of whether they achieve an absolute majority.
Simple and feasible method used in large democracies like India, the U.S., the U.K., and Canada.
Provides stability to the executive as the ruling party/coalition can enjoy a majority in the legislature without obtaining a majority of the votes across constituencies.
Criticized for potentially resulting in over or under-representation of political parties compared to their vote share.
Proportional Representation (PR) System:
Ensures representation of all parties based on their vote share. Commonly implemented through party list PR, where voters vote for parties rather than individual candidates. PR system applied at each State/Union Territory (UT) level in federal countries like India.
Pros and Cons Comparison between FPTP and PR
First Past the Post (FPTP):
Pros:
Simple, stable majority governments, clear constituency representation.
Cons:
Disproportionate representation, underrepresentation of minorities, many wasted votes.
Proportional Representation (PR):
Fairer representation, inclusivity of smaller parties, fewer wasted votes.
Complex, potential for unstable coalitions, weaker direct constituency representation.
International Practices:
The PR system is used in presidential democracies like Brazil and Argentina, as well as parliamentary democracies like South Africa, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain.
Mixed Member Proportional Representation (MMPR) system
employed in Germany and New Zealand.
Germany:
Germany uses MMPR for elections to the Bundestag. Half of the seats are filled through FPTP constituencies, and the other half are allocated to ensure proportional representation based on party votes, provided parties receive at least 5% of the vote.
New Zealand:
New Zealand’s House of Representatives is elected using MMPR, with 60% of seats filled through constituency elections and 40% allocated proportionally based on party votes.
is a hybrid electoral system that combines elements of First Past the Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) to ensure both local representation and proportionality in election results.
Way Forward:
The Law Commission, in its 170th report
titled ‘Reform of the Electoral Laws’ (1999), recommended the experimental introduction of the Mixed Member Proportional Representation (MMPR) system. It suggested that 25% of seats in the Lok Sabha could be filled using a Proportional Representation (PR) system by increasing the total number of seats.
Incremental implementation of MMPR system for additional seats during delimitation exercises to address population disparities while ensuring fair representation for all regions.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Birsa Munda, Sardari Agitation, Birsait Faith, Ulgulan, Khuntkattidar System.
Why in the News?
Jharkhand CM marked the 124th death anniversary of revolutionary tribal leader “
Birsa Munda”
by paying his tributes.
Who was Birsa Munda (1875-1900)?
Birsa Munda was born on November 15, 1875, during a period of significant change for his community, the Mundas, residing in the Chotanagpur region of present-day Jharkhand.
Birsa Munda spent his early years travelling with his parents and received
primary education
under
Jaipal Nag.
Inspired by the peaceful
Sardari agitation
against British rule, Birsa became a prominent leader advocating for tribal rights.
Causes of the Rebellion
Impact of Colonial Policies:
Colonial policies, including the Permanent Settlement Act (1793), disrupted traditional land ownership systems, leading to displacement and exploitation of indigenous communities.
Erosion of Khuntkattidar System:
The Mundas’ traditional land rights system, known as khuntkatti, was eroded by jagirdars and thikadars, leading to land alienation.
Land Alienation and Exploitation:
Non-tribal migration into tribal regions accelerated under British rule, resulting in exploitation through high-interest money lending and forced labour.
Missionary Activity:
The spread of education through missionary activities led to increased awareness among tribals, deepening social cleavages but also inspiring movements for tribal reconstruction.
Major Activities:
1. New faith ‘Birsait’ against religious conversion
Having gained awareness of the British colonial ruler and the efforts of the missionaries to convert tribals to Christianity, Birsa started the
faith of ‘Birsait’
Soon members of the
Munda and Oraon community
started joining the Birsait sect and it turned into a challenge to British conversion activities.
The Mundas called him
Dharati Aaba
, the father of earth.
2.
The Birsa Movement: Ulgulan
The Munda Rebellion was a tribal rebellion led by Birsa Munda in the region
south of Ranchi
in 1899-1900.
It mainly concentrated in the Munda belt of
Khunti, Tamar, Sarwada, and Bandgaon
The revolt sought to establish Munda Raj and independence, known as
‘Great Tumult’
by Munda tribals.
The rebellion ended with the suppression by British forces and the death of Birsa Munda.
Significant Outcomes
Impact:
Birsa Munda’s mobilization of tribal communities left a lasting legacy, prompting government reforms such as the repeal of the Begar system and the enactment of the
Tenancy Act (1903).
His Death:
The movement was violently suppressed and Birsa Munda died in jail on 9 June 1900.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Hydrogen Line and its significance in interstellar studies
Why in the News?
The hydrogen line stands as a pivotal tool in contemporary astronomy, serving various purposes from studying distant stars to questing for extraterrestrial intelligence, should it exist.
What is a Hydrogen Line?
The hydrogen line is a
special type of light
that hydrogen atoms emit.
It happens when an
electron
, a tiny particle that
orbits the nucleus
of the
, jumps from a higher energy level to a lower one.
This jump releases energy in the form of light, specifically with a
wavelength
of about
21 centimetres
. This wavelength is what scientists call the hydrogen line.
Why is it Important?
Hydrogen is everywhere in the universe. It’s the simplest and most abundant element, making up about 75% of the universe’s elemental mass.
So, studying the hydrogen line allows us to understand a lot about the composition and distribution of matter in the universe.
By observing the hydrogen line’s emission from different regions of space, astronomers
can create maps
showing where hydrogen gas is located.
Secrets about the early Universe
: The hydrogen line also holds secrets about the early universe. Shortly after the Big Bang, the universe was filled with hydrogen gas.
By studying the hydrogen line from distant parts of the universe, astronomers can learn about its conditions and evolution billions of years ago.
How Do We Interpret Hydrogen Line?
Radio telescope data enables mapping of hydrogen distribution, revealing locations of hydrogen clouds crucial for understanding galaxy and galaxy cluster formation and evolution.
Observing hydrogen line emission from different galaxy parts enables studying internal structures and dynamics, like rotation curves, offering insights into mass distribution within galaxies.
Observing hydrogen lines from distant galaxies unveils early universe conditions, aiding in understanding cosmic evolution’s initial stages.
What’s Next?
New Discoveries
: Scientists are continually developing new technologies and techniques to improve the sensitivity and resolution of radio telescopes.
This enables them to detect fainter signals and uncover new insights into the universe’s hydrogen content.
Exploring Dark Matter
: The hydrogen line observations could also contribute to understanding dark matter, an invisible substance that makes up about 27% of the universe’s total mass-energy content.
By studying the hydrogen distribution in relation to the gravitational effects observed in galaxies, scientists hope to shed light on the nature of dark matter.
