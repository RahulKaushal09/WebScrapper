Why in News?
Recently, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change observed
(11
December) to highlight the need to protect the
Indian Himalayan Region (IHR).
What is International Mountain Day?
History
: International Mountain Day, observed on 11
, was established by the
United Nations
2003
to raise awareness about sustainable development in mountains and their vital importance to life.
The
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
plays a key role in coordinating this observance.
Theme 2024
Mountain solutions for a sustainable future – innovation, adaptation and youth.
Importance of Mountains:
Mountains cover about
one-fifth of the Earth's surface
and are home to
15% of the world’s population
and host half of the world’s biodiversity hotspots.
They provide essential freshwater for half of humanity acting as
"water towers",
supporting agriculture,
clean energy,
and health sectors.
Mountains are ecological treasures that need protection. Without them, many countries would face dry, barren land. Their preservation is key to sustainable development.
What are the Key Facts About Indian Himalayan Region (IHR)?
Geographical Extent
: The IHR stretches across
13 Indian states/Union Territories
, including Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and parts of West Bengal, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Meghalaya.
It spans a distance of approximately
2,500 km
from west to east.
Tectonic Activity
: The IHR is tectonically active due to the ongoing collision between the
Indian Plate and the
Eurasian Plate
This has led to the formation of the
Himalayan mountains
and continues to shape the region’s geological features.
Geological Diversity:
The region is rich in geological features, with varying rock formations, fault lines, and plateaus. There are
igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks
found in different sections of the Himalayas.
Significance
: The IHR covers about
16.2% of the country's total geographical area.
The region is a
, home to numerous plant and animal species, some of which are endemic or endangered.
The region is the source of major river systems, including the
Ganga,
Yamuna,
Indus
Brahmaputra.
The region features various ecosystems, including
temperate forests, alpine meadows, glaciers, and snow-capped peaks
It is home to iconic wildlife such as the
snow leopard,
Himalayan tahr
red panda,
one-horned rhinoceros.
The IHR plays a critical role in
regulating the climate
of the Indian subcontinent by acting as a barrier to
cold, dry
Arctic winds
and influencing the
monsoon patterns
The region also helps in
carbon sequestration
through its forests, contributing to the global fight against climate change.
The IHR acts as a natural
border
between India and several neighboring countries like
China
Nepal
Bhutan
Pakistan
Concerns:
Unsustainable Development:
Activities like
deforestation
Hydropower Projects in Himalayas
, and infrastructure projects like
Char Dham Project
disrupt ecosystems and contribute to
disasters.
Climate Change Impact:
Glacial melting and expanding lakes increase
flood risks,
while temperature rise affects water resources.
Events like floods in Himachal Pradesh, and
glacial lake outbursts
in Sikkim highlight the consequences.
Cultural Erosion:
home to indigenous communities
with valuable traditional knowledge for sustainable resource management, but modernisation threatens to
erode these cultural practices.
Rising Tourism:
Tourism generates
8 million tonnes of waste annually,
projections indicating 240 million tourists by 2025.
The region's fragile ecology is under threat, as waste often ends up polluting land, water, and air due to the
lack of space for disposal in mountain towns.

What Can be Done to Protect Indian Himalayan Region?
Sustainable Tourism
: Promote
eco-tourism,
enforce carrying capacity limits, and raise awareness to generate income for locals while minimizing environmental impact.
Glacial Water Capture
: Implement methods to capture and
store glacial meltwater
for use during dry periods to support agriculture and ecosystems.
Disaster Preparedness
: Develop
disaster management plans
for the region, focusing on
landslides, avalanches, and glacial lake outburst floods
, with early warning systems and community training.
Greywater Recycling
: Set up systems to recycle household greywater for agricultural use, enhancing water security and crop growth.
Bio-Cultural Conservation Zones
: Designate areas to preserve both natural biodiversity and indigenous cultural practices.
Integrated Development
: Establish a “Himalayan Authority” for coordinated development and monitoring of Sustainable Development Goals across the region.
How are Mountains Formed?
Formation
: Mountains are formed by movement within the Earth's crust, which consists of
tectonic plates floating on molten magma.
These plates shift and collide over time, creating pressure that causes the Earth's surface to
buckle or protrude, forming mountains.
Key Characteristics:
Elevation
: Mountains are generally higher than the surrounding land, with elevation often exceeding 600 meters.
Steep Slopes
: Mountains typically have steep slopes, though some can be more gradual.
Summit/Peak
: The top of a mountain is called the summit, which is often the highest point.
Mountain Range
: A series or group of mountains connected by high ground forms a mountain range.
What are the Types of Mountain?
Based on Mode of Origin:
Volcanic Mountains
: Formed by the eruption of magma from the Earth's crust, creating peaks like those in Hawaii and Fiji.
Fold Mountains
: Created by the collision and folding of tectonic plates, such as the
Himalayas and the Andes.
Block Mountains
: Formed by faulting and the movement of
large blocks of the Earth's crust,
leading to raised or dropped sections, like the Sierra Nevada.
Dome Mountains:
Created by magma pushing the Earth's crust upward, forming a
dome-like structure,
often exposed after erosion like Black Hills (US).
Plateau Mountains:
These mountains resemble dome mountains but are formed by
colliding tectonic plates pushing up the land
, shaped by
weathering and erosion.
Based on Period of Origin
Precambrian Mountains
: Precambrian mountains are ancient ranges formed during the Precambrian era (4.6 billion to 541 million years ago).
They have experienced extensive erosion and metamorphism over billions of years, leaving behind residual formations (e.g.,
Aravallis
in India).
Caledonian Mountains
: Formed around 430 million years ago (e.g., Appalachians).
Hercynian Mountains:
These mountains originated from the Carboniferous to Permian Period (approximately 340 million years and 225 million years) (e.g., Ural Mountains).
Alpine Mountains
: The youngest mountain systems formed during the Tertiary period(66 million years ago) (e.g., Himalayas, Alps).
What are the Key Facts About Mountain Ranges in India?
The Himalayas:
The most famous and
highest mountain range in India
, stretching over 2,900 kilometers along the border between India and Tibet.
The Himalayas are divided into three main ranges,
Himadri (Great Himalayas or Inner Himalayas), Himachal (Lesser Himalayas), Shiwaliks (Outer Himalayas).
Mount Everest (Sagarmatha/Chomolungma)
is the highest peak in the Himalayas and the world, standing at an elevation of 8,848.86 meters above sea level. Other notable peaks in the range include
K2,
Kanchenjunga,
Makalu
Western Ghats:
(Sahyadri Hills) runs parallel to the western coast of India and has an average elevation of about 1,200 meters.
The highest peak is
Anamudi
. The Western Ghats are known for their rich biodiversity and are a
UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Western Ghats are block mountains formed
by the downwarping of land into the Arabian Sea.
Eastern Ghats
runs parallel to the eastern coast of India. The highest peak is Arma Konda at 1,680 meters.
Aravalli Range:
One of the oldest mountain ranges in the world, stretching for about 800 kilometers across north - western India,. The
highest peak is Guru Shikhar
at 1,722 meters
Vindhya Range:
Vindhya range
runs across central India and is known for its historical significance. The highest point is
Sadbhawna Shikhar
at 752 meters.
The Vindhya Range is located to the south of the
Malwa Plateau
and runs in an east-west direction, parallel to the Narmada Valley.
Satpura Range:
Located in central India, this range has peaks like Dhupgarh, which is the highest at 1,350 meters.

UNCCD's Drought Atlas
Source: DTE
Why in News?
At the
UNCCD  COP16
in Riyadh, the
UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)
and the
European Commission's Joint Research Centre
launched the
World Drought Atlas
– a comprehensive global publication on drought risks and solutions.
What are the Key Findings of the UNCCD's Drought Atlas?
Systemic Nature of Drought Risks:
Drought is a systemic risk affecting multiple sectors globally. It projects that
by 2050, 75% of the world's population (nearly 3 in 4 people)
will be affected by drought conditions if current trends continue.
In 2022 and 2023 alone,
1.84 billion
(nearly 1 in 4 globally)
were affected by drought, with about
85% in low- and middle-income countries
Economic Consequences:
Droughts can severely impact agriculture, energy production, and trade. UNCCD asserts that the economic costs of the damages done due to droughts is underestimated by
2.4 times
amounting to
USD 307 billion per year.
Drought Vulnerability in India:
India is particularly vulnerable to
due to its diverse climatic conditions and reliance on monsoon rains for agriculture.
The Atlas underscores that approximately
60% of India's
agricultural land
is rain-fed
, making it susceptible to fluctuations in rainfall patterns.
2016 drought in Southern India
was due to exceptionally
low rainfall during both summer and
winter monsoons
Rapid urbanization
has caused water mismanagement in
cities like Chennai,
leading to a severe crisis despite ample rainfall.
UNCCD report blames human activities
and occasional lack of rain for drought and resource degradation.
What are the Key Recommendations of the World Drought Atlas?
Governance:
Countries should develop and implement comprehensive national drought plans to enhance preparedness and resilience against drought events.
Strengthening international collaboration is essential for sharing knowledge, resources, and best practices to effectively manage drought risks across borders.
Developing financial mechanisms, such as microinsurance for smallholder farmers, can provide safety nets for vulnerable populations affected by drought.
Land Use Management:
Sustainable agriculture practices, such as
land restoration via reforestation, soil conservation, crop diversification and agroforestry
, are essential for building resilience against drought.
These measures
reduce runoff and increase stormwater retention
improving soil quality
, providing
shade for livestock and reducing evapotranspiration
, which strengthens vegetation's resilience to drought
Management of Water Supply and Use:
Investment in Infrastructure:
Increased investment in infrastructure for water supply and management, such as wastewater reuse and groundwater recharge systems, is necessary to enhance water security during droughts

Ninetyeast Ridge
Source: Phys.org
Why in News?
A recent
Nature Communications
study reveals that the
,
Earth's longest straight underwater mountain chain,
was formed by a
moving hotspot,
challenging the earlier belief that it originated from a
stationary hotspot.
This study provides new insights into
Earth’s tectonic processes,
and age estimates of Ninetyeast Ridge.
What are the Key Findings of the Study?
Formation by a Moving Hotspot
: The Ninetyeast Ridge, a 5,000 km-long underwater mountain chain in the
Indian Ocean,
was formed by the
Kerguelen hotspot(volcanic hotspot located
Kerguelen Plateau
in the Southern Indian Ocean
),
which moved several hundred kilometers within the
Earth's mantle,
rather than being formed by a
as previously believed.
The study is the first documented case of a
moving hotspot in the Indian Ocean,
contributing new evidence to the
theory of hotspot movement, which has been difficult to prove.
Age Estimates
: High-precision
dating of mineral samples
from the ridge shows that the
Ninetyeast Ridge formed between 83 and 43 million years ago.
Impact on Tectonic Models
: The study provides a more accurate reconstruction of
Earth's tectonic history
and highlights the importance of understanding mantle dynamics and hotspot movement to better predict
natural disasters.

What is the Ninetyeast Ridge?
About:
The Ninetyeast Ridge is a
linear
aseismic ridge
. It is named for its near-parallel alignment with the
90
meridian east.
This underwater mountain range stretches approximately
5,000 kilometers
Bay of Bengal
in the north to the
Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR)
in the south.
The northern segment of the Ninetyeast Ridge has
massive volcanoes
, the southern part is tall and continuous, and the middle section includes
small seamounts and straight segments.
It divides the Indian Ocean into the
West Indian Ocean and the eastern Indian Ocean.
Formation of the Ninety East Ridge:
The most widely accepted theory is the
hotspot theory,
with some geologists attributing the
ridge's formation to the Kerguelen hotspot.
As the
Indo-Australian plate
moved north, it passed over this hotspot, forming the ridge.
The formation process ceased due to a
reorganization in the tectonic plate
boundaries, and further research ongoing to confirm this theory.
Composition:
Primarily made of
Ocean Island Tholeiites (OIT),
a type of
sub-alkaline basalt rock.
Rocks in the southern part of Ninetyeast Ridge are younger (43.2 million years) compared to the northern part (81.8 million years).

What is the Geological Significance of a Hotspot?
A hotspot is an area where
hot plumes of molten rock (magma) rise
deep within
Earth's mantle.
These plumes can form volcanoes on the
Earth's crust
as they reach the surface.
Unlike most volcanic activity,
hotspot volcanism
is not driven by
tectonic plate boundaries
but rather by
stationary plumes beneath moving plates.
Hotspot Volcanism and Submarine Volcanism:
Hotspot volcanism is different from submarine volcanism
Submarine volcanism
happens where tectonic plates meet and move(plate boundaries).
In contrast, Hotspot volcanism occurs within lithospheric plates, rather than at plate boundaries where convergence or divergence happens.
Hotspot Track:
As tectonic plates move over a hotspot,
active volcanoes form above the plume,
while older ones are carried away,
creating a chain of islands or
seamounts.
A hotspot track is a
linear chain of volcanoes
formed by a stationary plume beneath a moving tectonic plate. The
youngest
and most active volcano is
with older volcanoes further away in the direction of plate movement.
Hawaiian Islands
and their seamount chain
are a prime example of a
hotspot track,
with the Island of Hawaii being the youngest and most active in the chain.
Dynamic Nature of Hotspots:
There is ongoing debate about the irregular volcanism patterns observed in island chains like the
Cook-Australs, Marshalls, Gilberts, and Line Islands.
Some theories suggest that
hotspots, traditionally thought to be stationary, may actually be dynamic.
The debate continues as scientists gather more data to understand the complex processes driving volcanism in these regions.
How Do Hotspots Impact Tectonic Plates and Natural Disasters?
Hotspot Influence on Tectonic Plates:
Volcanic Chains and Plate Movement:
The sequence of these islands, from youngest to oldest,
provides evidence for plate motion.
The distance between these islands also allows scientists to estimate
plate speed.
Hotspots, linked to geothermal features like
geysers
, offer insights into
tectonic plate movements and interactions.
Mantle plumes drive plate tectonics by supplying heat and movement, crucial for the large-scale motion of Earth's tectonic plates.
Rifting and Continental Breakup:
Hotspots can contribute to
continental rifting,
where plates pull apart.
A mantle plume beneath a continent can weaken the lithosphere, causing it to break apart.
East African Rift
is an example of a continent being split.
Mantle and Hotspot Influence of Natural Disasters:
Earthquakes:
Mantle plumes and the movement of tectonic plates can lead to earthquakes. Understanding the dynamics of these movements helps in identifying regions at risk of
seismic activity.
This knowledge is essential for designing and
implementing
early warning systems
Tsunamis:
Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions under the ocean can trigger
tsunamis.
By studying the patterns of mantle dynamics and hotspot activity, scientists can better predict the
likelihood of such events and issue warnings to coastal areas.

Drishti Mains Question:
Examine the role of hotspots in plate tectonics and their impact on the formation of volcanic islands.

Lake-Effect Snow
Source: IE
Why in News?
Recently, parts of upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, situated along the
Great Lakes of North America
, witnessed
"lake-effect snow."
A heavy snowstorm caused by this phenomenon near
Lake Erie in New York
has transformed homes into
ice-covered igloos.
What is Lake-Effect Snow?
Definition:
Lake-effect snow is a
localized weather phenomenon
characterized by
heavy snowfall
that occurs near
large bodies of water,
such as the
Great Lakes in North America.
It typically happens during colder months when cold air passes over relatively warmer lake surfaces, resulting in intense and narrow bands of snowfall.
Mechanism of Formation:
Cold Air Movement
: Cold air often from Canada, flows over the unfrozen, warmer waters of the Great Lakes in North America.
The lakes transfer heat and moisture to the cold air at the surface.
Cloud Formation
: The warm, moist air
rises, cools rapidly in the colder atmosphere above
condenses to form clouds.
Snowfall
: These clouds develop into narrow bands that produce intense snowfall, often at rates of 2–3 inches or more per hour.
