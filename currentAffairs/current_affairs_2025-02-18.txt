**********Sovereign Green Bonds (SGBs)
Like several emerging markets, India also turned to sovereign green bonds to help fund its transition to a low-carbon economy, but investor demand remains weak.
About Sovereign Green Bonds (SGBs):
● SGBs are debt securities issued by a national government to fund projects that have positive environmental benefits.
● The proceeds from these bonds are exclusively allocated to green initiatives, which can include renewable energy projects, sustainable agriculture, waste management, and more.
● Essentially, these bonds are a way for governments to raise capital while promoting environmental sustainability.
Sovereign Green Bonds in India:
The Union Budget 2022-23 announced the issue of
. The framework for the
was issued by the government on November 9, 2022.
What does the framework entail?
The government’s framework is
based on the International Capital Market Association’s (ICMA) listed principles
for issuing green bonds, which has four components:
Use of proceeds, project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds, and reporting.
The government said the bonds’ proceeds will be used for green projects that:
Encourage energy efficiency
Reduce carbon emissions and greenhouse gases
Promote climate resilience and/or adaptation
Improve natural ecosystems and biodiversity, especially in accordance with the principles of sustainable development goals
The framework listed
investments in solar, wind, biomass, and hydro energy
projects, and
urban mass transportation projects
such as metro rail, green buildings, pollution prevention and control projects.
excluded projects such as fossil fuels, nuclear power generation,
direct waste incineration.
The eligible expenditure is limited to government spending that occurred not more than 12 months prior to issuance.
proceeds should be allocated to projects within 24 months
of issuing the bonds.
If an eligible green project is postponed or cancelled, it will be replaced by another eligible green project.
How will green projects be evaluated and reported?
The Ministry of Finance has constituted a
Green Finance Working Committee
composed of relevant ministries and chaired by the chief economic adviser.
The ministries will submit their projects to the committee, which will meet at least twice a year to evaluate the proposals.
Once the projects are evaluated, the final list will be given to the budget division of the finance ministry.
The division will then
issue the bonds through the RBI
and use the proceeds to finance the selected projects.
The government will release an
annual report on the selection of green projects,
the funds deployed, and their impact on the greening of the economy.
It will also maintain a
Green Register
with details of the green bond issuance, the proceeds generated, allocations made, and information about the eligible projects.

**********Earthquake Swarm
A state of emergency has been declared on Greece’s Santorini and the nearby islands of Ios, Amorgos, and Anafi after a swarm of undersea earthquakes this month.
About Earthquake Swarm:
It occurs when
multiple seismic events
of comparable intensity strike a small area
in relatively quick succession.
It involves a series of many (sometimes thousands)
low-intensity earthquakes
without a discernible main shock that can occur over weeks in active geothermal areas.
When
seismic energy piles up inside the Earth
and is released in small amounts from certain points, such a series of earthquakes can occur.
What causes swarm sequences?
Fluid movement:
In volcanic environments, this can be fluid
released from deeper magma or circulating within
active geothermal areas (in volcanic areas such as the Taupō Volcanic Zone).
The earthquakes triggered by
fluids occur as fault slip
on the cracks and faults through which the water is moving.
Active volcanism:
Magma movement can also act as the ‘driving mechanism’ for swarms, creating the earthquakes as magma-filled cracks push their way through the Earth’s crust.
In such a case the earthquakes
commonly occur near the crack tip
(ahead of the magma where the crack is starting to open), or off to the side of the crack.
Slow-slip events
A slow-slip event is
essentially an earthquake in slow-motion
, and typically involves centimetres to tens of centimetres of movement along a fault, over weeks to years.
We commonly see slow slip events at the
Hikurangi subduction zone
, usually at least one or two per year.

**********Ovoid cells
Researchers have discovered a new type of neuron that plays a fundamental role in recognition memory and named “ovoid cells.”
About Ovoid cells:
These cells are named for the
distinct egg-like shape
of their cell bodies, are present in relatively small numbers within the hippocampus of humans, mice, and other animals.
These are
highly specialized neurons
which get activated each time when we encounter something new.
It triggers a process that stores those objects in memory and allows us to recognize them months, potentially even years later.
They are quite distinct from other neurons at a cellular and functional level, and in terms of their neural circuitry.
Significance:
This discovery provides key insights into how memories form and could aid in the
treatment of brain conditions
related to object recognition, such as
Alzheimer's disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder and epilepsy
What are Neurons?
Also known as a nerve cell, it is a
specialized cell in the nervous system
that is responsible for transmitting information through electrical and chemical signals.
Neurons are the basic building blocks of the nervous system and play a crucial role in processing and transmitting information within the body.

**********Delhi Earthquake: Causes, Impact, and Seismic Risk
Why in the News?
A 4.0 magnitude earthquake struck the national capital on 17
February morning, with the epicentre being located near Durgabai Deshmukh College of Special Education in Dhaula Kuan.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, Seismic Activity in India, Aravalli-Delhi Fold, Possibility of Large Earth Quake in Delhi, etc.)
Introduction:
Delhi is located in a seismically active region, making it susceptible to earthquakes.
Although most tremors felt in the city originate from far-off places like Afghanistan or the Himalayan region, the recent earthquake originated
within Delhi itself
The event has sparked discussions about the city's seismic risk, geological features, and the possibility of stronger earthquakes in the future.
Seismic Activity in Delhi:
Delhi falls under
Zone 4
of India’s
earthquake hazard map
, meaning it is in the second-highest category of risk.
This classification is based on the
MSK scale (Medvedev-Sponheuer-Karnik scale)
, which measures earthquake intensity.
Zone 4 areas can experience MSK-8 intensity
, making them vulnerable to structural damage.
In the last five years, Delhi and its surrounding regions have recorded multiple
small earthquakes (magnitude 2-3)
, mostly unnoticed by residents but detected by seismometers.
Such low-magnitude tremors are common, but stronger quakes are rare in the region.
Understanding the Aravalli-Delhi Fold Belt:
Delhi is part of the
, a geological structure that extends from
southern and eastern Rajasthan to Haryana and Delhi
This region has undergone
significant geological changes over millions of years
, leading to folded rock formations.
These geological stresses can sometimes trigger mild earthquakes.
Different from Himalayan Earthquakes:
Unlike the
Himalayan earthquakes
, which are caused by the subduction of the
Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian plate
, earthquakes in the Aravalli-Delhi Fold Belt occur due to
pre-existing geological faults
Although the region was
more seismically active in the past
, tectonic activity has
slowed down over time
, making strong earthquakes less likely.
Sound During the Earthquake:
Many Delhi residents reported hearing a
peculiar sound
during the earthquake.
While
earthquakes do produce sound
, it is often at frequencies
beyond human hearing
However, in some cases,
large earthquakes can create audible sounds
due to vibrations.
These sounds are often mistaken for the earthquake itself but are usually caused by the
shaking of buildings, objects, or underground structures
Possibility of a Large Earthquake in Delhi:
While historical records mention strong earthquakes affecting Delhi in the past, experts believe that a
major earthquake originating in Delhi is highly unlikely
. The strongest known earthquakes in Delhi’s history include:
1720:
A powerful earthquake reported in Delhi.
1803:
A large earthquake that supposedly damaged the
Qutub Minar
(later found to have originated near
Srinagar-Devprayag in Uttarakhand
).
Delhi’s tectonic setup does not indicate the presence of large stress build-ups required for
high-magnitude earthquakes
However, the city remains vulnerable to strong quakes originating in the
, which could cause significant damage due to its
dense population and high-rise buildings
Conclusion:
Delhi’s recent earthquake has once again highlighted the city's
seismic vulnerability
While a
large earthquake in Delhi is unlikely
, the city’s location in
means it is susceptible to moderate tremors.
Delhi’s seismic history and geological structure
is crucial for preparedness and disaster mitigation.
Authorities and residents should remain vigilant and ensure that
buildings and infrastructure
are earthquake-resistant to minimize risks in case of a stronger quake in the future.

**********Renewed India-US nuclear cooperation
Why in news?
The renewed US-India nuclear cooperation signals a diplomatic win for India amid challenging trade discussions with the new US administration.
Three
key gains emerge: a reaffirmed commitment to the
123 Civil Nuclear Agreement
, recognition of past stagnation, and a push to maximize the benefits of the Indo-US nuclear deal signed two decades ago.
What’s in today’s article?
Large-Scale Localisation & Technology Transfer
Upgrading Reactor Specialisation
Other Benefits
Despite the US’s protectionist trade stance, the renewed nuclear cooperation includes a commitment to jointly build American-designed reactors in India.
The pact emphasizes local manufacturing and potential tech transfer, deviating from Washington’s usual push to retain manufacturing within the US.
The new nuclear deal provides India with an opportunity to modernize its reactor technology, aligning with globally prevalent designs and accelerating capacity expansion.
Advancing in
Small Modular Reactors
(SMRs)
India aims to leverage private sector expertise to enter the growing SMR segment.
While India has experience with 220MWe PHWRs, its reliance on heavy water and natural uranium makes it outdated compared to the dominant pressurised water reactors (PWRs) which use light water.
Exploring Global Collaborations
India’s Department of Atomic Energy is in discussions with Holtec International, a major nuclear technology exporter, to explore potential SMR collaborations.
Strategic Joint Push in SMRs
India and the US are collaborating on SMRs to compete with China, which is emerging as a leader in this field.
SMRs are a critical tool for both countries to expand their influence in the Global South, where China has capitalized on the opportunity in industries like electric vehicles.
Overcoming Technological and Economic Challenges
India’s technological limitations and the US’s high labor costs make it challenging to compete with China independently.
The partnership opens up India’s nuclear sector, potentially ending the country’s technology isolation and boosting its role in the global nuclear market.
Holtec International’s Role and Investments
Holtec International plans to expand its operations in India, including establishing a nuclear technology campus in Pune and a specialty manufacturing plant.
The company anticipates significant foreign investment in India’s nuclear sector, driving economic growth.
Reviving Nuclear Cooperation
The 123 agreement between India and the US, signed in 2007, aimed to foster full civil nuclear energy cooperation but faced obstacles due to legislative challenges.
India’s efforts to amend laws could break this deadlock, leading to joint manufacturing and SMR projects.
SMRs: The Future of Nuclear Energy
SMRs (30MWe to 300MWe) are gaining prominence as a sustainable and commercially viable option in the energy sector.
Holtec’s SMR-300, supported by the US Department of Energy, is in early design stages, with potential deployments in the UK and Canada.
Other Western competitors include Rolls-Royce, NuScale, Westinghouse, and GE-Hitachi.

**********DDoS cyberattack hit Karnataka’s Kaveri 2.0 portal
Why in news?
In January, Karnataka’s property registration portal, Kaveri 2.0, faced severe outages, disrupting citizen services. An investigation by the Revenue and E-Governance Departments revealed that the disruption was not due to technical glitches but a deliberate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
The cyberattack on the 2023-launched portal underscores the vulnerability of critical digital infrastructure to cyber threats.
What’s in today’s article?
About Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
Impact of DDoS Attacks on Web Portals
Ways to Mitigate DDoS Attacks
DDoS Attack on Kaveri 2.0
DDoS attack is a cyberattack designed to disrupt the normal functioning of a server, service, or network by overwhelming it with excessive internet traffic.
How It Works
Unlike a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which originates from a single source, a
uses multiple compromised systems, often infected with malware, to generate traffic.
These systems form a botnet that floods the target with requests.
Types of DDoS Attacks
Bandwidth Saturation:
Overloading a site’s bandwidth.
Protocol Exploitation:
Exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols.
Application Targeting:
Attacking weaknesses in specific applications or services.
Prominent DDoS Attacks
Attack on X Platform (August 2024)
Elon Musk’s X platform suffered a massive DDoS attack, causing delays and disruptions.
The attack occurred just before Musk’s scheduled conversation with Donald Trump, the then Republican presidential candidate, highlighting the risks faced by high-profile platforms.
Attack on GitHub (2015)
Microsoft-owned GitHub was targeted by a China-based botnet, specifically aiming at two projects that provided tools to bypass Chinese state censorship.
The attack leveraged malicious JavaScript injection in visitors' browsers from Baidu’s analytics services.
Service Downtime
The primary goal of a DDoS attack is to overwhelm a web portal, making it inaccessible to users.
This leads to disruptions in operations and potential loss of revenue.
Distraction for Other Cyberattacks
While DDoS attacks do not steal data directly, they can serve as a diversion, allowing hackers to execute data breaches or other cyber threats unnoticed.
Reputational Damage
Frequent DDoS attacks can harm an organization’s
credibility
, making customers and partners
question
its ability to
secure
digital services.
Advanced Traffic Filtering
Organisations use traffic filtering mechanisms to differentiate between legitimate and malicious traffic, preventing overload.
Continuous Monitoring
Monitoring tools help detect unusual traffic patterns early, allowing for pre-emptive actions before an attack escalates.
Rate Limiting
Restricting the number of requests per user within a set time frame helps prevent the system from being overwhelmed.
Bot Detection Technologies
Using CAPTCHAs and behavioural analysis helps identify and block automated bots attempting to exploit the system.
Strong Authentication & Security Audits
Implementing robust authentication, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), along with regular security audits, helps prevent unauthorised access.
Collaboration with Cybersecurity Agencies
This enables better investigation, information sharing, and mitigation strategies to prevent future attacks.
User Awareness & Protection
Educating users on phishing risks, enforcing strong passwords, and promoting security best practices can reduce the risk of account compromises.
Incident Response Planning
A dedicated security team should be in place to monitor, detect, and respond to security threats effectively.
portal, crucial for
property registrations
performance issues

making database entries, overwhelming the system.
The attack involved 62 email accounts from 14 IP addresses, indicating a distributed attack.
Major Attack in January 2025
A second wave of the attack saw extremely high traffic, especially for encumbrance certificate (EC) searches, which surged to eight times the usual volume.
Within two hours, the portal received 6.2 lakh malicious requests, using random keywords to flood the system.
The attack crippled the portal, causing a significant drop in property registrations, disrupting citizen services, and exposing cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Future of Kaveri 2.0
The Kaveri 2.0 portal, severely impacted by the cyberattack, saw significant drops in property registrations on February 1 and 4.
However, it was restored on February 5.
The attack highlights the need for government agencies and organisations to prioritise cybersecurity and implement robust mitigation strategies to prevent future disruptions.

**********India-US Trade Relations - Navigating the New Normal
Context:
The recent meeting
between Prime Minister
Narendra Modi
and US President
Donald Trump
covered key issues, with a strong focus on setting ambitious trade targets. The meeting took place amid global trade uncertainties and shifting trade norms.
Mission 500:
Towards a $500 billion trade target:
India and the US have agreed on a Bilateral Trade Agreement (
BTA
) under the broader framework of
COMPACT
(Catalysing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce, and Technology).
The ambitious goal is
to achieve $500 billion bilateral trade by 2030
How to achieve this mega partnership for prosperity?
PM Modi emphasized deeper economic ties to achieve this trade expansion.
Sectoral Trade Potential and its Significance:
Strong intra-industry trade potential exists in key sectors:
US strengths:
Plastics, base metals, precision instruments.
India's strengths:
Vegetable products, processed foods, stone, and plaster.
This sectoral trade may help in
reducing the bilateral trade deficit
Understanding the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA):
About:
The BTA will aim to adapt an integrated approach for deepening trade across the goods and services sector.
BTA vs FTA:
A BTA is
less complex
than a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), focusing on tariff reductions, non-tariff barriers (NTBs), and trade facilitation.
Unlike an FTA, a BTA is a flexible sector-focused agreement that
does not cover
"substantially all trade" and
incorporates
simplified Rules of Origin (RoO).
The agreement
aligns with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules
while allowing
preferential trading arrangements
Key objectives:
Reduce tariffs and NTBs.
Enhance market access.
Strengthen supply chains.
Global Trade Shifts and the MFN Principle:
Trump's policies are shifting global trade
away from the Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) principle.
Through the
idea of MFN
, WTO members extend any trade advantage granted to one trading partner to all other partners.
It was in
1947
that MFN was incorporated as a guiding principle for global trade in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
This framework was strengthened and absorbed when the transition from the GATT to the WTO was made.
So far, the non-discriminatory MFN trading principle has remained
a cornerstone of global trade.
The WTO’s Integrated Database (IDB) in January 2025 shows that
more than 80% of world merchandise trade
is conducted under MFN terms.
The US move towards bilateral and preferential trade arrangements
challenges the WTO’s non-discriminatory trade framework.
China has approached the WTO
against additional US tariffs, citing violations of MFN obligations under GATT.
Key Takeaways for India:
Quick adaptation:
India must proactively respond to evolving trade dynamics. The PMO should lead trade negotiations with greater agility.
Leveraging COMPACT:
India should use COMPACT to overcome NTBs and enhance market access, while learning from US trade instruments like Tariff-Rate Quotas (TRQs).
Strengthening the MFN framework:
India should work with
Global South
nations to uphold MFN principles, ensuring a stable and inclusive trade architecture.
Conclusion:
The India-US BTA marks a significant step in deepening economic ties. However,
India must strategically navigate shifting global trade rules
while ensuring its long-term interests in a rules-based trade system.

Editorial Analysis
**********Georgia and the Resurrection of the Colour Revolutions
Context
The
dawn of the 21st century witnessed a wave of uprisings in post-Soviet states
, collectively known as the colour revolutions.
These movements,
often peaceful and democratic in nature, sought to replace pro-Moscow governments
with pro-Western leadership, advocating for democratic reforms.
However,
their long-term impact and the geopolitical contest surrounding them raise questions
about the efficacy of externally influenced democratic transitions.
The Colour Revolutions and Their Geopolitical Significance
The colour revolutions were named for their symbolic associations with specific colours,
Georgia’s Rose Revolution (2003), Ukraine’s Orange Revolution (2004), and Kyrgyzstan’s Tulip Revolution (2005).
These movements were ostensibly organic uprisings against corrupt regimes,
yet they received substantial backing from Western institutions
such as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which was established during the Cold War to promote American political and social values.
Geopolitical Significance of Colour Revolutions
From a Western perspective,
these revolutions
represented a shift towards democracy
and freedom.
Russian elites viewed them as externally orchestrated efforts
to undermine Moscow’s sphere of influence.
British strategist B.H. Liddell Hart’s concept of fighting ‘on the other side of the hill’ aptly describes this indirect approach
, which prioritises destabilisation and political subversion over direct confrontation.
Russia perceived these movements as not only a threat to its neighbouring states
but also as a
potential blueprint for similar uprisings within its own borders.
Beyond the post-Soviet space,
the model of colour revolutions influenced geopolitical strategies in regions such as West Asia, Africa, and South Asia.
Major powers, including Russia and China, saw them as examples of low-cost, high-impact interventions used to realign political landscapes in favour of Western interests.
The Limits of Externally Driven Democracy
Despite the initial optimism surrounding these movements,
their long-term outcomes were far from the idealised vision of corruption-free,
democratic Western allies.
transitions often failed to bring tangible improvements
, and in many cases, one set of corrupt elites was simply replaced by another with Western backing.
Public frustration and disillusionment grew as promised democratic reforms did not materialise
, highlighting the limitations of externally driven democratic experiments.
striking example is Georgia’s Rose Revolution,
which led to the election of Mikheil Saakashvili as president.
While initially celebrated as a victory for democratic values,
his administration soon became associated with corruption, authoritarianism,
and undemocratic practices.
This pattern underscores the difficulty of sustaining democratic gains without robust domestic institutions and grassroots political engagement.
The Resurgence of Political Unrest in Georgia, Russia’s Role, and Influence of Colour Revolutions
Two decades after the Rose Revolution,
Georgia is once again experiencing political turbulence.
Recent elections saw the ruling Georgian Dream party secure a decisive victory
, leading to a transition of power.
the former president, Salome Zourabichvili, initially refused to vacate office
, claiming electoral fraud and corruption.
Her support for street protests
against the new administration
further intensified political instability.
ruling party, in turn, accused Western-backed NGOs of orchestrating these protests
to interfere in Georgia’s internal affairs.
claim aligns with a broader pattern in post-Soviet states,
where opposition movements are often suspected of being proxies for foreign interests.
renewed unrest in Georgia highlights the persistent struggle between pro-Western and pro-Russian factions
within the country, reflecting its geopolitical vulnerability.
Russia’s Role and the Waning Influence of Colour Revolutions
Russia’s geopolitical standing has been
affected by its war with Ukraine,
but it remains a formidable player in the post-Soviet space.
While its focus has shifted towards consolidating influence in its immediate neighbourhood,
the broader narrative of declining Russian power often underestimates its resilience.
At the same time,
global shifts have impacted the effectiveness of Western soft power strategies,
including the promotion of democracy through colour revolutions.
With the U.S. facing internal political challenges
and a recalibration of its foreign policy priorities,
its ability to support such movements has diminished.
This has led to a relative decline in the effectiveness of externally supported democratic transitions in the region.
Georgia’s Strategic Importance in Global Politics
Georgia’s geographic position at the crossroads
of Europe and Asia makes it
a key battleground for geopolitical competition.
Its
historical vulnerabilities have made it susceptible to external influences
, and its political trajectory is shaped by the broader struggle between Western and Russian interests.
country’s challenge lies in balancing domestic governance with external pressures
in an increasingly complex global environment.
fate of Georgia is not just a national issue but a reflection of the larger geopolitical tensions
shaping post-Soviet states.
question remains whether the colour revolution model will continue to be a viable tool for political change
or fade as a relic of early 21st-century geopolitics.
As international relations evolve,
the resilience of states caught between major power struggles will be put to the test.
Conclusion
While colour revolutions initially promised reform and democratisation,
their long-term outcomes have often fallen short of expectations
, leading to public disillusionment.
renewed instability in Georgia serves as a case study of the ongoing geopolitical contest
between East and West.
As global power dynamics shift,
the effectiveness of soft power interventions like the colour revolutions is waning
, leaving post-Soviet states to navigate their political futures in a world where
external influence remains a double-edged sword.

**********Lighten the Pollution Burden of Thermal Power States
Context
In its first updated
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
in August 2022,
India pledged to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 (from 2005 levels)
and achieve 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources.
However, despite this shift,
thermal power continues to hold a significant share in India's electricity production
, accounting for 50% of the total electricity generation.
A critical issue arising from this scenario is the
environmental burden borne by thermal power-producing States,
which generate electricity for other States but receive no compensation for the pollution caused.
Therefore, it is important to examine
the current state of thermal power production in India, the disparity in electricity generation and consumption
, and the necessity of compensating power-producing States for the environmental damage they endure.
The Environmental Burden of Thermal Power
Thermal power plants remain the
dominant
of electricity in India,
relying heavily on coal.
As of April 2023
, India had
378.21 billion tonnes of coal
reserves, with
Odisha alone accounting for 94.52 billion tonnes.
Approximately
59.12% of India's total energy supply is derived from coal
, and in 2022-23, 73.08% of electricity was generated using coal, oil, and natural gas.
The environmental consequences of thermal power generation are severe, with
India recording 20,794.36 kg of carbon emissions from electricity
Power-producing States bear the brunt of this pollution,
as they are responsible for supplying electricity to other States, often at the expense of their own environmental and public health conditions.
Disparity in Electricity Generation and Consumption
Power-Producing vs. Power-Consuming States
Data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for 2022-23 illustrates this divide.
Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat
had the
highest non-renewable electricity generation capacities
, producing 31,510.08 MW, 26,729.374 MW, and 26,073.41 MW, respectively.
At the same time,
Rajasthan led in renewable electricity generation with an installed capacity of 22,398.05 MW.
Despite these figures, some States consume significantly more electricity than they generate, while others sell their surplus electricity to power-deficient States.
Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh
produce substantial amounts of electricity but consume only 40%, 38.43%, and 29.92%, respectively, of their NTPC-generated power.
, despite having a minimal NTPC generation capacity of only 17.7 MW, is the
largest importer
of NTPC-generated electricity, consuming
4,612 MW
Maharashtra and Haryana
are also significant electricity importers, relying on electricity produced by other States.
The Role of Net Exporting and Importing States
An analysis of net electricity exports and imports reveals a concentration of electricity generation in certain regions.
According to NITI Aayog’s 2022-23 data:
was the
highest net seller of electricity
, exporting
535
29 MW
Other significant net electricity exporters included
Madhya Pradesh (379.19 MW), Himachal Pradesh (153.43 MW), Rajasthan (135.14 MW), Odisha (95.40 MW), and Meghalaya (55.22 MW).
On the other hand, certain States are highly dependent on electricity imports:
largest electricity importer
, purchasing
17 MW
from other States.
Other major importers included
Haryana (212.63 MW), Maharashtra (187.50 MW), Delhi (162.97 MW), Punjab (160.82 MW), and Tamil Nadu (128.37 MW).
This pattern demonstrates that industrially and economically developed States, such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, rely on power-producing States to meet their energy demands while facing minimal pollution themselves.
Case Study: Tripura and Bihar
has the
highest share of thermal power in its total electricity generation capacity (96.96%)
, followed closely by
Bihar (95.57%)
However, not all the electricity generated in these States is consumed locally. For example,
Bihar sold 16,529.62 MW of electricity in 2022-23
, indicating that a large portion of its power generation benefits other States rather than its own residents.
The Issue of Lack of Compensation for Power-Producing States
Despite their significant contribution to India's power sector,
thermal power-producing States do not receive any compensation for the pollution they endure.
India’s regulatory structure does not account for the environmental costs
of electricity generation, as taxes and duties are imposed on electricity consumption and sale rather than on production.
Since
electricity falls under the Concurrent List (Entry 38 of List III) of the Constitution
, both central and State governments can legislate on electricity matters.
the Ministry of Power issued a directive in October 2023 prohibiting States from levying additional taxes on electricity generation
, limiting their ability to earn revenue from power production.
Additionally,
electricity is exempt from the Goods and Services Tax (GST),
meaning power-producing States do not benefit from tax revenues associated with electricity distribution.
The Way Ahead to
Ensure Fairness in India’s Power Sector
The Need for a Compensation Mechanism
Taxation on Thermal Power Generation
States hosting central sector power
should be allowed to impose taxes
on thermal power production.
Alternatively,
the Union government could collect and redistribute these tax revenues
to the affected States.
Finance Commission-Based Compensation
The Finance Commission of India can introduce
a structured compensation
mechanism
for power-producing States.
The last three Finance Commissions have already incorporated environmental and climate concerns into their fund allocation strategies.
Sixteenth Finance Commission should further strengthen this approach
by considering India’s international climate commitments and implementing a fiscal roadmap to address environmental burdens.
Conclusion
India’s commitment to a cleaner energy
future must also acknowledge the
disproportionate impact of thermal power generation
on certain States.
imbalance between electricity generation and consumption, coupled with the absence of financial compensation,
places an
unfair burden on power-producing States.
well-structured taxation or Finance Commission-based compensation system is necessary
to ensure that these States receive fair economic support for their role in India’s energy security.

Today’s editorial addresses issues related to thermal power plants. This topic will be useful for GS Paper 2 and 3 in the Mains exam.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
States that produce thermal power should be fairly compensated for handling the pollution caused while generating electricity for other states.
What is the extent of the pollution burden caused by thermal power plants in certain states?
High Concentration of Polluting Power Plants
: States like
Chhattisgarh
Odisha
Jharkhand
, and
Uttar Pradesh
are home to a large share of India’s thermal power plants, contributing significantly to the country’s carbon emissions. These states face disproportionate pollution as they generate much of the power consumed across India but do not benefit equally in terms of electricity consumption.
For example,
produces large amounts of electricity from thermal plants, but its per capita electricity consumption remains much lower than that of economically better-off states like
Gujarat
Maharashtra
Disproportionate Emissions and Air Pollution
: Thermal power generation is a major source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM), contributing heavily to air pollution. States like
, with a high density of coal-based plants, suffer from severe air quality deterioration, leading to health hazards like respiratory diseases.
Externalities from Power Exporting States
: States such as
Madhya Pradesh
are significant net exporters of electricity. Despite being the source of much of India’s thermal power, these states bear the brunt of the pollution without receiving adequate compensation or benefits.
was the highest net exporter of electricity in 2022-23, yet it continues to face the negative environmental impacts without direct benefits.
Impact on Local Health and Environment
: The local populations near thermal power plants suffer from air pollution-induced health issues like
COPD
, asthma, and lung cancer. Additionally, the local environment is negatively impacted due to thermal pollution and the disposal of coal ash.
Bihar
, which generates most of its electricity from thermal plants, residents face health risks due to pollutants emitted by nearby plants, such as
NTPC
‘s plants.
Water and Soil Contamination
: Thermal power plants contribute to thermal pollution in water bodies, affecting aquatic life, and displace harmful chemicals into soil, which degrades agriculture. In coal-rich states like
, this leads to long-term environmental damage.
For instance, the
from thermal plants in
has been found to pollute the soil, reducing agricultural productivity and harming local ecosystems.
What are the environmental and health impacts of this pollution on local populations?
Respiratory and Cardiovascular Diseases
: The emission of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) from thermal power plants significantly degrades air quality. This leads to an increase in respiratory problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
For example, in
, where thermal plants are concentrated, residents face high rates of respiratory illnesses due to prolonged exposure to air pollution from coal-fired power plants.
: The disposal of toxic coal ash and wastewater from thermal power plants pollutes local water bodies and soil, leading to contamination of drinking water sources and agricultural land. This can cause long-term harm to both human health and local ecosystems.
, coal ash from thermal plants has been found to seep into nearby rivers and groundwater, impacting drinking water quality and agricultural productivity.
Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events
: The carbon dioxide (CO₂) emitted by thermal power plants contributes to global warming, leading to more frequent and severe extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and droughts. These events directly affect public health by increasing mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable populations like the elderly and children.
For example, states like
face heightened vulnerability to heatwaves and flooding, worsened by the cumulative impact of pollution from nearby thermal power plants.
What steps can be taken to mitigate the pollution caused by thermal power plants? (Way forward)
Adoption of Cleaner Technologies
: Implementing advanced technologies such as Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD), Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP), and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can significantly reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO₂), particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ). These technologies capture pollutants before they are released into the atmosphere, improving air quality.
Switching to Cleaner Fuels and Renewable Energy Sources
: Gradually transitioning from coal to cleaner energy sources like natural gas, biomass, or renewable energy (solar, wind, and hydro) can help reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants.
Solar power initiatives
in states like
Rajasthan
, which have vast renewable energy capacities, can be expanded to replace coal-based power generation, reducing reliance on thermal plants.
Improved Waste Management and Pollution Control Regulations
: Establishing strict regulations for the management of coal ash and waste from thermal plants can help prevent contamination of water bodies and soil. The use of ash for brick-making and cement production, or proper disposal in landfills, can mitigate environmental hazards.
**********Parliamentary Panel recommends Paddy Residue MSP to curb Stubble Burning
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Pollution related issues; MSP;
Why in the News?
Recently, a parliamentary committee, led by Rajya Sabha MP Milind Deora, has suggested setting a minimum support price (MSP) for paddy residue. This aims to discourage farmers from burning stubble, which is a major cause of air pollution in Delhi.
What were the observations made by the Parliamentary standing committee?
Stubble Burning as a Key Cause of Air Pollution
: The committee acknowledged that stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana significantly contributes to Delhi’s air pollution during winter.
Farmers’ Constraints
: Farmers burn stubble due to a short window (25 days) between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing.
State-wise Disparities
: Punjab generates 16.1 million tonnes of non-basmati paddy straw annually, while Haryana generates only 4.04 million tonnes. Punjab also reported 10,990 stubble-burning incidents in 2023-24, compared to Haryana’s 1,406.
Existing Government Schemes
: The Central government provides subsidies for crop residue management machinery, but high fuel costs make their usage unfeasible for many farmers.
Incentive Gap
: Haryana provides higher financial support (₹7,000/acre for crop diversification, ₹4,000 for direct seeding of rice), whereas Punjab offers only ₹1,500 for direct seeding.
Technological Gaps
: Even after mechanized harvesting, 10-15 cm of stubble remains in fields, which cannot be manually cleared due to labour shortages.
What recommendations were given by the Panel?
Minimum Price for Paddy Residue:
Establish a mechanism to determine a minimum price for paddy residue, similar to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, in consultation with the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). The benchmark price should be announced before the Kharif season to reflect residue collection costs.
Promote Short-Duration Paddy Varieties:
Urge state governments to promote short-duration paddy varieties instead of long-duration ones like PUSA 44.
Unified National Policy:
Implement a unified national policy to integrate agricultural residue into bioenergy generation, ensuring inter-ministerial coordination.
Real-time Forecasting:
Establish real-time mapping of crop acreage and forecasting of crop maturity and weather patterns to estimate land under cultivation and assess district-wise crop yields for better planning.
Storage Facilities:
Set up interim storage facilities in districts where industries or end-users are not available within a 20–50 km range to facilitate efficient crop residue collection and transport.
Incentives and Subsidies:
Provide incentives for the transportation of stubble to discourage in-field burning and subsidize machinery for in-situ paddy straw management. Farmers should get a 50 percent subsidy for machinery and 80 percent for establishing centers for renting out machines for managing paddy straw.
Technological Advancements:
Develop technology that combines the work of harvesters and cutters to completely clear stubble from fields and promote early-maturing crop varieties.
What is Delhi govt’s 20-point Winter Action Plan?
Real-Time Monitoring and Special Task Force:
The plan includes the use of drones for real-time monitoring of pollution hotspots, marking a shift from manual inventory methods. Additionally, a special task force will be formed to oversee pollution control efforts and ensure compliance with regulations across various sectors.
Control Measures for Pollution Sources:
The action plan emphasizes controlling dust pollution through increased water sprinkling, deployment of anti-smog guns, and strict regulations on construction sites. It also addresses vehicular emissions by promoting work-from-home policies and considering the implementation of an odd-even vehicle rationing scheme during high pollution days.
Public Participation and Emergency Measures:
The plan encourages public involvement through campaigns and initiatives aimed at reducing pollution, such as banning firecrackers and promoting eco-friendly practices.
Emergency measures like artificial rain are also proposed to mitigate severe pollution events expected around Diwali and during stubble burning seasons.
Way forward:
Sustainable Agricultural Practices & Farmer Incentives:
Strengthen financial incentives for crop residue management, promote widespread adoption of short-duration paddy varieties, and enhance technological solutions for complete stubble removal to reduce reliance on burning.
Integrated Pollution Control & Public Awareness:
Implement a coordinated air quality management framework involving real-time monitoring, stricter enforcement of emission norms, and large-scale public participation campaigns to promote eco-friendly practices and behavioural change.
Mains PYQ:
Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata are the three Mega cities of the country but the air pollution is much more serious probelm in Delhi as compared to the other two. Why is this so?

**********How did a DDoS attack cripple Kaveri 2.0?
Security Issues
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Cyber attacks;
Why in the News?
In January, the Kaveri 2.0 web portal, which helps with property registrations in Karnataka, experienced frequent server crashes. This caused a major disruption, bringing property registration and related citizen services to a near halt in the state.
What is a DDoS attack?
A
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
attack is when a website or online service is flooded with too much traffic all at once, making it crash or slow down so that real users can’t access it.
Instead of coming from one source, the attack comes from many different computers or devices that have been taken over by attackers. These devices work together to send massive amounts of fake traffic to the target, overwhelming it and causing it to stop working.
What are other major DDoS attacks?
Dyn DDoS Attack (2016):
Dyn DDoS attack
disrupted major websites including Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit. The attack used a
botnet of IoT devices
, such as cameras and routers, to flood Dyn’s servers with traffic, causing widespread outages.
GitHub DDoS Attack (2018):
In 2018,
was hit by one of the
largest DDoS attacks
in history, with traffic peaking at
1.35 terabits per second
. The attack exploited
memcached servers
to amplify the traffic, overwhelming GitHub’s servers before mitigation efforts kicked in.
AWS DDoS Attack (2020):
Amazon Web Services (AWS) faced a
2.3 Tbps DDoS attack
in 2020, which was one of the largest publicly reported DDoS attacks. AWS mitigated the attack using its
cloud infrastructure
and security services like
AWS Shield
Cloudflare DDoS Attack (2021):
thwarted a
26 million request-per-second DDoS attack
, one of the largest HTTPS DDoS attacks at the time. It was mitigated using Cloudflare’s advanced
rate-limiting
traffic filtering
technologies.
Microsoft Azure DDoS Attack (2023):
Microsoft Azure faced one of the largest DDoS attacks ever recorded, peaking at 3.47 terabits per second. The attack, attributed to a botnet leveraging vulnerable devices, aimed to disrupt services for enterprise clients.
What are the steps taken by the Indian Government?
Cybersecurity Regulations and Policies:
In 2025, new cybersecurity regulations were introduced to enhance the existing framework, including mandatory data localization and strengthened data protection laws. The National Cyber Security Policy, established in 2013, continues to guide these efforts by providing strategies for securing cyberspace and protecting critical information infrastructure.
Increased Budget Allocations:
The Union Budget for 2025 allocated over ₹1,600 crore for cybersecurity initiatives, reflecting the government’s recognition of its importance for national security and economic stability. This includes significant funding for CERT-In and capital projects aimed at bolstering cybersecurity infrastructure across various sectors.
Formation of Cybersecurity Agencies:
The establishment of agencies such as CERT-In (Computer Emergency Response Team) and NCIIPC (National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre) has been crucial.
These agencies are responsible for monitoring cyber threats, coordinating responses, and enhancing the security of critical sectors like banking, telecommunications, and energy.
Skill Development Initiatives:
To address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals, the government has launched skill development programs aimed at training a workforce of over 500,000 IT experts. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to create a resilient cyber ecosystem capable of responding to evolving threats.
How can such attacks be mitigated? (Way forward)
Traffic Filtering & AI-Based Detection:
Uses firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and AI-based threat analysis to filter out malicious traffic before it reaches the target server.
Example:
Google Cloud Armor helped mitigate a 46 million request-per-second (RPS) DDoS attack in 2022 by detecting abnormal traffic patterns and blocking it in real-time.
Rate Limiting & Load Balancing:
Restricts the number of requests a user can make in a given timeframe and distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.
Cloudflare’s Rate Limiting and Load Balancer mitigated an HTTP flood attack on a European banking institution, ensuring legitimate users were not affected.
Bot Detection & CAPTCHAs:
Uses CAPTCHA tests, behavioural analytics, and browser fingerprinting to block automated bot traffic.
GitHub (2015 DDoS Attack by China-based botnet) introduced CAPTCHA-based protection to prevent automated malicious requests targeting anti-censorship tools.
CDN & Cloud-Based DDoS Protection:
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and cloud-based security providers absorb attack traffic before it reaches the main infrastructure.
Amazon AWS Shield protected against a 2.3 Tbps DDoS attack (2020) by leveraging global CDN distribution and real-time attack mitigation.
Incident Response Plan & Collaboration with Cybersecurity Agencies:
Organizations monitor threats, conduct regular security audits, and coordinate with government agencies for rapid response.
Kaveri 2.0 Attack (2024, Karnataka, India) led to a cybercrime investigation and strengthened security protocols after the portal faced 6.2 lakh malicious requests in two hours.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the potential threats of Cyber attack and the security framework to prevent it.

**********Constitutional morality: the origins and nuances of the concept
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Constitutional morality;
Why in the News?
Recently, our constitutional courts have adopted the concept of “
constitutional morality
” to help interpret laws and decide if they are constitutionally valid.
What is Constitutional Morality?
refers to the set of values, principles, and norms that underlie and guide the functioning of a constitution, ensuring that laws, governance, and judicial decisions align with the foundational ideals of the constitution, such as justice, equality, and the protection of rights.
It emphasizes respect for the rule of law, the adherence to constitutional procedures, and the recognition of constitutional rights, fostering a culture of civic responsibility and public reason.
Key features of Constitutional Morality:
Respect for Constitutional Values
: Adherence to the core principles embedded in the Constitution, including justice, equality, and freedom, even in the face of political pressure or societal trends.
Commitment to Fundamental Rights
: Ensures that the rights of individuals, especially those of marginalized and vulnerable groups, are protected and upheld, regardless of changing societal attitudes.
Judicial Integrity and Autonomy
: Courts use constitutional morality as a guide to interpret laws and adjudicate cases, ensuring decisions reflect the Constitution’s values, even when confronted with controversial issues.
Promotion of Civic Culture
: Encourages citizens to value and respect the Constitution, promoting a culture of self-restraint, responsibility, and participation in democratic processes.
Balancing Tradition and Progress
: Constitutional morality provides a framework for balancing traditional norms with progressive reforms, ensuring that reforms are in line with constitutional principles.
What are the Origins of Constitutional Morality?
The concept was first introduced by British historian George Grote in his book
“A History of Greece,”
where he discussed the reforms of the Athenian Constitution and emphasized the need for civic responsibility to prevent the usurpation of power. He described constitutional morality as a “paramount reverence for the forms of the Constitution”. Grote saw constitutional morality as a rare sentiment that includes freedom and self-restraint.
In the
Indian context,
the term was popularized by
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar,
who stressed its importance in the Indian Constitution to ensure a peaceful and free democracy. Ambedkar recognized that constitutional morality was not a natural sentiment and needed to be established and promoted within the polity.
How Does Constitutional Morality Influence Judicial Interpretation and Governance?
Guiding Judicial Decisions on Fundamental Rights:
Constitutional morality serves as a guide for courts when interpreting and enforcing fundamental rights, especially in cases involving marginalized or vulnerable groups. It ensures that judicial decisions reflect constitutional principles such as equality, dignity, and justice.
Example
: In the
Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India
(2018) case, the Supreme Court invoked constitutional morality to strike down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, decriminalizing consensual same-sex relations.
Balancing Tradition with Progressive Reforms:
Constitutional morality allows the judiciary to balance traditional values with progressive reforms by focusing on the Constitution’s ideals rather than fluctuating public or political opinions.
Sabarimala
case (2018), the Supreme Court used the concept of constitutional morality to allow women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala temple.
Ensuring Adherence to Constitutional Procedures:
Constitutional morality stresses the importance of adhering to constitutional forms, rules, and procedures, ensuring that governance remains within the framework of law and order, and preventing arbitrary or undemocratic practices.
: Judicial scrutiny in matters of electoral integrity, like the
K.K. Verma v. Union of India
case (2009), where the Court reaffirmed that elections must be conducted with strict adherence to constitutional norms, avoiding arbitrary changes to electoral laws.
Facilitating Judicial Oversight and Accountability:
Constitutional morality encourages the judiciary to hold the executive and legislature accountable, ensuring they act in accordance with the Constitution. It allows courts to question and, if necessary, invalidate actions that undermine constitutional principles.
: The
Keshavananda Bharti
case (1973) upheld the “basic structure doctrine,” wherein the Supreme Court ruled that even constitutional amendments cannot alter the Constitution’s basic structure.
Is constitutional morality a safeguard against fluctuating societal trends in law?
Bulwark Against Volatility
: Constitutional morality ensures consistency in legal decisions, protecting fundamental rights and justice, regardless of changing societal trends.
case, the Court used constitutional morality to uphold the dignity of the LGBTQ+ community, despite fluctuating public views on same-sex relations.
Dangerous Weapon
: Critics argue constitutional morality can be used to override public opinion or traditional values, leading to judicial overreach.
case, the Court’s decision to allow women of all ages into the temple sparked controversy, with some claiming it ignored religious customs and societal norms.
Way forward:
Strengthening Civic Education:
Promote widespread understanding of constitutional morality through educational reforms, ensuring citizens are well-informed about the Constitution’s values and their role in upholding them. This can lead to greater respect for constitutional norms and active participation in democratic processes.
Judicial Vigilance and Reform:
Ensure that the judiciary continues to use constitutional morality as a guiding principle in cases of constitutional interpretation, balancing traditional values with progressive reforms. This requires ongoing judicial training and a commitment to upholding the Constitution’s spirit, particularly in times of political or social upheaval.
Mains PYQ:
‘Constitutional Morality’ is rooted in the Constitution itself and is founded on its essential facets. Explain the doctrine of ‘Constitutional Morality’ with the help of relevant judicial decisions.
