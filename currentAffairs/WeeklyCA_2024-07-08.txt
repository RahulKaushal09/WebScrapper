NITI Aayog Panels to Achieve Net-Zero Goal
Source: BS
Why in News?
Recently,
has formed
dedicated multi-sectoral committees
to prepare a
policy design
and
create a roadmap
for achieving its goal of becoming a
net-zero
economy by 2070
.
This has been started 3 years after India declared its goal to become a
net-zero economy by 2070.
What are the Key Focus Areas of the Working Groups Formed by the NITI Aayog?
About:
has formed 6 working groups. These groups will focus on
developing policy formats, working models
, and
transition pathways
for core sectors like macroeconomic implications, climate finance, critical minerals, and
social aspects of energy transition.
It will also form sectoral committees on transport, industry, buildings, power, and agriculture.
The 6 Net-Zero Working Groups:
Macroeconomic Implications:
Examine the implications of net-zero pathways on macroeconomic indicators and suggest aligned monetary and fiscal policies.
Climate Finance:
Estimate India's
needs for mitigation and adaptation, and identify potential sources of finance.
Critical Minerals:
Research and development, domestic manufacturing, and supply chain for critical minerals.
Social Aspects of Energy Transition:
Assess the social impacts of the energy transition and propose mitigating strategies.
Policy Synthesis:
Collate the reports of the sectoral committees and prepare a consolidated policy handbook.
Sectoral Committees:
Devise transition pathways for power, industry, buildings, transport, and agriculture sectors.
Expected Outcomes:
The deadline for all the working groups to
submit their action plans is October 2024.
The NITI Aayog report is expected to become a
policy handbook for all central ministries
for drafting climate-resilient and adaptive policies to achieve India's net-zero target by 2070.
What is Net-Zero Target?
Net Zero
refers to achieving an
overall balance
between
carbon emissions produced
carbon taken out
of the atmosphere.
It is referred to as
carbon neutrality
, which
does not mean
that a country would bring down its emissions to zero.
Further,
absorption of the emissions
can be
increased by creating more carbon sinks
such as forests.
The removal of gases from the atmosphere requires futuristic technologies such as
carbon capture
and storage.
More than 70 countries have promised to become
by 2050.

What are Indiaâ€™s Initiatives to Achieve Net Zero Target?
National Action Plan on Climate Change:
It aims at creating awareness among the representatives of the public, different agencies of the government, scientists, industry and the communities on the threat posed by climate change and the steps to counter it.
India has promised to
cut its emissions to net zero by 2070
at the
Conference of Parties-26 (COP)
Glasgow Summit.
For this India outlined a
5-pronged
'Panchamitra' climate action
target:
Reach
500 GW Non-fossil energy
capacity by 2030.
50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy
Reduction
of total projected
carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes
from now to 2030.
Reduction of the
carbon intensity of the economy by 45% by 2030
, over 2005 levels.
Achieving the target of
net zero emissions by 2070.

What Steps can be Taken by India to Achieve Net-Zero Emission Target?
Enhancing Carbon Sequestration:
India can enhance its
carbon sequestration
potential by expanding its
forest and tree cover
restoring degraded lands, promoting agroforestry, and adopting
low-carbon farming practices
Carbon sequestration can
not only offset emissions but also provide multiple co-benefits such as
biodiversity
conservation, soil fertility improvement
, water security, livelihood support, and disaster risk reduction.
Building Climate Resilience:
India can build its climate resilience by strengthening its
disaster management systems
, improving its early warning and forecasting capabilities, investing in climate-proof infrastructure, developing
climate-smart agriculture
enhancing health care services, and empowering local communities and institutions.
Driving India's Green Transportation Revolution:
There is a need to promote
electric vehicles (EVs)
by establishing a robust charging infrastructure network and offering incentives for EV adoption.
Introducing
innovative public transportation solutions
such as electric buses, shared mobility services, and smart traffic management systems can reduce congestion and emissions.
Climate Smart Agriculture:
encourage sustainable farming practices
by promoting
organic farming, agroforestry,
precision agriculture.
Integrating technology-driven solutions such as
remote sensing
IoT devices
AI-based analytics
can optimise resource utilisation, reduce water consumption, and enhance crop productivity.
International Collaboration:
India can leverage international collaboration by acquiring
advanced clean technologies
through
technology transfer agreements
with developed countries,
securing international climate finance
sharing best practices
with other developing countries.
Drishti Mains Question:
Discuss India's pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2070. Also, discuss the key policy measures and implications of this commitment for India's sustainable development priorities.
