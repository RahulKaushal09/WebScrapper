**********Antimatter
Scientists have detected the heaviest antimatter nucleus ever observed, named antihyper hydrogen-4, in particle accelerator experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York.
This discovery, resulting from over
6 billion collision events
, could offer insights into the fundamental differences between matter and antimatter, helping to explain why the universe is primarily composed of matter despite the equal creation of antimatter during the Big Bang.
What is Antimatter?
Definition:
Antimatter is similar to ordinary matter but with the opposite electric charge, often referred to as "mirror matter."
Examples:
The antimatter counterpart of an electron (which has a negative charge) is the
positron
, which has the same mass as an electron but carries a positive charge.
The antimatter equivalents of protons and neutrons are known as
antiprotons
antineutrons
, respectively.
Collectively, these are known as
antiparticles
Antimatter Formation and Properties:
Creation:
Both matter and antimatter were created in equal amounts during the
However, a slight imbalance allowed more matter to survive, forming the universe as we know it.
Coexistence:
Matter and antimatter cannot exist together for long; they annihilate each other upon contact, releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of
gamma rays
or elementary particles.
Human-made antimatter:
Scientists can create antimatter particles in high-energy environments, such as particle accelerators like the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
operated by
CERN
near Geneva. These collisions simulate the conditions shortly after the Big Bang, allowing the brief creation of antimatter.
Natural antimatter:
Apart from laboratory conditions, antiparticles are also naturally produced sporadically throughout the universe.

**********H1N1
India has reported over 9,000 H1N1 cases and 178 deaths due to influenza A (H1N1), also known as swine flu, by the end of July 2024.
About H1N1 Influenza:
Nature of virus
: It is a
subtype of the Influenza A virus
, commonly known as
. It can infect both humans and pigs, primarily causing respiratory illnesses.
Transmission
: The virus spreads through
respiratory droplets
when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It can also be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces.
Contagious period
: The virus is contagious from the day before symptoms appear until about
four days
after they start. Children and immunocompromised individuals may remain contagious for a longer period.
First case in India
: The first confirmed case of H1N1 in India was reported in May 2009. Since then, the virus has caused several outbreaks, with significant case numbers recorded in 2021, 2022, and 2023.
Current scenario:
Affected states
Punjab (41 deaths), Kerala (34 deaths), and Gujarat (28 deaths)
are the states with the highest mortality rates. The highest number of cases have been reported in Delhi, Gujarat, and Kerala.
Comparison
: The last significant surge occurred in
2022, with 13,202 cases and 410 deaths.
Recent developments:
New Strain
: The Pune-based National Institute of Virology observed that the virus has undergone point mutations, leading to the emergence of a new strain called the
Michigan strain
, which has replaced the previously prevalent
California strain.
This shift is linked to the increased cases and mortality rates observed in 2024.
Mutation impact
: The virulence of the virus has remained largely unchanged, but the mutation has
rendered previous vaccinations less effective
against the new Michigan strain.

**********Great Nicobar Project
Recently, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has assured that the project will not displace or disturb the indigenous tribes and that due consultations with tribal councils were conducted.
About the Great Nicobar Project:
It is a multi-development initiative aimed at the holistic development of Great Nicobar Island, a strategic location in the southern end of the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
It was cleared by the
Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in November 2022
and is part of a broader strategy to enhance India's strategic presence and infrastructure in the region.
The project is expected to be developed over 30 years in a phased manner.
Key objectives
Strategic importance
: The project is designed to counter expansionist activities by neighbouring countries, particularly China, and to safeguard India's maritime interests by
curbing illegal activities
like poaching by the fishers.
Infrastructure development
: The project is valued at
₹72,000 crore
and includes key infrastructure such as the development of an
international container trans-shipment terminal, a greenfield international airport
with dual military-civilian functions,
township development,
and a
450 MVA power plant (gas and solar-based).
Geographical context
Location
: Great Nicobar Island is the southernmost island in the Andaman and Nicobar group, separated from the Andaman Islands by the
Ten Degree Channel
It is also home to
Indira Point,
India's southernmost point, located less than
150 km from Indonesia
Ecosystem
: The island features tropical wet evergreen forests, mountain ranges up to
650 meters high
, and coastal plains.
It also houses two national parks and a biosphere reserve, supporting endangered species like
the leatherback sea turtle.
Impact on Indigenous Tribes
Tribal population
: The island is home to the
Shompen
, a hunter-gatherer tribe, and the
Nicobarese
. An estimated 237 Shompen and 1,094 Nicobarese live in a tribal reserve covering 751 sq km, of which 84 sq km is proposed to be denotified for the project.
Environmental and seismic considerations
Deforestation
: Approximately
13,075 hectares of forest land
, or
about 15%
of the island’s area, is slated for diversion, with nearly
64 lakh trees
expected to be felled.
Seismic risks
: The region is seismically active, having experienced a major earthquake
(9.2 on the Richter scale) in 2004.
Experts suggest a similar event may not occur for another 400-750 years, though smaller quakes are anticipated.
The project will adhere to the National Building Code for earthquake-resistant structures.

**********Unified Pension Scheme
Recently, the Central Government introduced the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), effectively reversing a 21-year-old reform of India's civil services pension system initiated by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.
About the Unified Pension Scheme:
The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) was introduced by the government on August 24, 2024, replacing the 21-year-old National Pension System (NPS) with a structure closely resembling the Old Pension Scheme (OPS).
Key Features of the Unified Pension Scheme:
Guaranteed pension:
It promises government employees
50% of their last drawn pay
as a lifelong monthly pension.
Dearness relief:
The pension includes a
periodic dearness relief hike
in line with inflation trends.
Family pension:
In the event of a government employee’s death, the family is assured a pension equivalent to
60% of the employee’s pension
Superannuation payout:
lump sum payment
in addition to
gratuity benefits
will be provided at the time of retirement.
Minimum pension:
A minimum pension of
₹10,000 per month
is assured for those who complete at least
10 years of central government service
Contributions under the UPS:
The scheme is
contributory
, requiring:
Employees
to contribute
10% of their salary
is to contribute
5% of the salary
The government’s contribution may be adjusted based on
periodic actuarial assessments
to ensure the scheme's sustainability.
Transition from NPS to UPS:
National Pension System (NPS):
Originally implemented for employees joining on or after January 1, 2004, the NPS linked pension payouts to the accumulated contributions from both the government and employees, invested in market-linked securities.
Switch option:
Employees who joined after 2004, including retirees, have the option to switch from NPS to UPS, which is expected to be beneficial for approximately
99% of NPS members

**********Unified Pension Scheme
Why in news?
The Union Cabinet has approved a new Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for Central government employees, offering an assured pension of 50% of the average salary drawn over the last 12 months of service.
The UPS is similar to the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) and guarantees government employees a lifelong monthly pension of 50% of their last drawn salary.
This scheme will be optional for existing employees under the National Pension System (NPS).
What’s in today’s article?
Difference between NPS and OPS
About
OPS offers pensions to government employees on the basis of their last drawn salary.
50% of the last drawn salary
The attraction of the Old Pension Scheme lay in its promise of an assured or ‘defined’ benefit to the retiree. It was hence described as a ‘
Defined Benefit Scheme
’.
E.g., if a government employee’s basic monthly salary at the time of retirement was Rs 10,000, she would be assured of a pension of Rs 5,000.
Also, like the salaries of government employees,
the monthly pay-outs of pensioners also increased with hikes in dearness allowance or DA announced by the government for serving employees
The OPS was discontinued by the Central government in 2003.
Concerns with the OPS
The main problem was that the
pension liability remained unfunded
— that is,
there was no corpus specifically for pension
, which would grow continuously and could be dipped into for payments.
The Government of India budget provided for pensions every year; there was no clear plan on how to pay year after year in the future.
The ‘pay-as-you-go’ scheme created
inter-generational equity issues
— meaning the present generation had to bear the continuously rising burden of pensioners.
Recently, RBI red-flagged the return to the OPS by some states as a major fiscal concern.
Several states, including Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan have announced a return to the OPS.
In this regard, the RBI said “
by postponing current expenses to the future, states risk accumulation of unfunded pension liabilities in the coming years
”.
New Pension Scheme (NPS)
As a substitute of OPS, the NPS was introduced by the Central government in
April, 2004
This pension programme is open to employees from the
public
private
and even the
unorganised
sectors
except those from the armed forces.
The scheme encourages people to invest in a pension account at regular intervals during the course of their employment.
After retirement, the subscribers can take out a certain percentage of the corpus.
The beneficiary receives the remaining amount as a monthly pension, post-retirement.
Nodal agency:
Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)
The Old Pension Scheme is a pension-oriented scheme. It offers regular pensions to employees during retirement.
Thus, in OPS,
the pension amount is constant
and guaranteed.
On the other hand, the National Pension Scheme is an investment cum pension scheme.
Therefore, NPS doesn’t guarantee fix returns as it is subjected to market volatility.
i.e., in NPS,
contributions are defined, but benefits depend on the market
The government announced the new Unified Pension Scheme (UPS), reversing a 21-year-old civil services pension reform.
It offers an assured pension of 50% of the average salary drawn over the last 12 months of service.
Key features
Effective from April 1, 2025, the scheme will be available to employees with at least 25 years of service.
It will include benefits such as:
a minimum pension of ₹10,000 for those with at least 10 years of service,
inflation-linked adjustments, and
a family pension of 60% of the employee’s pension after their death.
The government will increase its contribution to the
pension corpus from 14% to 18.5% of the basic pay and dearness allowance
, while the employee contribution will remain at 10%.
The scheme allows for a lump sum withdrawal at retirement and
divides the pension corpus into two parts for investment, with a guaranteed pension based on a default investment mode
It will be optional for existing employees under the National Pension System (NPS.)

**********India To Be Free of Naxalism By 2026
Why in news?
Union Home Minister Amit Shah declared that the final battle against Maoists is imminent and will be ruthless, with the goal of eradicating Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) in India by March 2026.
After a meeting in Raipur with officials from Chhattisgarh and neighboring states, the minister emphasized the need for a strong strategy to deliver a decisive blow to LWE, which he described as the biggest challenge to India's democracy.
What’s in today’s article?
India To Be Free Of Naxalism By 2026
Left Wing Extremism (LWE)
Left-wing extremism is the single internal security threat that affects the largest number of States in India.
LWE aims to
overthrow the existing democratic state structure with violence
as their primary weapon, and mass mobilization and strategic united fronts as complementary components.
They plan to usher in So-called ‘
New Democratic Revolution’
Left-wing extremists are popularly known as Maoists worldwide and as Naxalites in India.
Reasons for the spread of LWE
Land Related Factors:
Encroachment and occupation of Government and Community lands (even the water-bodies) by powerful sections of society.
Lack of title to public land cultivated by the landless poor.
Poor implementation of laws prohibiting the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals in the Fifth Schedule areas.
Non-regularisation of traditional land rights.
Displacement and Forced Evictions:
Eviction from lands traditionally used by tribals.
Displacements caused by irrigation and power projects without adequate arrangements for rehabilitation.
Large scale land acquisition for ‘public purposes’ without appropriate compensation or rehabilitation.
Livelihood Related Causes:
Lack of food security – corruption in the Public Distribution System
Disruption of traditional occupations and lack of alternative work opportunities.
Deprivation of traditional rights in common property resources.
Social Exclusion:
Denial of dignity.
Continued practice, in some areas, of untouchability in various forms.
Poor implementation of special laws on prevention of atrocities, protection of civil rights and the abolition of bonded labour etc.
Governance Related Factors:
Corruption and inadequate provision/non-provision of essential public services including primary health care and education.
Misuse of powers by the police and violations of the norms of law.
Perversion of electoral politics and unsatisfactory working of local government institutions.
Current LWE situation in India
Maoist violence came down
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs:
Maoist violence in the country has gone down by 77% since 2010;
The number of resultant deaths (security forces + civilians) has come down by 90 % from the all-time high of 1,005 in 2010 to 98 in 2022.
Number of districts declared to be Naxal-affected
The government has cut the number of districts declared to be Naxal-affected from over 200 in the early 2000s to just 90 now.
It claims that the geographical spread of violence is actually restricted to just 45 districts.
According to the MHA, the arc of violence has been considerably restricted with just 25 districts accounting for 90% of the LWE violence.
The presence of Naxals is said to be minimal to zero in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bihar, which were at one time their strongholds.
Response by Centre
Different schemes to support LWE states
Security Related Expenditure (SRE)
- focuses on equipping security forces to fight Maoists;
The Special Infrastructure Scheme
(SIS) - aims to strengthen local police and intelligence set ups;
Special Central Assistance
for building infrastructure such as roads in LWE districts.
Massive presence of the CRPF
The Centre has maintained a massive presence of the CRPF in the affected states for almost two decades.
Erection of mobile towers
Centre is pushing for the erection of mobile towers in the interiors, which would help the local people connect with the mainstream, and also generate technical intelligence.
Maoists sympathisers on the radar of Centre
The Centre has also unleashed the counter-terrorism National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Enforcement Directorate on CPI(Maoist) cadres, leaders, and sympathisers with the aim to choke their funding.
About the news
Union Home Minister Amit Shah has set a target to eliminate Maoist activities in India by March 2026.
He emphasized the need for a strong and ruthless strategy for the final assault against these groups.
Decline in Maoist violence
The minister highlighted the significant decline in Maoist violence over the past decade, with incidents dropping by 53% and related deaths by 70%.
The number of LWE-affected districts has decreased from 96 to 45, and the number of LWE-hit police stations has reduced from 495 to 176.
Factors behind this decline
The minister noted the government’s efforts to address the security vacuum in LWE-affected areas through coordinated operations and development work.
He credited the joint efforts of state and Central Armed Police Forces, the National Investigation Agency, and the Enforcement Directorate for their role in combating Maoist extremism.
The Home Ministry's LWE Division, established in 2006, plays a crucial role in this effort, monitoring the situation and implementing countermeasures.

**********Why is Sanction for Prosecution Needed?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Legal Framework (CRPC, PCA, Role of Governor, Judicial Interpretation, etc.)
Background:
Sanction for prosecuting a public servant is a crucial legal requirement designed to protect officials from frivolous or malicious lawsuits.
This ensures that decisions made during their official duties are not constantly challenged in court without valid grounds.
The need for sanction is embedded in various legal provisions, including Section 197 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure
(CrPC) and Section 19 of the
Prevention of Corruption Act
(PCA).
Legal Framework:
CrPC and PCA
Both these laws require that before a public servant can be prosecuted, a competent authority must grant permission.
This is to ensure that the actions of public servants, especially those undertaken in their official capacity, are scrutinized before legal action is initiated.
Recent Amendments
Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita
(BNSS), which replaced the CrPC, retains the sanction provisions.
In 2018, amendments to the PCA introduced the necessity of obtaining government approval even to start an investigation, highlighting the importance of sanction before prosecuting public servants.
Role of the Governor in Cases Against a Chief Minister:
The Governor plays a significant role in cases involving the Chief Minister.
Since the Governor has the authority to dismiss a CM, they are also the one to grant prosecution sanctions against them.
However, there has been debate over whether the Governor should act independently or based on the advice of the Council of Ministers.
Supreme Court's Stance
In the case of A.R. Antulay, the Supreme Court clarified that the Governor should exercise discretion and not merely follow the Council’s advice when deciding on prosecution sanctions against a CM.
This discretionary power is particularly important in maintaining the balance of power and ensuring justice.
Judicial Interpretations:
There have been instances where Governors have exercised their discretion to grant sanctions despite the Council of Ministers' advice.
For example, in a notable Madhya Pradesh case, the
Supreme Court upheld the Governor's decision to grant sanction against Ministers, even when the Council of Ministers found no grounds for prosecution
The Court emphasized that in cases where the Council’s decision appears biased or irrational, the Governor is justified in acting independently.
Conclusion:
Sanction for prosecution is a critical safeguard in the Indian legal system, ensuring that public servants are not subjected to unnecessary legal harassment
At the same time, it holds them accountable when there is legitimate evidence of wrongdoing.
The role of the Governor, particularly in cases involving high-ranking officials like the Chief Minister, is vital in maintaining this balance.
The judicial backing for the Governor's discretionary powers reinforces the importance of an impartial and fair legal process.
