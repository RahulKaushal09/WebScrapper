What is Prime Minister’s Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM-WANI) Scheme?
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has recommended capping Internet tariffs for Wi-Fi service providers under the PM-WANI scheme at twice the rate for retail broadband.
About PM-WANI Scheme:
It was launched by the
Department of Telecommunication
in 2020.
It aims to
enhance the proliferation of public WiFi hotspots
to create robust digital communications infrastructure in the country, especially in rural areas.
Through better access to public hotspots, the government aims to
increase employment for small and micro-entrepreneurs and provide low-cost internet
to the underserved urban poor and rural households.
The scheme
encourages local shops and establishments to provide Wi-Fi
for last-mile internet delivery, which
does not require a licence or charge a registration fee
How can one get access the PM-WANI internet?
To access public hotspots under the PM-WANI scheme, one
needs to download a relevant app
which shows the available networks.
The user can then
choose from a list of available connections
make a payment
to use the network.
The user can access the network till his/her balance is exhausted.

**********What is Huntington’s Disease (HD)?
New Research uncovers delayed effects of genetic mutation in Huntington's Disease development.
About Huntington’s Disease (HD):
It is a
genetic condition
that
affects the cells in the brain
It affects the cells in
parts of the brain that regulate voluntary movement and memory
What causes Huntington’s disease?
genetic mutation of the HTT gene
causes Huntington’s disease.
The
HTT gene makes
protein called huntingtin.
This protein
helps
the nerve cells (
neurons) function
HD is caused by the
misfolding of the huntingtin
. The misfolding is due to the mtation.
If someone has HD, her/his DNA does not have all the information needed to make the huntingtin protein.
As a result, these
proteins grow in an abnormal shape

How common is HD?
Huntington’s disease affects an estimated 3 to 7 out of every 100,000 people,
most often people of European ancestry
(biological family comes from European descent).
Symptoms
Common symptoms include
uncontrollable dance-like movements (chorea
) and
abnormal body postures
, as well as
problems with behavior, emotion, thinking, and personality.
Other symptoms may include
tremor
(unintentional back-and-forth movement in the person's muscles) and
unusual eye movements
. The eye movements can happen early in the disease.
These symptoms
get worse over time.
As HD progresses
, it
will need constant assistance
and supervision because of the debilitating nature of the disease.
People usually die
from the disease
within 15 to 20 years of developing symptoms
Treatment
There is
no treatment
that can stop or reverse
HD, but health care providers can offer medications to help with certain symptoms.
Drugs like haloperidol, tetrabenazine
amantadine
are especially helpful for
controlling the unusual movements
caused by Huntington disease.

**********An Alliance of Democracies, With India at its Core
Context
The
year 2024, marked by critical elections worldwide
, set the stage for 2025 to become a pivotal moment for democracies to regroup and strengthen their alliances.
Among these,
the relationship between Europe and India stands out as an essential partnership
that has long been rich in strategies but
poor in tangible outcomes.
Both entities must seize the opportunity to redefine their collaboration
, focusing on practical measures that align economic, technological, and security interests.
The First Step Towards Redefining EU-India Relations
Moving Beyond Trade Negotiations
For nearly two decades, EU-India relations have been primarily defined by the pursuit of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA),
with little progress to show.
While such an agreement between the world’s largest democracy and the EU,
the largest trading bloc, could be transformative, hurdles persist.
focus must shift from the technicalities of trade negotiations to higher-level strategic priorities.
These
include economic security, defence cooperation, and partnerships in emerging technology and critical industries
like pharmaceuticals and space exploration.
A Shared Understanding of Geopolitical Realities
India's historical ties with Russia
and pragmatic engagement with China
have often frustrated Europe,
especially in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
However,
India's approach reflects its broader aim to avoid being drawn into the binary division
of democratic versus autocratic blocs.
While its democratic foundations make its alignment with Moscow and Beijing seem incongruous,
Europe must acknowledge its own double standards
, particularly its economic reliance on China.
A reset in EU-India relations requires a shared understanding of the challenges
posed by the Russia-China partnership.
Both are strategic threats to the global democratic order
, making it imperative for India, Europe, and the United States to align their priorities.
Recognising the interconnectedness of events in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, Europe and India must take concrete steps
to enhance trade and security while reducing dependence on China.
Some Other Crucial Areas for India-EU Cooperation
Strengthening Defence and Security
India’s strong defence ties with the United States,
particularly as a ‘Major Defence Partner’ and member of the Quad,
provide a model for Europe.
The EU should enhance its own defence collaboration with India,
offering advanced technologies and investments in place of Russia’s outdated options.
Appointing a dedicated EU Defence Commissioner to engage with India could accelerate progress
in this domain.
Space exploration is another area
of potential cooperation, given the ambitious plans of both the EU and India.
By
developing joint ventures and shared investments in this field, the partnership can achieve significant breakthroughs
, further solidifying their strategic alignment.
Leveraging Technology Collaboration
establishment of the EU-India Trade and Technology Council (TTC) mirrors similar initiatives with the United States,
such as the U.S.-India Critical and Emerging Technology initiative (iCET).
These frameworks are essential for coordinating technology agendas and tackling global challenges,
particularly in emerging technologies like quantum computing and advanced biotech.
competition in these sectors is intense, with China leading in 57 of the top 64 emerging technologies
, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
India and Europe, alongside the U.S., must pool resources
and expertise
to maintain their competitive edge.
focusing on collaborative research and innovation, these democratic partners can position themselves as global leaders
in critical technologies.
The Way Forward to a Robust EU-India Partnership
Strengthening Economic Ties
economic potential of an EU-India partnership is immense
India is on track to become the world’s third-largest economy
in the next decade, offering a dynamic market for European businesses seeking growth beyond their borders.
Conversely,
Europe’s advanced industrial capabilities and access to cutting-edge technology provide India with opportunities to modernise its economy
and industries.
To facilitate these opportunities, both parties must break down barriers
to trade and investment.
EU and India should prioritise sectors with mutual benefits
, such as green energy, pharmaceuticals, advanced manufacturing, and digital innovation.
Deepening Cultural and Educational Exchanges
Europe and India must enhance cultural, academic, and professional exchanges
to build trust and mutual understanding.
Programs that promote student and faculty exchanges between European and Indian universities can create a generation of leaders
with firsthand knowledge of both regions.
Similarly, professional training programs and labour mobility agreements can address skills gaps in Europe
while providing employment opportunities for India’s vast pool of talented professionals.
Facilitating visa access and streamlining processes
for work and study permits
will further encourage these exchanges.
Enhancing Collaboration on Global Challenges
The EU and India share common concerns about climate change, public health, and global security,
making collaboration on these issues a practical necessity.
For example,
joint initiatives in renewable energy development can help accelerate the transition to a green economy.
Europe’s leadership in clean technologies, coupled with India’s ambitious renewable energy targets
, offers a perfect opportunity for collaboration.
In public health,
the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of global partnerships in developing and distributing vaccines.
India, as a pharmaceutical manufacturing powerhouse, and Europe
, with its strong research and regulatory infrastructure,
can work together to improve global health security.
Creating a Model Partnership
The ultimate goal of building practical connections is to create a model partnership
that other democracies can emulate.
By demonstrating how regions with different historical and cultural contexts can work together effectively,
Europe and India can inspire other nations to forge similar alliances.
In this effort, both sides must commit to regular engagement at all levels
—political, economic, and social.
High-level summits, business forums, and cultural festivals should be complemented by grassroots initiatives
that connect communities and individuals.
This
multi-level approach will ensure that the EU-India partnership is not just a strategic alliance but a living, dynamic relationship grounded in mutual respect
and shared aspirations.
Bridging Democratic Challenges
Both Europe and India face challenges
in maintaining and
strengthening their democratic institutions.
By working together, they can learn from each other’s experiences
and develop strategies to address issues like polarization, misinformation, and the erosion of civil liberties.
orums for democratic dialogue, including joint research initiatives
and policy workshops,
can create mutual learning and innovation in democratic governance.
Conclusion
Europe, India, and the United States are individually influential, but their collective power is unparalleled
in countering autocratic forces.
By prioritising strategic cooperation in defence, technology
, and economic security, the
EU-India partnership can evolve into a cornerstone of global democratic stability.
This is
not just a necessity for these regions but a vital step in shaping a future where democracies lead the way.

**********Causes, Implications and Policy Challenges of the Devaluation of the Indian Rupee
Why in News?
The Indian rupee recently witnessed a sharp devaluation against the dollar after a period of relative stability post-COVID.
This article examines India’s exchange rate policies, structural constraints in the economy, and the broader implications of rupee depreciation.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Understanding Exchange Rate Regimes
India’s Exchange Rate Policy
Implications of Rupee Devaluation
Structural Constraints in the Indian Economy
Policy Questions and Challenges
Conclusion
Understanding Exchange Rate Regimes:
Nominal and Real Exchange Rates:
The nominal exchange rate is the official exchange rate that doesn't account for inflation, while the real exchange rate is the nominal exchange rate adjusted for inflation.
Determinants of Exchange Rates:
Current Account:
Influenced by net exports.
Capital Account:
Driven by foreign investment flows.
Impact:
Demand for foreign currency increases with a higher current account deficit and capital outflow.
Types of Exchange Rate regimes:
Fixed Exchange Rate:
Central bank maintains a constant exchange rate by managing reserves.
Floating Exchange Rate:
Market-driven exchange rate with no central bank intervention.
Managed-Floating Exchange Rate:
A mix of market forces and central bank intervention.
India’s Exchange Rate Policy:
Past trends:
India has primarily followed a managed-float regime for three decades.
From 2010, the RBI managed the rupee asymmetrically:
Under excess demand:
Depreciated the rupee and sold foreign reserves.
Under excess supply:
Accumulated reserves to avoid appreciation.
Post-COVID shifts:
Between 2022 and late 2024, the RBI temporarily adopted a fixed exchange rate-like regime to stabilize the rupee.
Recent sharp devaluation suggests a return to the managed-float approach, driven by:
Capital outflows.
Rising import costs amid high crude oil prices.
Implications of Rupee Devaluation:
Positive effects:
Boosting exports:
Depreciation can make domestic goods cheaper, enhancing export competitiveness if:
Net exports respond positively to a weaker real exchange rate.
Nominal depreciation leads to real depreciation.
Adverse effects:
Inflationary pressures:
Increased import costs raise domestic prices.
Reduced purchasing power:
Firms pass on higher costs to consumers, squeezing real incomes.
Structural Constraints in the Indian Economy:
Divergence between NEER and REER:
These indices reflect the
weighted average exchange rate of India with respect to its multiple trade partners
According to the definitions of these indices, any increase or positive change indicates appreciation, whereas any drop or negative change indicates depreciation.
Since the mid-2010s
, the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) has depreciated, while the real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated.
This divergence undermines export competitiveness
, as higher domestic prices offset the benefits of nominal depreciation.
Rising markups:
Non-financial firms have increased markups (ratio of output price to variable costs), contributing to domestic price inflation.
Key cost drivers include raw materials, labor, fuel, and indirect taxes.
Policy Questions and Challenges:
Policy dilemmas:
Should India revert to the managed-float regime of the 2010s or adopt a new framework?
How can policy address inflationary pressures while maintaining export competitiveness?
RBI’s role:
The RBI’s recent ad hoc policy shifts highlight the need for a systematic exchange rate strategy.
Clearer objectives and consistent communication are essential for addressing current challenges.
Conclusion:

Polity & Governance
**********An alliance of democracies with India at its core
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Democratic countries;
Why in the News?
Europe and India need a stronger, more practical partnership and together with the United States, they can become an unbeatable force.
Why do all democratic countries need to come together?
Unified Front Against Authoritarianism
: Democracies can counter coercive tactics and aggression from authoritarian regimes like China and Russia by standing together to deter threats to vulnerable nations, and reinforcing global stability.
Advocating Democratic Principles
: A collective alliance provides a platform to promote democratic values such as human rights, the rule of law, and free markets fostering an international environment supportive of democracy.
Addressing Global Challenges Collaboratively
: Democracies can pool resources and expertise to tackle global issues like climate change, terrorism, and public health crises through joint strategies and initiatives.
Strengthening Economic Ties
: Enhanced economic cooperation within an alliance can promote free trade, reduce barriers, and create a resilient network to counter economic coercion from non-democratic states.
Bolstering Democratic Resilience
: By sharing best practices, democracies can strengthen their institutions, address internal polarisation, and enhance resilience against threats to their democratic systems.
What is the strategic importance of India in a global alliance of democracies?
Geopolitical Counterbalance:
India serves as a crucial counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific region.
As a democracy with significant economic growth potential, India’s alignment with European democracies can help counter authoritarian influences, particularly from Russia and China, which pose threats to global democratic norms.
Economic Partnership:
The EU-India relationship is economically significant, with India projected to become the world’s third-largest economy in the next decade.
Strengthening trade ties can enhance economic security for both parties and reduce dependency on China. The EU has recognised India as a ‘Trusted Partner’ in critical sectors such as technology and pharmaceuticals.
Shared Values:
Both Europe and India share foundational values of democracy, rule of law, and human rights. This commonality provides a strong basis for collaboration on global issues such as climate change, security, and sustainable development.
How can India contribute to the promotion and protection of democratic norms internationally?
Promoting Democratic Values:
India can advocate for democratic governance and human rights on international platforms, leveraging its status as the world’s largest democracy to influence other nations positively.
Collaborative Initiatives:
Through partnerships like the Trade and Technology Council (TTC), India can collaborate with Europe on emerging technologies and critical industries.
Such cooperation can promote transparency and ethical standards in technology development.
Defense Cooperation:
India’s existing defense collaborations with the U.S. and its role in multilateral security frameworks like the Quad can be expanded to include European partners, enhancing collective security against authoritarian regimes.
What challenges does India face in leading or participating in this alliance?

India’s historical ties with Russia complicate its position within a democratic alliance. While it seeks to maintain these relationships for strategic reasons, it must also navigate criticism from Western allies regarding its stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Internal Democratic Challenges:
India faces significant internal challenges related to its democratic processes, including concerns about political dissent and civil liberties.
Addressing these issues is essential for India to lead effectively within a global democratic alliance.
Trade Negotiation Stagnation:
Ongoing negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and India have faced hurdles due to disagreements over sustainability measures and human rights issues.
Progress in these negotiations is crucial for realizing the full potential of their partnership.
Way forward:
Strengthening Internal Democracy and Rule of Law
: India should address domestic concerns related to political dissent, civil liberties, and democratic processes to enhance its credibility and leadership role within a global democratic alliance.
Expanding Strategic Partnerships
: India should accelerate negotiations on trade agreements, deepen collaboration in critical sectors like technology and defense, and align with democratic allies to counter authoritarian influences effectively.

**********Costly HPV vaccine needs to be part of national immunisation programme
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges to the healthcare sector;
Why in the News?
The HPV vaccine works best if given before coming into contact with the virus. It is recommended for children aged 12 to 13 and for people who are more likely to get HPV.
What are the health benefits of including the HPV vaccine in the national immunization program?
Prevention of Cervical Cancer:
The HPV vaccine can prevent over 90% of cervical cancers caused by HPV, significantly reducing incidence rates and mortality associated with this disease.
Broader Cancer Protection:
Vaccination also protects against other HPV-related cancers, including those of the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, and oropharynx, promoting overall public health.
Cost-Effectiveness:
Early vaccination can lead to long-term savings in healthcare costs by reducing the need for cancer treatments and associated healthcare services.
Equity and Accessibility:
Making the HPV vaccine part of the national immunization program would enhance accessibility for all demographics, particularly in low- and middle-income regions where cervical cancer rates are disproportionately high.
What are the economic implications of integrating the HPV vaccine into the national immunization program?
Healthcare Savings:
By preventing cervical cancer, the integration of the HPV vaccine into the national immunization program can lead to substantial reductions in treatment costs and hospitalizations related to advanced cancer stages.
Increased Productivity:
Healthier populations contribute to economic productivity as fewer individuals suffer from debilitating illnesses that impede work and social engagement.
Investment in Public Health:
Allocating resources for HPV vaccination can enhance public health infrastructure and create a more robust healthcare system capable of addressing other health issues.
What are the barriers to HPV vaccination?
High Vaccine Costs:
The prohibitive cost of HPV vaccines like Gardasil and Cervarix limits their accessibility for many Indian families. Although the indigenous vaccine, CERVAVAC, offers a more affordable alternative, affordability remains a key barrier to widespread vaccination.
Low Awareness Levels:
A significant lack of awareness about HPV and its link to cervical cancer results in poor understanding of the vaccine’s benefits, contributing to low acceptance and coverage rates.
Cultural and Social Stigma:
Cultural taboos around sexual health and reproductive issues discourage parents from vaccinating children, particularly girls, due to misconceptions about the vaccine’s necessity or fears of promoting promiscuity.
Gender Bias in Vaccination Efforts:
The focus on HPV as a women-centric infection leads to insufficient promotion of vaccination among boys and young men, perpetuating gender disparities in healthcare and reducing overall campaign effectiveness.
Policy and Budgetary Constraints:
Despite recommendations for including the HPV vaccine in national immunization programs, delays caused by budgetary limitations and competing health priorities hinder its integration and accessibility.
What strategies can be employed to overcome barriers to HPV vaccination uptake? (Way forward)
Awareness Campaigns:
Implementing educational initiatives to inform communities about the benefits and safety of the HPV vaccine can help dispel myths and cultural stigmas surrounding vaccination.
Subsidizing Costs:
Reducing the financial burden through government subsidies or integrating the vaccine into public health programs can improve accessibility for lower-income populations.
Engaging Healthcare Providers:
Training healthcare professionals to communicate the importance of HPV vaccination effectively can encourage more patients to get vaccinated, particularly among hesitant parents and young adults.
Mains PYQ:
What is the basic principle behind vaccine development? How do vaccines work? What approaches were adopted by the Indian vaccine manufacturers to produce COVID-19 vaccines?

**********McKinsey released Report on Demographic Transition and Depopulation
Prelims Only
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Demographic Transition Theory
Why in the News?
The report,
‘Dependency and Depopulation? Confronting the Consequences of a New Demographic Reality’
, released by
McKinsey Global Institute
, provides a detailed comparative analysis of demographic dynamics in
developed (first wave)
developing (later wave)
countries.
IMPORTANT: What is Demographic Transition Theory?
Demographic transition describes changes in birth and death rates and population age structure as societies develop economically and technologically.
Stage 1:
High birth and death rates result in a stable population.
Stage 2:
Decline in death rates due to improved healthcare and sanitation, causing rapid population growth.
Stage 3:
Falling birth rates slow population growth, influenced by urbanization and access to contraception.
Stage 4:
Low birth and death rates lead to a stable or aging population, reflecting advanced development.
Key Highlights of the McKinsey Report
Two-thirds of humanity
now live in countries with fertility rates below the replacement level of
2.1 children per family
Age structures
are shifting from
pyramids to obelisks
, with a growing elderly population and a shrinking youth demographic.
Populations
in some major economies are projected to
decline
20%-50% by 2100
(UN).
global support ratio
(working-age individuals per senior aged 65 or older) is projected to decline from
6.5 today to 3.9 by 2050
In India, the ratio will fall from
10 workers per senior in 1997
4.6 in 2050
and just
1.9 by 2100
, similar to Japan’s current levels..
Consumption Patterns in India:
India’s share in global consumption
is projected to rise from
9% today to 16% by 2050
, while shares of advanced economies are expected to remain flat or decline.
By 2050, the
share of consumption
by seniors aged
and older will rise from
8% to 15%
, reflecting changing consumer demographics.
percentage of hours
worked by seniors is
projected to increase
2.9% to 5.4%
by 2050 under current trends.
About India’s Diminishing Demographic Dividend
India has
33 years
to fully capitalize on its demographic dividend before its support ratios align with those of advanced economies.
From 1997 to 2023, India’s favorable demographics added
0.7 percentage points per year
to its GDP per capita growth.
This contribution is expected to shrink to
0.2 percentage points per year
through 2050 as the population ages.
India’s support ratio
(working-age individuals per senior) is
significantly, creating greater dependency on fewer workers to support older populations.
By 2050, there will be only
4.6 workers per senior
, down from
is currently
18% of the World Bank’s high-income threshold
, emphasizing the need for faster economic progress to “
get rich before it gets old
.”
Increasing
labor force participation
, particularly among women, and improving worker productivity are
critical
to sustaining economic growth.
Despite rapid progress, India’s worker productivity remains at
$9 per hour
, significantly lower than the
$60 per hour average
in high-income countries.
PYQ:
[2012]
