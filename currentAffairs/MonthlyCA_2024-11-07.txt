Why in News?
Recently, the
United Kingdom (UK)
agreed to cede
sovereignty
of the strategically important
to Mauritius.
However, the UK will continue to exercise
sovereign rights
island.
What are the Key Facts Regarding the Chagos Archipelago?
Geography of the Chagos Archipelago:
It consists of
58 islands
and is located approximately
500 km south
of the Maldives in the
Indian Ocean
History of the Chagos Archipelago:
The
French
were the
first to colonize
Mauritius along with the
Chagos Islands
1715.
In the late
18
century,
the French brought in
slave labour
from
Africa and India
to work in newly established
coconut plantations.
took control of the region in
1814
after the fall of France’s
Napoleon Bonaparte.
1965
, the UK constituted the
British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT)
, of which the Chagos Islands were a central part.
Mauritius’ Claims Over Chagos:
Chagos was attached to
Mauritius,
another British colony in the Indian Ocean, for
administrative purposes.
When
Mauritius gained independence
in 1968,
remained with
Britain,
which gave
Mauritius a 3 million pound grant
for the
"detachment."
Strategic Importance of Chagos and Diego Garcia:
1966
, Britain signed an agreement with the
United States
to use the BIOT for military purposes.
Subsequently, the
on Diego Garcia was
shut down
and it became unlawful for a person to enter or remain in Diego Garcia without a permit.
Diego Garcia, the largest in the archipelago, became a fully operational military base in
1986.
It was a key location in the US overseas
“war on terror”
operations following
al-Qaeda’s
September 11 attacks
on the US in 2001.
International Pressure on the UK:
In 2019, the
International Court of Justice (ICJ)
issued an
advisory opinion
that asked the United Kingdom to
unconditionally withdraw i
ts colonial administration from the area within
six months
The ICJ ruled that the
1965 detachment
of Chagos from Mauritius before its independence was
illegal.
What are the Key Details of the UK-Mauritius Agreement?
Sovereignty Over Chagos:
The deal grants Mauritius
full sovereignty
over the archipelago except
Resettlement of Chagossians:
Mauritius can now
resettle people
on the Chagos Archipelago, except Diego Garcia, where
Britain evicted 2,000 islanders
for a US naval base.
Trust Fund:
The UK has also promised to create a
new trust fund
for the benefit of the people of Chagos.

Rare Rain in the Sahara Desert
Source: BS
Recently, a rare
deluge of rainfall
has
flooded
palm trees and
sand dunes
of the
Sahara desert
in Morocco.
The rain was triggered by the
northward shift
Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
, which has moved further north than usual, resulting in
equatorial-like downpours
in the Sahara.
ITCZ has produced a powerful
extratropical cyclone
that swept through northwestern Africa.
An extra-tropical cyclone is a
low-pressure system
which develops in latitudes
outside the tropics
which can bring heavy rainfall.
Repositioning of ITCZ may be linked to
record-high ocean temperatures
climate change.
Sahara Desert:
It is the
world's largest hot desert
having a
length of approximately 4,800 km
and a maximum
width of 1,800 km.
It occupies about
31%
of the entire
African continent.
It stretches among
11 North African nations
including Algeria, Egypt, Mali, Morocco, Western Sahara, Tunisia, Chad, Libya, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan.

Volcanic Eruption and Ionospheric Disturbances
Source: PIB
Why in News?
Recently, a new study revealed a
connection
between the
Tonga volcano
eruption
and the formation of
Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs)
over the Indian subcontinent.
Tonga volcano is a
submarine volcano
in the South Pacific Ocean.
What are the Key Highlights of the Study?
Volcanic Eruption and Space Weather:
The Tonga eruption triggered
ionospheric disturbances
, contributing to space weather events that affect
satellite signals
Atmospheric Gravity Waves:
The eruption produced strong
atmospheric gravity waves
that propagated into the upper atmosphere triggering favourable ionospheric conditions for the formation of EPBs.
Atmospheric gravity waves form when
buoyancy pushes air upward, and gravity pulls it back down
Plasma Instabilities:
Plasma blobs
, an increase in the ionospheric eastward
electric field at dusk
were detected, indicating further ionospheric disturbances due to the eruption.
What are Key Points about Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs)?
About EPBs:
EPBs are ionospheric phenomena that are generated through
plasma instabilities
, particularly in the equatorial
ionosphere
EPBs are regions of
depleted plasma
in the ionosphere that form near the
magnetic equator
during post-sunset hours.
EPBs originate in the equatorial ionosphere but can
extend
, affecting the global ionosphere
15° North and South of the Earth's
Impact on Radio Wave Propagation:
As radio waves propagate through the ionosphere,  irregularities associated with EPBs can
scatter them, leading to signal degradation.
It is a major concern for communication systems that rely on
high-frequency
, such as satellite communications and GPS.
Seasonal and Regional Variability:
EPBs are most frequent during the
Winter solstice
(21
or 22
December)
least frequent during the
Summer solstice
June)
What are Key Facts About the Tonga Volcano?

Cyclone Dana
Source: DTE
Why in News?
According to the
India Meteorological Department (IMD)
,
is expected to make
landfall
as a
severe cyclone (wind speed: 89 to 117 kmph)
along the
Odisha coast
near
Bhitarkanika National Park
Dhamra Port
.
What are Key Facts About Cyclone Dana?
About:
Emergence:
It is the third cyclone to form in the
North Indian Ocean region
and the second to make
along the Indian coast in 2024 after
Cyclone Remal
It is the first cyclone in the
post
monsoon
season.
Naming of Dana:
The
World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)
states that Cyclone Dana was named by
Qatar
. In Arabic, "Dana" signifies
'generosity'
and also refers to 'the most perfectly sized, valuable, and beautiful pearl.'
Reasons for Intense Rainfall:
Intense Convection:
The cyclone is showing
intense
convection
in its western sector, which extends up to the upper layers of the
atmosphere
Intense convection begins when
warm, moist air rises, cools, and expands
, causing moisture to condense into
water droplets and form clouds
As the
rising air continues
to cool and condense, it forms
cumulonimbus clouds
, typical of
thunderstorms
and creates conditions conducive to
heavy rainfall
Warm Moist Air:
There is an
influx of warm, moist air into the core of the cyclone,
which further
enhances convection
leading to more intense rainfall.
The influx of warm, moist air helps to
maintain and intensify the cyclone
and enhances the cyclone's strength which results in intense rainfall over a relatively small area.
Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) Influence:
Currently, MJO is
conducive for convection
hence heavy rainfall.
is made up of
two parts
: an
enhanced rainfall phase
suppressed rainfall phase
During the
enhanced phase
, surface
winds converge
air to rise and create more rainfall
. In the suppressed phase, winds converge at the top of the atmosphere, causing air to sink and leading to less rainfall.
This dipole structure
moves west to east in the Tropics
, creating more
cloudiness and rainfall
phase, and more
sunshine
dryness in the suppressed phase
What Factors are Responsible for Formation of Tropical Cyclones?
Warm Ocean Waters:
Sea surface temperatures of at
least 27°C
are essential for tropical cyclone development. Warm water provides the
heat and moisture
needed to fuel the
storm's rising air and convection process
Coriolis Force:
Coriolis effect
caused by Earth's rotation, is necessary to give the cyclone its
spin
. This force is
weak near the equator
, so tropical cyclones generally form at
least 5° north or south of the equator
Low Wind Shear:
Low vertical
wind shear
(the difference in wind speed and direction at different altitudes) is crucial. High wind shear can disrupt the vertical structure of the storm, preventing it from strengthening .
Pre-existing Disturbance:
A tropical disturbance, such as a
low-pressure system,
provides the initial organisation of
air circulation
around which a cyclone can form.
Convergence of Air:
The convergence of
warm, moist air at the surface
, which rises and cools, creating
clouds and thunderstorms
, is fundamental to developing the cyclone's core.

What are the Impacts of Cyclone?
Human Impact
: Cyclones can cause
widespread casualties
due to strong winds, storm surges, and
flooding
. Thousands of people may be
evacuated or displaced
, leading to temporary or permanent loss of homes.
Infrastructure Loss:
Strong winds can cause
power outages
and structural damage, while flooding
disrupts transportation and communication
Environmental Impact:
High winds and storm surges
erode coastlines, destroying natural habitats
and human structures along the shore.
Cyclones can cause long-term damage to
forests,
wetlands
marine ecosystems
, affecting biodiversity.
Agriculture Loss:
Low-lying agricultural areas are vulnerable to
seawater intrusion
waterlogging f
rom heavy rains, which can destroy crops and reduce agricultural productivity.
Prolonged rainfall may lead to
water accumulation
in fields, affecting
soil health and damaging crops.
What Measures are Needed for Effective Cyclone Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation?
Before Cyclone:
Land Use Planning:
Implement
land use and
building codes
to restrict habitation in
vulnerable zones
, reserving them for
parks or flood diversion.
Cyclone Early Warning System:
Utilise the new
Impact-Based
Cyclone Warning System
to communicate risks and preparedness actions, focusing on local populations and land use patterns.
Engineered Structures:
Build structures designed to withstand
cyclone winds
, including public infrastructures like hospitals and communication towers.
Mangrove Plantation:
Promote
mangrove
planting
initiatives to shield coastal areas from storm surges and erosion, engaging community participation in these projects.
During Cyclone:
Cyclone Shelters:
Establish cyclone shelters in
high-risk areas
and ensure that shelters are connected to
major roads
quick evacuation and access
during emergencies.
Flood Management:
sea walls, embankments, and drainage systems
to control water flow and reduce flooding from storm surges and heavy rainfall.
After Cyclone:
Hazard Mapping:
Create maps that indicate the
frequency and intensity of cyclones
based on historical data, including storm surges and flooding risks.
Retrofitting Non-Engineered Structures:
Educate communities on retrofitting techniques, such as
building steep-slope roofs
anchoring poles
, to enhance the resilience of non-engineered homes.
Conclusion
underscores the importance of
proactive disaster management
measures, including effective
early warning systems, land use planning, and community involvement.
By enhancing
infrastructure resilience, implementing hazard mapping, and promoting mangrove conservation
, we can better prepare for and mitigate the impacts of cyclones on vulnerable coastal regions.

Poleward Shift of Atmospheric Rivers
Source: DTE
Why in News?
A recent study reported that atmospheric rivers have shifted 6 to 10 degrees poleward over the past 40 years, influencing global weather patterns.
This shift is increasing
droughts
in some regions while intensifying
floods
in others, with major implications for water resources and climate stability.
<img caption="false" class="content-img" src="http://drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1730098356_Atmospheric_River.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650"/>
Why are Atmospheric Rivers Shifting Polewards?
Sea Surface Temperature Changes:
Atmospheric rivers are shifting poleward due to
cooling of sea surface temperatures
in the
eastern tropical Pacific
since 2000, associated with
La Niña
conditions.
As a result,
subtropics may experience more prolonged droughts
nd water scarcity,
higher latitudes could see more extreme rainfall and flooding
Walker Circulation
: During
Walker circulation
strengthens over the
western Pacific
, expanding the tropical rainfall belt. This change, combined with alterations in atmospheric eddy patterns, creates high-pressure anomalies that steer ARs toward the poles.
The
is a cyclic pattern of air movement around the
equator
that plays a crucial role in
climate and weather.
Long-term Climate Trends:
IPCC
reports that global temperatures have increased by approximately 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era. Warmer conditions have altered jet stream patterns, shifting them poleward. This movement pushes ARs toward higher latitudes, impacting weather patterns and raising the frequency of extreme events in those areas.
What are Implications of the Poleward Shift of Atmospheric Rivers?
Water Resource Management
: Subtropics regions like California and southern Brazil, which rely on ARs for vital rainfall, may face
longer droughts and water shortages
as ARs become
less frequent
. This could lead to increased stress on agriculture and local communities.
Increased Flooding and Landslides
: Higher Latitudes areas like the US Pacific Northwest, Europe, and even polar regions could see more
extreme rainfall, flooding, and landslides
due to the poleward movement of ARs threatening infrastructure and safety.
Arctic Climate Impact:
The movement of ARs into the Arctic could
accelerate sea ice melting
Research found that atmospheric rivers contribute to
36% of the rise in summer moisture
over the Arctic since 1979.
Predictive Challenges:
The variability of natural processes, such as the oscillation between
El Niño
La Niña,
complicates predictions about future atmospheric river behaviour.
Current
climate models
may underestimate these natural variabilities, leading to potential miscalculations in forecasting weather patterns and water availability.
What are Atmospheric Rivers?
About:
Atmospheric rivers (ARs)
long, narrow bands of moisture in the atmosphere
transport vast amounts of water vapour from tropical regions to mid-latitude areas
other areas
, particularly outside of the tropics.
E.g., The
“Pineapple Express”
is an atmospheric river transporting warm, humid air from the tropical Pacific near Hawaii to North America’s west coast, particularly California.
Conditions Required for Formation of AR:
Strong Low-Level Winds:
These winds serve as pathways for transporting water vapour, with
jet streams
Northern and Southern hemispheres
acting as
high-speed channels,
sometimes reaching up to 442 km/h (275 mph).
High Moisture Levels
: Adequate moisture is critical to initiate precipitation processes.
Orographic Lift:
When moist
air masses
ascend over elevated terrain, such as mountains, they cool as they rise. This cooling process increases humidity, leading to cloud formation and, under suitable conditions, precipitation.
Categories:
Category 1 (Weak):
A mild, short-duration event, with beneficial effects like
light rainfall
over 24 hours.
Category 2 (Moderate):
A Category 2 atmospheric river is a
moderate storm
with mostly beneficial effects, but also somewhat hazardous.
Category 3 (Strong):
stronger and more prolonged event
, bringing 5-10 inches of rain over 36 hours. It can help replenish reservoirs but may also raise some rivers near flood stage.
Category 4 (Extreme):
Primarily hazardous, though with limited benefits. It can bring
intense rainfall
over several days, likely pushing many rivers to flood levels.
Category 5 (Exceptional):
Largely hazardous
e.g., an atmospheric river over Central California during the 1996-97 caused damages exceeding USD 100 billion.
Key Characteristics:
Length:
Often referred to as
"rivers in the sky,"
atmospheric rivers can extend for thousands of kilometres and vary in size and strength, similar to terrestrial rivers.
Seasonal Occurrence
: In the Northern Hemisphere, they typically occur between December and February, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they are most common from June to August.
In August 2022,
New Zealand
experienced an atmospheric river that caused record
rainfall, flooding, and displacement
was struck by
12 atmospheric rivers
between December 2022 and March 2023, resulting in intense
rainfall, flooding, and wind damage.
Water Vapour Capacity:
An average atmospheric river transports water vapour equivalent to the flow at the mouth of the
Mississippi River
, with exceptionally strong ones capable of carrying up to 15 times that volume.
Variability:
No two atmospheric rivers are alike; their characteristics differ based on factors like atmospheric instability and
Atmospheric rivers can produce both beneficial rainfall and destructive flooding, highlighting their dual role in influencing weather patterns.
Atmospheric River on Reaching Land:
When an
atmospheric river reaches land
moisture-laden air rises and cools
over mountain ranges, resulting in
heavy precipitation as rain or snow.
Unlike cold winter storms, atmospheric rivers are warm, leading to rapid snowpack melting, runoff, and flooding, impacting regions’ water supply.
The Role of Climate Change:
Climate change
is causing average temperatures on Earth to rise, leading to more water vapour in the
and increasing the likelihood of damaging atmospheric rivers.
Studies indicate that atmospheric rivers in the Southern Hemisphere have been
shifting poleward by up to 0.72° per decade
due to anthropogenic factors.
These shifts influence
ocean temperatures, atmospheric CO2 levels,
and the
ozone layer
As the planet warms, the
intensity and frequency
of atmospheric rivers are
expected to increase
more extreme rainfall events
by up to 40% in some areas.

What are the Role of Atmospheric Rivers?
Positive Role:
Redistribution of Freshwater:
AR are responsible for more than 50% of the mean annual runoff in many regions. For example, California relies on ARs for up to 50% of its annual rainfall, making them vital for water supply and agriculture.
Global Water Cycle:
AR plays a vital role in the
global water cycle
, influencing both water supply and flood risks, especially in the western United States. They are essential for replenishing snowpacks and can significantly impact weather patterns.
Snowpack Formation:
During colder months, atmospheric rivers deposit snow, which later melts to maintain water levels in warmer months. Snowpacks also reflect sunlight, helping cool Earth's surface.
Negative Role:
Flooding:
Excessive precipitation can lead to soil saturation, which in turn causes
, particularly in areas without sufficient vegetation.
Landslides and Mudslides:
Steep terrain, deforested areas, and large amounts of rain increase the risk of
and mudslides
Droughts:
A lack of atmospheric rivers can contribute to prolonged droughts, leading to water scarcity,
food insecurity,
and heightened human conflicts.

Conclusion
poleward shift of atmospheric rivers
, driven by climate change, is causing significant disruptions in global weather patterns.
Higher latitudes
increased precipitation and flooding
lower latitudes
may face severe

weather forecasting
, invest in
