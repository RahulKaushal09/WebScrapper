TRAI tightens rules against spam calls and text messages
Why in news?
India’s telecom regulator,
, has introduced new rules under the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, to curb spam calls and messages.
Telecom operators like Airtel, Jio, and Vi must analyze call and SMS patterns in real time to detect spammers and report spam activity. Misreporting can result in fines ranging from ₹2 lakh for the first offense to ₹10 lakh for repeated violations.
The revised regulations aim to combat evolving telecom misuse and create a more transparent commercial communication system for consumers.

Cracking Down on Spam Communication
Rising Spam Calls: A Daily Nuisance
Faster Action Against Spam
Users can now report spam more easily, with telecom operators required to act within
5 days
, down from the previous
30-day limit
Clear Identification of Spam Calls
Telemarketers can no longer use
normal 10-digit numbers
for promotional calls. Instead:
140 series
remains for promotional calls.
1600 series
is now designated for
transactional and service calls
(already being implemented).
Opting Out of Promotional Messages
Telecom operators must provide a mechanism for users to
opt out
of promotional communication, though users can
opt in
Stricter Monitoring of Spam Activity
Operators must
based on factors like:
High call volumes
Short call durations
Low incoming-to-outgoing call ratios
This real-time monitoring helps detect potential spammers.
Stronger Verification & Penalties
Telemarketers must undergo physical verification, biometric authentication, and unique mobile number linking.
Repeated violators will have all telecom resources suspended.
Operators must maintain detailed records of complaints and sender information to ensure quick action.
Millions of Indians face persistent spam calls from sectors like banking and insurance, despite repeated government efforts to curb the issue.
A LocalCircles survey (Feb 2023) of 12,000 respondents revealed:
60% receive 3 or more spam calls daily
30% get 1-2 spam calls per day
36% receive 3-5 calls daily
21% get 6-10 calls daily
3% receive over 10 unwanted calls daily
The issue continues to worsen, with telecom operators often playing a role in the surge.

**********Trump Engages Putin in Talks for Negotiated Ukraine War Settlement
Why in news?
President Trump, in his second term, held a "lengthy and highly productive" call with Russian President Putin, marking their first confirmed conversation since Trump resumed office. The discussion signaled the start of a US-backed effort to negotiate an end to the
Ukraine war
What’s in today’s article?
Trump Steps into Mediator Role for Ukraine War
Europe Demands Role in Ukraine Peace Talks
Significance of Trump-Putin Call
Trump Steps Into Mediator Role for Ukraine War
President Trump has prioritized mediating an end to the Ukraine war, a goal he has pursued since the start of his second term.
The US team aims to facilitate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine to stabilize the region.
Russia’s Response and Diplomatic Engagement
The Kremlin confirmed the 90-minute conversation.
Putin acknowledged Trump’s peace efforts and agreed that the time had come for both nations to collaborate on global stability.
Shift in Trump’s Stance on Russia
Trump’s approach to Russia has evolved from his first term, when he faced criticism for being too lenient toward Putin.
While he previously praised Putin’s strategic moves, he has since adopted a more critical stance, questioning Russia’s handling of the war.
Challenges Ahead for Peace Talks
Despite Trump’s diplomatic push, significant obstacles remain.
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has been reluctant to negotiate on terms that could compromise Ukrainian sovereignty, especially given strong Western military and financial support.
Additionally, there is skepticism about Russia’s intentions, with concerns that the Kremlin may use negotiations to stall while solidifying territorial gains in eastern Ukraine.
European officials have asserted that Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations, responding to Trump’s announcement of US-Russia peace talks.
Trump’s Stance on NATO and Ukraine’s Borders
Trump has signaled a shift in US policy, suggesting that Ukraine should abandon its NATO bid and that restoring its pre-2014 borders was unrealistic.
As per various experts, the US is deprioritizing European security, emphasizing border control and deterring China instead.
A Potential Shift in Global Relations
Trump is reshaping great power dynamics, with his latest call to Putin marking a significant departure from past US policy.
Trump invoked World War II, comparing his discussions with Putin to the historic Yalta Summit.
He emphasized shared history and cooperation, effectively ending over a decade of Russia’s isolation by the West.
Trump announced immediate ceasefire talks for Ukraine and plans to meet Putin in Saudi Arabia soon, signaling a potential turning point in international relations.
Europe’s Exclusion from Trump-Putin Talks
Like in 1945, Europe is absent from the negotiating table as Trump reshapes Ukraine policy.
The US rejects Ukraine’s NATO membership and considers reclaiming lost territories unrealistic.
While past US-Russia talks, including Biden’s 2021 Geneva meeting, failed due to Putin’s demands, Moscow’s weaker position after three years of war might make it more open to negotiations.
If successful, Trump could visit Moscow for Russia’s Victory Day in May, symbolizing a US-Russia agreement.
For Putin, this represents recognition of Russia’s great power status and a shift in Europe’s security order in Moscow’s favor.
Implications for Asia and India
The impact of a potential Trump-Putin deal on Asia remains unclear. Key questions arise:
Will Trump shift focus to counter China?
Could he extend his peace efforts to Taiwan?
How will this affect Moscow-Beijing ties?
For India
, this is a crucial moment. Unlike in the mid-20th century, India now holds significant influence in global affairs.
Modi’s meeting with Trump will be an opportunity to assess his broader strategy.
Beyond geopolitics, their discussions will likely cover economic restructuring, particularly countering China’s trade dominance.
With both nations facing trade deficits with China, PM Modi may align with Trump’s call for a
new economic order led by democratic nations to ensure balanced trade

**********New Income-Tax Bill 2025: Simplified Structure and the New ‘Tax Year’ Concept
Why in the News?
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has tabled the new Income Tax Bill in the Lok Sabha.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Income-Tax Bill (Key Features, Impact on Tax Payers, Challenges, etc.)
Introduction:
The government has introduced a new
Income-Tax Bill, 2025
, aimed at simplifying tax laws, making compliance easier, and ensuring a streamlined tax regime.
announced this while presenting the
Union Budget on February 1, 2025
. The bill eliminates outdated provisions, uses clearer language, and introduces the
‘tax year’ concept
, replacing the term
‘assessment year’
While the
overall tax structure remains unchanged
, experts believe the new bill is a step towards a more efficient tax framework, ensuring that taxpayers can easily navigate provisions without excessive cross-referencing.
If passed, the
new Income-Tax Bill is expected to come into effect from April 1, 2026
Key Features of the New Income-Tax Bill:
Introduction of the ‘Tax Year’ Concept
The bill defines
as a
12-month period beginning from April 1
Unlike the existing system where income earned in one financial year is assessed in the following assessment year,
tax will now be calculated within the same tax year
If a business or profession is set up mid-year, the tax year will begin from the date of establishment and end on March 31.
Simplified and Crisp Language
The bill reduces
provisos, cross-referencing, and complex explanations
, making tax laws easier to understand.
length of the Income-Tax Act has been reduced from 823 pages to 622 pages
, despite keeping the
number of chapters unchanged at 23
The number of
clauses has increased from 298 to 536
, incorporating provisions that were earlier scattered across multiple sections.
Expansion of the Definition of ‘Income’
The new bill
includes virtual digital assets (VDAs)
, such as
cryptocurrencies and NFTs, as part of taxable capital assets
This aligns VDAs with existing asset categories like
land, buildings, shares, bullion, and artwork
Removal of Redundant Provisions
removes outdated exemptions
Section 54E
, which provided capital gains exemptions for transfers before April 1992.
Unnecessary amendments and references to
old dates and laws have been eliminated
Improved Clarity in Tax Provisions
Several provisions, including
tax deducted at source (TDS) rules, presumptive taxation rates, and assessment time limits
, have been consolidated into easy-to-read tables.
Deductions for salaries
(standard deduction, gratuity, and leave encashment) are now compiled in one section, improving clarity.
Reform in the Dispute Resolution Process
Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP)
now clearly defines:
Points of determination
Decisions
Reasons for rulings
Impact on Taxpayers and Businesses:
Easier Compliance for Taxpayers
The removal of multiple cross-references between
sections and rules
ensures that
a taxpayer can understand a provision without needing to refer to multiple documents
The language of tax laws has been simplified, with terms like "notwithstanding" replaced by "irrespective of anything
Streamlined Tax Filing and Compliance
The bill consolidates provisions related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventory, and income exclusions in schedules, rather than scattering them across different sections.
Provisions from other tax laws, such as wealth tax, have been incorporated, reducing the need for external references.
Digital and Service-Oriented Economy Considerations
The bill introduces
new sections covering revenue recognition for service contracts
, reflecting the changing structure of the Indian economy.
Digital assets and online income sources are
now clearly classified under capital assets
, ensuring fair taxation.
Challenges and Future Implications:
No Major Structural Reforms
Despite simplifying provisions, the
new bill does not bring major changes in tax rates, penalties, or compliance mechanisms
Experts believe further reforms may be required for a
more taxpayer-friendly system
Transition Challenges
Taxpayers and businesses may require time to
adapt to the ‘tax year’ concept
Accountants and financial professionals will need to
update their systems and tax planning strategies
Pending Legislative Approval
The bill is
scheduled for introduction in Lok Sabha this week
and will be reviewed by a
parliamentary committee
before final approval.
Conclusion:
aims to make taxation
simpler, clearer, and more streamlined
. The introduction of the
, removal of redundant provisions, and improved clarity in tax laws are positive steps towards an
efficient tax system
However, while the bill improves
language and structure
, it does
not introduce significant policy changes
in tax rates, penalties, or compliance mechanisms.
The government’s focus remains on
continuity and simplification
, setting the stage for further tax reforms in the future.

**********Tackling Heatwaves - Strengthening Resilience in India
Context:
Disasters are often perceived as distant threats, but climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events.
Among them,
heatwaves have become a silent killer in India
, impacting public health, infrastructure, and economic stability. However,
public awareness
regarding heatwave risks remains
alarmingly low
Rising Heatwave Threat in India:
India is experiencing
more frequent, prolonged, and severe
January 2025
marked the 18th month in the last 19 where global temperatures crossed the 1.5°C threshold.
The Paris Summit goal
of limiting global temperature rise to 2°C is now
nearly unattainable
Impacts of Heatwaves:
Public health crisis:
90% of Indians are vulnerable to heat-related illnesses. Rural healthcare systems are overburdened due to heat-induced ailments.
Economic consequences:
Heat stress
could cause 34 million job losses
in India by 2030 (World Bank). Outdoor workers suffer
productivity losses
Water scarcity and food security:
The supply of water is not keeping up with the rising demand.
Only 4% of the world's freshwater is found in India
, while having 18% of the world's population.
54%
of India’s land faces
high-to-extreme-high water stress
(WRI).
Declining groundwater levels
and rising irrigation demands threaten agriculture.
Heatwaves can lead to
crop failures and reduced yields
Energy sector challenges:
Increased power demand for cooling
strains the energy supply.
70% of India’s power is generated by thermal plants
that rely on water for cooling, making them vulnerable to inefficiencies.
Government Response and Policy Interventions:

**********China’s Dam Project Opens the Floodgates of Concern
Context
China’s plan to construct a massive hydroelectric dam on the lower section of the upper stream of the Yarlung Zangbo River
in Tibet (called Brahmaputra in India) has
sparked significant concerns, particularly in India.
The Brahmaputra River
plays a crucial role in the lives of millions in India’s northeastern states and Bangladesh.
While China’s transition to renewable energy through hydroelectric projects aligns with its environmental and economic objectives,
the potential consequences for downstream countries highlight serious environmental, geopolitical, and legal challenges.
Legal Dimensions and International Water Laws
The construction of the dam
brings into focus critical legal issues under international water law.
UN Watercourses Convention (1997) emphasises equitable and reasonable utilisation of water resources,
the obligation to prevent significant harm, and the duty to cooperate among riparian states.
However,
neither China nor India is a signatory to this convention,
which complicates the resolution of disputes over transboundary rivers.
China’s official stance
on water management includes principles such as
international cooperation, shared rights and obligation
s, and equal emphasis on development and protection.
lower riparian states often accuse China of using water as a strategic tool.
India, which relies on Tibetan-origin rivers for one-third of its water supply, sees China’s unilateral actions as a serious threat.
The MoUs between India and China
on sharing water data for the Sutlej and Brahmaputra rivers have
lapsed
, but recent diplomatic engagements provide hope for their renewal.
In the absence of a formal agreement
, the Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) serves as a vital platform
for managing water-related matters.
Environmental Risks and Ecological Impact
Seismic Risks and Structural Vulnerability
One of the most significant environmental concerns is the
high seismic activity of the Tibetan Plateau
, where the dam is being built.
The Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau are part of the
Indo-Eurasian tectonic plate collision zone
, making them one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.
The potential for earthquakes, landslides, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in the region poses a serious
threat to the dam’s structural integrity and downstream communities
If an earthquake were to damage or destroy the dam,
a sudden release of water could cause catastrophic floods in downstream regions,
particularly in India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam.
These areas are already prone to annual flooding, and
an artificial flood triggered by dam failure could lead to massive loss of life and property.
Disruption of River Ecosystems
Brahmaputra River system supports a delicate ecological balance
, which is essential for both aquatic and terrestrial species.
The construction of a massive dam disrupts the
natural flow of the river
, leading to major ecological changes.
The dam will likely trap large amounts of
sediments
, which are essential for maintaining fertile floodplains downstream.
This could lead to
reduced soil fertility in Assam and Bangladesh
, impacting agriculture and food security and
increased erosion in downstream areas
, as the river will carry less sediment to reinforce riverbanks.
Dams alter the
temperature and oxygen content
of river water, which affects fish populations and other aquatic life.
Species adapted to free-flowing rivers may struggle to survive in the
artificially controlled water conditions
created by the dam.
Threats to Biodiversity and Wildlife
The Yarlung Zangbo and Brahmaputra river basins are home to diverse species, including
endangered aquatic animals like the Gangetic river dolphin and various migratory birds
. The construction of the dam could lead to
habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity
Many fish species rely on free-flowing rivers to migrate and reproduce. The dam will likely
block migration routes
, leading to population decline and even extinction of some species.
The surrounding forested and wetland areas will also be affected, reducing breeding and feeding grounds for species like the
Bengal tiger
one-horned rhinoceros
in India’s Kaziranga National Park.
It will also endanger
rare bird species
such as the black-necked crane, which breeds in Tibet and relies on riverine ecosystems.
Geopolitical Challenges and the Need for Regional Cooperation
The water dispute between China and India cannot be viewed in isolation from broader geopolitical tensions.
Water-related activities in Tibet affect not just India and Bangladesh but also
Nepal, Bhutan, and Pakistan
, all of which are lower riparian states.
regional water negotiation plan
could help South Asian nations develop a unified response, but political divisions make such an alliance difficult to achieve.
The lack of a strong regional organization
to manage transboundary water resources further weakens South Asia’s ability to negotiate with China.
Bilateral tensions
between India and its neighbours fluctuate frequently, making coordinated water diplomacy a challenge.
Additionally, the broader political relationship between India and China influences water-related decisions, with
trust deficits often impeding constructive engagement.
The Way Forward
To mitigate risks and build trust,
renewed diplomatic engagements
and enhanced information-sharing through mechanisms like the Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) are crucial.
A more structured regional approach
to water governance could also help South Asian nations collectively address their shared concerns.
achieving this will require overcoming political divisions and creating stronger bilateral and multilateral cooperation.
Conclusion
China’s proposed hydroelectric dam on the Yarlung Zangbo presents
a complex challenge
for India and other lower riparian states.
While China maintains that the dam will not significantly impact downstream water flow, India remains concerned about its
environmental, legal, and geopolitical implications
absence of binding international agreements on transboundary rivers further complicates the situation.

**********The Problematic Globalisation of Medical Education
Context
Medical education is undergoing significant transformations worldwide
. While there is a growing shortage of doctors, barriers to accessing medical education persist.
As a result,
an increasing number of students are seeking medical training abroad
, leading to an internationalisation of medical education.
However,
this trend raises concerns about the quality and regulation of foreign medical programs.
Therefore,
now it is imperative to explore the global mobility of medical students, the specific challenges faced by Indian students, and the broader implications
for medical education worldwide.
The Paradox of Medical Education
On the one hand, many countries face an acute shortage of doctors,
yet access to medical education remains restricted.
Governments and professional bodies often limit the number of medical seats available
, making it difficult for aspiring doctors to secure training in their home countries.
Consequently,
many students seek medical education abroad
, contributing to a significant international movement of medical students.
Despite this mobility, concerns persist regarding the quality of medical training
in some host countries.
Institutions in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and the Caribbean have become popular destinations
, yet their educational standards vary widely.
This
raises critical questions about the effectiveness of national regulations and the preparedness of graduates returning to practice
A Detailed Analysis of India’s Medical Education Crisis
The Shortage of Medical Seats and Intense Competition
India has a
severe shortage of doctors
, with the
doctor-to-patient ratio falling short of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) recommended ratio of 1:1000.
While the demand for medical professionals is high,
the availability of seats in medical colleges remains limited.
Each year, around 2.3 million students appear for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET),
the nationwide entrance exam for medical colleges.
with just 700+ medical colleges offering seats, only a small fraction of students, roughly one in 22
, succeed in securing admission. This intense competition stems from multiple factors:
Limited Government Medical Seats
Public medical colleges in
India offer a relatively small number of seats compared to the vast number of applicants.
Government-run institutions are highly sought after due to their lower tuition fees
and better infrastructure, making them extremely competitive.
High Fees in Private Institutions
Private medical colleges, which constitute a significant portion of India’s medical education system, charge exorbitant tuition fees,
often ranging between ₹50 lakh to ₹1 crore for an MBBS degree.
makes medical education unaffordable
for many middle-class and lower-income students.
Reservation Policies:
While reservation policies help ensure access for marginalised communities,
they also limit the number of open-category seats, making competition even tougher for general applicants.
Implications: The Rise in Medical Students Studying Abroad
Due to these constraints,
a growing number of Indian students are opting for medical education abroad.
It is estimated that
over 20,000 Indian students travel to countries such as Russia, Ukraine (before the war), Kazakhstan, China, the Philippines
, Nepal, and Mauritius to pursue medical degrees.
Reasons why Indian students choose to study medicine abroad:
Affordability
Many foreign universities offer medical education at a
significantly lower cost compared to Indian private medical colleges.
For example,
medical programs in Russia, Ukraine, and China often cost between ₹20-40 lakh, making them a more viable option.
Lower Admission Barriers:
Unlike India, where NEET ranks dictate admissions,
many foreign universities have relatively relaxed entry requirements,
making it easier for students to secure a seat.
English-Medium Programs:
Many foreign medical schools,
especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, offer MBBS courses in English, making them accessible to Indian students.
Government Initiatives Regarding the Expansion of Indian Medical Education
Increase in Medical Seats
In the 2025 Union Budget,
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that nearly 1.1 lakh medical seats
had been added over the past decade, marking a 130% increase.
Additionally,
the government plans to introduce 10,000 more seats in 2026, with a broader goal of adding 75,000 seats over five years.
Establishment of New Medical Colleges:
The government has focused on
setting up new medical colleges, especially in underserved areas,
through initiatives like Public-Private Partnerships (PPP).
Reforms in Medical Licensing:
The National Medical Commission (NMC) has introduced
new guidelines to regulate foreign medical education and ensure that returning students meet national standards.
Bringing Indian-Operated Institutions Abroad
Some Indian education groups,
such as the Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG), have established medical colleges abroad, such as the Manipal College of Medical Sciences in Nepal
and the American University of Antigua (AUA) in the Caribbean.
These institutions
provide alternative options for Indian students while maintaining some level of quality control.
International Movement of Medical Students: A Widespread Phenomenon
The international movement of medical students is
not limited to the Global South.
Western nations such as France, Germany, and Norway also face medical education shortages
, prompting students to seek training in neighbouring countries.
Central and Eastern Europe, including Romania, Hungary, and Poland, have become key destinations
for students from Western Europe and even the United States.
English-medium medical programs in non-English speaking countries cater to international students
, often at high tuition rates.
many of these institutions operate with minimal regulatory oversight, raising concerns about the quality of education and medical preparedness.
The existence of for-profit medical schools catering exclusively to international students further complicates the situation, highlighting the need for greater scrutiny and quality control.
The Way Ahead: Balancing Demand and Quality
growing demand for medical education abroad presents both opportunities and challenges.
On the one hand, i
nternational mobility allows students to pursue their aspirations and helps address global shortages
of medical professionals.
On the other hand,
the lack of uniform quality standards poses risks to healthcare systems worldwide.
Governments must strike a balance between increasing medical seats domestically and ensuring the quality
of medical graduates.
requires significant investment in medical infrastructure,
faculty, and accreditation processes.
Moreover,
stricter regulations on foreign medical degrees and licensing exams can help ensure that returning graduates meet national standards.
Conclusion
The globalisation of medical education is an evolving phenomenon
with far-reaching implications.
While it offers a solution to limited access in many countries,
it also raises concerns about educational quality, regulatory oversight, and healthcare workforce stability.
Countries like India have recognised the problem and are taking steps to expand medical education,
but more needs to be done.
A coordinated global approach, involving stricter regulations and increased investment in medical training, is necessary
to ensure that medical education remains both accessible and of high quality.

**********[14th February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: The problematic globalisation of medical education
Governance
PYQ Relevance:
) Public health system has limitation in providing universal health coverage. Do you think that private sector can help in bridging the gap? What other viable alternatives do you suggest?
(UPSC CSE 2015)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
the Public health system (2015),
and
Health for All’ in India
(2018).
Medical education is changing in unusual ways. There is a shortage of doctors, yet governments and medical professionals limit access to medical studies. As a result, more students from different countries travel abroad to study medicine. In the past, medical education was international, but now each country controls it while it still becomes more global. This trend is important because of healthcare needs. The exact number of students studying medicine abroad is unknown, but it is estimated to be over 200,000, often in low-quality institutions. Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine had 24,000 foreign medical students, mostly from India.
Today’s editorial talks about issues in the  Medical sector. This content would help in GS Papers 1, 2 and 3 to substantiate your answer.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Studying medicine abroad is common, but it is largely unnoticed and lacks proper regulation.
How does the globalization of medical education impact the quality and accessibility of healthcare?
Increased Access to Medical Education but Quality Concerns Persist:
India has only
1 medical seat for every 22 applicants
, with
2.3 million students
appearing for NEET annually.
over 20,000 Indian students
go abroad for medical studies each year. While foreign education provides an alternative, some countries have
lax regulatory frameworks
, leading to concerns over clinical training standards.
Low Licensing Exam Pass Rates for Foreign Medical Graduates:
India’s
Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) pass rate
has historically been
below 20%
2022, only 10,500 out of 41,349 candidates (25.4%)
cleared the exam. Many foreign-trained doctors struggle to meet national standards, delaying their entry into the healthcare system.
Disproportionate Dependence on Foreign-trained Doctors in Some Countries:
In the US,
25% of physicians
are international medical graduates (IMGs), while in the UK,
37% of doctors
in the NHS come from abroad.
While globalization helps address doctor shortages in developed countries, it exacerbates the “brain drain” in source countries like India, Nigeria, and Pakistan.
Growth of For-profit Medical Schools with Limited Oversight:
Caribbean region alone has over 50 private medical schools
, many catering exclusively to international students from the US and Canada.
These institutions charge high tuition fees but often lack sufficient clinical training infrastructure, raising concerns about graduate competence.
Shortage of Trained Doctors in Source Countries:
The WHO estimates a
global shortfall of 10 million healthcare workers by 2030
Africa facing a deficit of 6 million doctors and nurses
Many doctors trained abroad do not return home, worsening healthcare shortages in low-income countries while benefiting high-income nations.
What are the consequences of medical degrees that are obtained abroad, especially from countries with lower academic standards?
High Failure Rates in Licensing Exams:
Foreign-trained doctors often struggle to meet national medical standards, leading to low pass rates in licensing exams.
Example:
In India, the
cleared the exam, delaying their entry into the healthcare system.
Limited Clinical Exposure and Skill Gaps:
Some foreign medical colleges lack proper clinical training, affecting students’ hands-on experience in diagnosing and treating patients.
Several Caribbean medical schools, catering to US and Canadian students, have faced criticism for their
limited hospital affiliations
, forcing students to complete clinical rotations in different countries.
Difficulty in Securing Residency and Employment:
Graduates from lesser-known foreign institutions often struggle to secure postgraduate training and jobs in competitive healthcare markets.
United States, international medical graduates (IMGs) face higher rejection rates
for medical residencies, with
only about 60% of non-US IMGs matching into residency programs
in 2023, compared to 93% of US medical graduates.
Is the global mobility of medical education sustainable, and how does it affect local health systems?
Brain Drain Weakens Healthcare in Source Countries:
Many doctors trained abroad do not return, leading to a shortage of medical professionals in their home countries.
Nigeria loses over 2,000 doctors annually
to migration, worsening its doctor-to-patient ratio, which stands at
1:5,000
, far below the
WHO-recommended 1:1,000
Unequal Distribution of Healthcare Professionals:
High-income countries attract foreign-trained doctors, leaving rural and underserved regions in low- and middle-income nations critically short-staffed.
India, only 20% of doctors serve in rural areas
, even though
65% of the population
resides there, leading to severe healthcare disparities.
Reliance on Foreign-trained Doctors in Host Countries:
Developed nations depend on foreign medical graduates to fill workforce gaps, making their healthcare systems vulnerable to changing immigration policies.
UK’s NHS workforce includes 37% foreign-trained doctors
, with a significant number from India and Pakistan.
Way forward:
Strengthening Domestic Medical Education Infrastructure:
Increase the number of medical seats and improve the quality of training in home countries to reduce dependence on foreign institutions.
India has added over
100 new medical colleges
since 2019 to expand access to medical education.
Stricter Accreditation and Recognition of Foreign Medical Degrees:
Establish global accreditation standards and bilateral agreements to ensure only high-quality foreign medical degrees are recognized.
National Exit Test (NExT) in India
will standardize assessment for both domestic and foreign medical graduates.

Ethics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Ethics and Morality issues;
Why in the News?
The Maharashtra cyber police have denied YouTuber Samay Raina’s request for more time to join the investigation into a case against him, podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia, and others. The case was filed over an “obscene joke” made by Allahbadia on Raina’s show,
What is an “obscene joke”?
An
is a joke that contains
sexually explicit, vulgar, or offensive
content that may be considered inappropriate, indecent, or immoral by societal standards.
What are the Ethical Issues Surrounding Obscenity?
Freedom of Expression vs. Public Morality:
Content creators often push boundaries in comedy, art, and media, but their work may conflict with societal norms and moral values.
Example:
A stand-up comedian making jokes about religious figures or sexual themes faces backlash from communities who find it offensive.
Cultural Sensitivities and Perception:
What is considered obscene varies across cultures, making content regulation complex.
Nudity in Western films may be viewed as artistic, whereas in India, it often faces censorship under decency laws.
Impact on Vulnerable Audiences:
Children and adolescents may be influenced by explicit content, shaping their attitudes toward relationships, gender roles, and social behaviour.
Music videos with sexually suggestive lyrics and visuals can promote unrealistic or unhealthy perceptions of relationships.
Exploitation and Objectification:
Media and advertisements sometimes use sexually provocative imagery, reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.
Advertisements that use hypersexualized images of women to sell products contribute to the objectification of women.
Accountability of Content Creators and Platforms:
Digital platforms and influencers have a responsibility to regulate content while ensuring free speech is not misused.
A YouTube influencer posting explicit prank videos that go viral raises concerns about platform moderation and ethical responsibility.
What are the legal provisions related to Obscenity?
Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860
Section 292
: Prohibits the sale, distribution, and public exhibition of obscene materials, including books, paintings, and electronic content.
Section 293
: Increases punishment for selling obscene materials to minors.
Section 294
: Penalizes obscene acts and songs in public places.
Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000
Section 67
: Prohibits the publication, transmission, and distribution of obscene electronic content, including on social media and online platforms.
Section 67A
: Imposes stricter penalties for publishing sexually explicit material in electronic form.
Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986:
Restricts the depiction of women in an indecent or derogatory manner in advertisements, publications, and other media.
What can be the Key Recommendations for Obscenity?
Clear Legal Definitions and Guidelines:
Laws should define “obscenity” more precisely to avoid subjective interpretations and misuse.
Updating Section 292 of the IPC to distinguish between artistic expression and truly obscene content.
Stronger Content Moderation on Digital Platforms:
Social media and streaming services should implement stricter policies to regulate obscene content.
YouTube and Instagram enforce AI-based content moderation to flag and remove explicit material.
Public Awareness and Media Literacy:
Educating audiences, especially minors, about responsible content consumption and the impact of obscene materials.
Schools include media literacy programs to help students critically analyze digital content.
Balanced Regulation Without Censorship:
Authorities should ensure that restrictions on obscenity do not infringe on creative freedom and free speech.
Allowing adult-rated films and stand-up comedy with proper disclaimers instead of outright bans.
Stronger Accountability for Content Creators and Influencers:
Creators should adhere to ethical guidelines and be held accountable for promoting obscene or harmful content.
Social media influencers issue public apologies and remove controversial videos after backlash.
Way forward:
Strengthening Regulatory Mechanisms:
Implement a balanced framework that ensures accountability without suppressing creative freedom.
Establishing independent review bodies to assess content complaints objectively.
Promoting Ethical Digital Responsibility:
Encourage responsible content creation and consumption through self-regulation and industry guidelines.
Platforms introducing stricter age-restriction features and user awareness campaigns.

**********A constant legal tussle over the state’s “unique constitutional status”
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Clash between Delhi and Central Government;
Why in the News?
Over the past decade, the Aam Aadmi Party’s government in Delhi has been in a constant legal battle with the Centre over the city’s special constitutional status and how it should be governed.
What is the Constitutional status of Delhi?
Union Territory with Special Status
– Delhi is a Union Territory (UT) but has a
legislative assembly and council of ministers
, unlike most other UTs. It is governed under
Article 239 and Article 239AA
of the Indian Constitution.
Limited Legislative Powers
– The Delhi Legislative Assembly can make laws on subjects in the
State List and Concurrent List
, except for
police, public order, and land
, which remain under the control of the
(Article 239AA(3)(a)).
Three Power Centers
– Governance in Delhi is divided among:
Chief Minister and Council of Ministers
(elected government)
Lieutenant Governor (L-G)
(appointed by the President)
Union Home Ministry
(exercises control over law, order, and services).
L-G’s Role and Discretionary Powers
– While the L-G is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, they can refer matters to the
in case of disagreements, giving the Centre overriding authority (Article 239AA(4)).
Sui Generis (Unique) Model
– The Supreme Court has ruled that Delhi’s governance model is
neither like a full-fledged state nor like a regular Union Territory
, making it a special case within India’s federal structure.
How does Delhi differ from other Union Territories and States?
Feature
Delhi (NCT)
Full-Fledged State
Other Union Territories (UTs)
Yes (since 1991)
No (except J&K, Puducherry)
Elected Government
Control Over Public Order
Control Over Land
Yes, has
special powers
No (Governor acts as ceremonial head)
Yes (UTs are directly administered by L-G/Administrator)
Power Over Services (Bureaucracy)
Limited (Disputed between Delhi Govt. & Centre)
Yes (State Govt. controls)
No (Centre controls)
Special Constitutional Provisions
Yes (Article 239AA)
No (Governed under normal state rules)
No (UTs are governed under Article 239)
What are the legal battles between Delhi and the central Government?
Control Over Bureaucracy (Services Department Dispute):
The Centre transferred control of Delhi’s
bureaucracy (services)
to the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) through a 2015 notification. The
Supreme Court (2023)
ruled in favor of the Delhi government, giving it power over services
except police, land, and public order
. However, the Centre later
amended the GNCTD Act (2023)
to override this decision, restoring L-G’s power over services.
Example:
The Delhi government’s attempt to appoint bureaucrats without L-G’s approval was blocked.
Lieutenant Governor’s Special Powers (Interpretation of Article 239AA):
The Centre argued that the
L-G has overriding authority
over all governance matters, while the Delhi government maintained that L-G must act on the aid and advice of the
. In
2018
, the Supreme Court ruled that the
L-G must follow the advice of the Delhi government
, except in matters explicitly under the Centre’s control.
The L-G blocked multiple decisions of the Delhi Cabinet, including the
‘Doorstep Ration Delivery’ scheme
, citing procedural issues.
Control Over Law and Order (Police and Land Disputes):
Delhi’s elected government
has no control over law and order
(including Delhi Police and land administration), leading to governance challenges. The Supreme Court has
repeatedly upheld Centre’s control
over these subjects as per Article 239AA.
The Delhi government sought control over Delhi Police after riots in
2020
, but the Centre refused, citing
law and order as a central subject
What are the implications due to Governance Crisis and Political Fallout?
Administrative Paralysis and Policy Delays:
Frequent clashes between the Delhi government and the L-G have
stalled decision-making
, leading to delays in key projects and governance paralysis.
Mohalla Clinics
initiative for public healthcare faced repeated delays due to bureaucratic approvals and interference by the L-G’s office.
Reduced Accountability and Bureaucratic Resistance:
With
dual control over administration
, bureaucrats often face
conflicting orders
from the elected government and the Centre, leading to inefficiency.
Delhi Jal Board’s water supply projects
were disrupted as officers refused to follow the Delhi government’s directives, citing L-G’s authority.
Political Tensions and Electoral Ramifications:
The governance crisis has
deepened political rivalries
, with the Delhi government accusing the Centre of undermining democracy, while the Centre claims Delhi needs central oversight due to its national capital status.
The arrest of
CM Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia
in the excise policy case led to political instability and weakened AAP’s governance.
What could happen after the election result in future?
Stronger Central Control and Policy Alignment:
With the
BJP in power in both the Centre and Delhi
, governance could become more streamlined as there would be no friction over administrative control.
The L-G’s role in decision-making would likely diminish in practice, as seen in BJP-ruled Puducherry, where Centre-state coordination improved after a BJP-backed government took over.
Reversal of AAP’s Key Policies:
The BJP might
roll back or modify key AAP policies
, such as free electricity, water subsidies, and education reforms, aligning governance with its national agenda.
Similar to how the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh altered welfare schemes after replacing the Congress government, a BJP-led Delhi might review or discontinue AAP’s flagship initiatives.
Way forward:
Clearer Division of Powers
– Amendments to Article 239AA or a judicial clarification can establish a more balanced framework, ensuring smooth governance without frequent conflicts between the Centre and the Delhi government.
Strengthening Cooperative Federalism
– A structured dialogue mechanism between the Centre, L-G, and the elected government can improve coordination.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the essentials of the 69th Constitutional Amendment Act and anomalies, if any that have led to recent reported conflicts between the elected representatives and the institution of the Lieutenant Governor in the administration of Delhi. Do you think that this will give rise to a new trend in the functioning of the Indian federal politics?
