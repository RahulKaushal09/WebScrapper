ANNUAL GROUNDWATER QUALITY REPORT 2024
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Context:
The Annual Groundwater Quality Report 2024 by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has pointed out concerns regarding ground water in various parts of the country arising from nitrates, arsenic, fluoride and uranium among others.
Background: –
While it is a good sign that India now has a robust, scientific system of assessment to monitor the health of groundwater blocks annually, efforts are lacking in getting States to act on these findings
Key takeaways
The number of districts with excessive nitrate in their groundwater has risen from 359 in 2017 to 440 in 2023. This translates to a little more than half of India’s 779 districts having excessive nitrate, or more than 45 mg/L (milligram per litre).
There are two major concerns with excess nitrate content: first, methemoglobinemia, or a reduced ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. This sometimes causes ‘Blue Baby Syndrome,’ in infants.
The bigger problem is environmental: once nitrates in groundwater rise to the surface and become part of lakes and ponds, algal blooms throttle the health of aquatic ecosystems.
High nitrate levels in groundwater can be a result of excessive irrigation which can push nitrates from fertilizers deep into the soil, the report said.
Poor management of animal waste in livestock farming adds to the problem, as it releases nitrates into the soil. Urbanisation and population growth increase wastewater and sewage, which often contain high nitrate levels, while leaking septic systems and poor sewage disposal worsen contamination.
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have a perennial nitrate problem, primarily from geological factors, with relative levels fairly constant since 2017, the report says.
The report further said fluoride concentrations exceeding the permissible limit are a major concern in Rajasthan, Haryana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.
Elevated arsenic levels (more than 10 parts per billion) were found in several states, particularly in the floodplains of the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers.
Long-term exposure to fluoride and arsenic contaminants can have severe health consequences, including fluorosis (from fluoride) and cancer or skin lesions (from arsenic).
Another major concern is the elevated levels of uranium in several regions. Forty-two per cent of samples with uranium concentrations exceeding 100 ppb (parts per billion) came from Rajasthan, and 30 per cent from Punjab, indicating regional hotspots of uranium contamination, the report said.
Chronic exposure to uranium can lead to kidney damage.
The report said that groundwater samples with uranium concentrations above 30 ppb were clustered in areas identified as over-exploited, critical and semi-critical groundwater stress zones, such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

CASH TRANSFER SCHEMES
Mains – GS 2 & GS 3
Increasing resort to cash transfer schemes by political parties for winning elections is a matter of serious concern.
The success of incumbent parties in Maharashtra and Jharkhand appears to be the result of such cash-transfer schemes directed towards women. There are now more than 10 states that have either implemented or announced such schemes.
The temptation to use cash transfers as the one-size-fits-all solution for political parties is many.
With universal access to financial services, these are easy-to-implement, tangible benefits for voters, directly delivered to beneficiaries.
The success of the scheme is also due to the preference of beneficiaries for such cash transfers as they are fungible and unconditional. Most importantly, they bypass middlemen.
While cash transfers may be politically successful, there is no evidence of whether they actually deliver on the purpose for which they are designed.
A study on 20 cash transfer schemes in Latin America found inconclusive evidence regarding their impact on women’s empowerment. Similarly, cash transfers to farmers show limited evidence of success, with real incomes declining since 2018-19, leading to growing farmer unrest.
While it may be premature to assess impacts in the short run, the core issue lies in the assumption that cash transfers alone can solve complex problems, oversimplifying deeper systemic challenges.
Most reforms require policy interventions, which are unlikely to result in any tangible gain in the short run, and require consensus-building and carefully-designed interventions with active participation and investment from the government machinery. For governments, the effort is not worth the benefits that cash transfers deliver in the short run.
This is not to suggest that all cash transfers are undesirable. Programs like the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) have proven effective as social protection nets, while maternity entitlements and scholarships have contributed to improved human development outcomes. However, these schemes cannot replace state investments in services such as health and education. Instead, they function as complementary incentives, encouraging households/communities to utilize these services.
One consequence of cash transfers has been the excessive fiscal strain on government finances at the cost of essential spending on health, education, nutrition or basic infrastructure.
While new cash transfers have been announced, spending on existing basic social protection such as the NSAP, MGNREGA or the maternity-entitlement scheme remains frozen with decline in real terms.
What is needed is a nuanced understanding of the role of cash transfers in supplementing and expanding the social safety nets rather than a quick-fix solution guaranteed to deliver political dividends.

RIGHT TO PROPERTY
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
The right to property is a human right and a constitutional right and no person can be deprived of his or her property without being paid adequate compensation, the Supreme Court ruled recently while also holding that in exceptional circumstances of inordinate delay in disbursement of compensation, the date of fixing the valuation can be shifted to a more recent one.
Supreme Court in the judgment directed that compensation to people who lost their land for the over 20,000-acre Bengaluru-Mysore Infrastructure Corridor (BMIC) project over two decades ago, must be paid according to the market value prevailing in 2019.
Key takeaways from the judgement
Right to Property ceased to be a Fundamental Right by the Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, however, it continues to be a human right in a welfare State, and a constitutional right under Article 300-A of the Constitution, SC ruled.
Article 300-A of the Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. The State cannot dispossess a citizen of his property except in accordance with the procedure established by law, SC said.
The case details
The petitioners, who purchased residential plots in Karnataka’s Gottigere village between 1995 and 1997, had their lands acquired in 2003 under the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966, for BMIC project.
Despite taking possession of the land, state authorities did not finalise compensation for over two decades, forcing the landowners to repeatedly approach courts.
Referring to the principle of eminent domain, the court observed that the State’s power to acquire land against the owner’s wishes comes with an obligation to ensure prompt and fair compensation.
Recognising this injustice, the Supreme Court invoked its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to shift the valuation date of the land to 2019.

SAVITRIBAI PHULE
Prelims – HISTORY
On Savitribai Phule’s 194th birth anniversary on Friday (January 3), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on X paid tribute to India’s first woman teacher.
A Dalit woman from the Mali community, Savitribai was born on January 3, 1831, in Maharashtra’s Naigaon village. Married off at the age of 10, her husband Jyotirao Phule is said to have educated her. Throughout their life, the couple supported each other and in doing so, broke many social barriers.
At a time when it was considered unacceptable for women to even attain education, the Savitribai and Jyotirao went on to open a school for girls in Bhidewada, Pune, in 1848. This became the country’s first girls’ school.
The couple opened more such schools for girls, Shudras and Ati-Shudras in Pune, leading to discontent among  nationalists like Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
Couple started the Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha (‘Home for the Prevention of Infanticide’) for pregnant widows facing discrimination. This was inspired by a turn of events wherein a Brahmin widow was sentenced to life imprisonment. The man who had raped the widow refused to take up any responsibility for the child, driving the widow to infanticide.
Savitribai Phule also advocated inter-caste marriages, widow remarriage, and eradication of child marriage, sati and dowry systems, among other social issues.
In 1873, the Phules set up the Satyashodhak Samaj, a platform open to all, irrespective of their caste, religion or class hierarchies, with the sole aim of bringing social equity. As an extension, they started ‘Satyashodhak Marriage’ – a rejection of Brahmanical rituals where the marrying couple takes a pledge to promote education and equality.
At her husband’s funeral procession on November 28, 1890, Savitribai again defied convention and carried the titve (earthen pot). Walking ahead of the procession, Savitribai was the one who consigned his body to the flames.
Savitribai Phule published her first collection of poems, called Kavya Phule (‘Poetry’s Blossoms’), at the age of 23 in 1854. She published Bavan Kashi Subodh Ratnakar (‘The Ocean of Pure Gems’), in 1892.
Setting an extraordinary example of living a life of compassion, service and courage, Savitribai became involved in relief work during the 1896 famine in Maharashtra and the 1897 Bubonic plague. She herself contracted the disease while taking a sick child to the hospital, and breathed her last on March 10, 1897.

NORTH SEA
Prelims – GEOGRAPHY
U.S. President-elect Donald Trump called to “open up” the North Sea and get rid of windmills in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.
Oil companies have been steadily exiting the North Sea in recent decades with production declining from a peak of 4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) at the start of the millennium to around 1.3 million boe/d today.
The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean, bordered by several European countries: the UK, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.
Location: Lies between Great Britain to the west and mainland Europe to the east, connecting to the Atlantic Ocean via the English Channel and to the Baltic Sea via the Skagerrak Strait.

Economic Importance
Fishing: The North Sea has been a vital fishing ground for centuries, providing a significant source of seafood for many countries.
Oil and Gas: The discovery of oil and natural gas in the North Sea in the 1960s revolutionized the energy industry. The region remains one of the world’s major offshore oil and gas production areas.
Shipping and Trade: The North Sea is a crucial route for maritime trade, connecting major European ports such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, and London.
Renewable Energy: Offshore wind farms are increasingly being developed in the North Sea, contributing to the region’s renewable energy goals.
Whats happening in North Sea?
Trump’s post was in response to a report about U.S. oil and gas producer APA Corp’s unit Apache’s plans to exit North Sea by year-end 2029. The company expects North Sea production to fall by 20% year over year in 2025.
Last year, the British government said it would increase a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to 38% from 35%. The government wants to use the revenue from oil and gas to raise funds for renewable energy projects.
North Sea producers have warned that the higher tax rate could lead to a sharp drop in investments and are exiting from the ageing basin ahead of the new tax increases.

**********Human Metapneumovirus
China is undergoing an upsurge in respiratory diseases, with human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is emerging as a key concern.
About Human Metapneumovirus:
It is a
respiratory virus
that causes mild infections similar to that caused by a common cold.
It was first identified by scientists in 2001 which belongs to the
Pneumoviridae family
, of which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles and mumps are also members.
It can cause
both upper and lower respiratory tract infections
and is generally seen in winter and early spring.
Children, the elderly
and those with
weakened immune systems are more susceptible
to the infection and to developing complications from it.
Signs and symptoms:
Symptoms can resemble those caused by a common cold. They include a
cough, runny or blocked nose, sore, throat
, fever and wheezing.
The estimated incubation period is three to six days.
In most people, the illness goes away on its own within a few days, with rest and supportive care at home.
In a few people however, complications such as
bronchitis or pneumonia
may arise, requiring medical care.
Transmission:
It spreads through
contact with an infected person
or touching objects that have the virus on them.
This can be through: secretions from coughs, sneezes; close contact with someone who has the infection such as shaking hands, hugging; touching a doorknob or a phone or a keyboard that may be contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes.
Treatment:
There
is no vaccine
and there is
no specific antiviral to treat HMPV
. Most people require over-the-counter medications to relieve fever and pain, possibly with a decongestant. Antibiotics will not work for HMPV.

**********What is Blue Baby Syndrome?
High nitrate levels have been found in the groundwater of 440 districts across India, which can cause health issues like blue baby syndrome in infants and are unsafe for drinking.
About Blue Baby Syndrome:
Blue baby syndrome, also called
cyanosis
, is
a condition in babies
in which their
skin appears blue or purple tinged.
What causes blue baby syndrome?
The baby takes on a bluish hue
because of poorly oxygenated blood.
Normally, blood is pumped from the heart to the lungs, where it receives oxygen.
The blood is circulated back through the heart and then throughout the body.
When there’s a problem with the heart, lungs, or blood, blood may not be oxygenated properly.
This causes the skin to take on a blue color.
The lack of oxygenation can
occur for several reasons.
It can occur due to
several congenital (meaning present at birth) heart defects or environmental or genetic factors.
Acquired methemoglobinemia
is more common
than the congenital form. It can be caused
by exposure to a variety of substances
and by some health conditions.
most common cause
of blue baby syndrome is
water contaminated with nitrates.
Symptoms
The most common symptom of blue baby syndrome is a
blue discoloration
of the
skin around the mouth, hands, and feet.
Other potential symptoms of blue baby syndrome include:
difficulty breathing
vomiting
diarrhea
lethargy
increased salivation
loss of consciousness
seizures
In severe cases
, blue baby syndrome can
even cause death.
Treatment
Treatment will
vary depending on what is causing
the baby to turn blue.
If congenital heart disease is causing
the discoloration,
surgery may be required
to correct the abnormalities.
Children with a more severe form
of the condition may
need a medication called methylene blue
, which a doctor will give as an injection.

**********India, Cross-Border Insolvency and Legal Reform
Context
The
growth of international trade has underscored the importance of effective regulation
to address the complex
challenges of cross-border insolvency.
A
predictable insolvency framework is essential for developing economic stability
, attracting foreign investments, and enabling corporate restructuring.
However,
India’s historical and current approaches to insolvency law have struggled to address cross-border complexities
Historical Evolution of Insolvency Laws in India
Colonial Era
The Indian Insolvency Act of 1848 was the country’s first insolvency law,
followed by the Presidency-Towns Insolvency Act, 1909, and the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920.
While these laws provided a structure for managing domestic insolvencies,
they were ill-equipped to handle cross-border cases,
leaving a critical gap in the legal system.
Post-Independence
Post-independence,
these laws remained largely unchanged despite recommendations from the Third Law Commission
in 1964 for modernisation.
It was only in the 1990s
, driven by economic liberalization and globalisation,
that the need for a comprehensive insolvency law,
including provisions for cross-border cases,
gained national attention.
Committees like the Eradi Committee (2000), Mitra Committee (2001), and Irani Committee (2005) advocated
for the adoption of the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, 1997.
Introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC),
introduced in 2016,
marked a significant step forward, focusing on domestic insolvency.
However, despite the inclusion of Sections 234 and 235 to address cross-border insolvency,
these provisions remain dormant due to the lack of reciprocal agreements and government notification,
rendering them legally unenforceable.
Challenges in India's Existing Cross-Border Insolvency Framework
Dormant Provisions in the IBC
Sections 234 and 235 of the IBC
, introduced to manage cross-border insolvency cases,
have been rendered ineffective due to their dormant status.
Section 234 allows the Indian government to enter into reciprocal agreements
with foreign countries to enforce insolvency resolutions,
while Section 235 outlines the procedure for seeking cooperation from foreign courts
through letters of request.
However, these provisions are yet to be operationalised because of two primary issues:
India has not established reciprocal arrangements
with any foreign jurisdiction. These agreements are vital for enabling mutual recognition and enforcement of insolvency proceedings.
Without such agreements, the implementation of Section 234 remains impractical.
Sections 234 and 235 have not been notified by the government
, rendering them legally unenforceable.
This
inaction has left a critical gap in India's insolvency framework
, forcing courts and stakeholders to rely on ad hoc solutions.
Judicial Challenges
Limited Powers of the NCLT
National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is the primary adjudicating authority for insolvency matters
under the IBC.
it lacks the power to recognise or enforce foreign insolvency judgments
. This limitation hampers its ability to address cross-border insolvency comprehensively.
Additionally,
Rule 11 of the NCLAT Rules, 2016, which could allow the NCLT to exercise inherent jurisdiction and facilitate comity with foreign courts
has not been implemented
for IBC matters.
Dependence on Ad Hoc Protocols
In the absence of a formal framework,
Indian courts have resorted to ad hoc cross-border insolvency protocols.
While these have been helpful in individual cases,
such as Jet Airways (India) Limited vs. State Bank of India (2019), they are temporary solutions.
These protocols increase the judicial burden
, elevate transaction costs, and delay resolutions, often reducing the value of a debtor’s assets.
Outdated Communication Mechanisms
Communication between Indian and foreign courts
in insolvency matters is
inefficient and outdated.
Traditional methods of issuing letters of request lack the transparency and speed required for
resolving complex cross-border cases.
This creates additional delays,
increasing uncertainty for stakeholders.
Regulatory and Legislative Shortcomings
Unclear Framework for Recognition of Foreign Proceedings
Unlike countries that have adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency,
India does not have a clear mechanism for recognising foreign insolvency proceedings
results in inconsistent judicial decisions
, as courts often rely on discretionary powers or general principles of comity.
Inadequate Coordination with Foreign Jurisdictions
Cross-border insolvency cases often require seamless coordination
between domestic and foreign jurisdictions.
However, I
ndia's lack of a structured framework for judicial cooperation undermines the efficiency and fairness
Case Study: State Bank of India vs. Jet Airways (India) Limited (2019)
The Jet Airways case is a landmark example of the challenges posed by India’s inadequate cross-border insolvency framework
. The NCLT highlighted two major issues:
absence of a reciprocal agreement
between India and the Netherlands made it impossible to enforce insolvency proceedings in the latter jurisdiction.
Sections 234 and 235,
which could have addressed these issues,
were deemed “dead letters” due to their non-operational status.
Although
an ad hoc cross-border insolvency protocol was developed
to coordinate proceedings between Indian and Dutch administrators,
this solution was neither sustainable nor efficient.
Recommendations for Reform
Adopting the UNCITRAL Model Law
The model law offers a structured and internationally recognised framework
for managing cross-border insolvencies.
Its adoption would enhance predictability, improve efficiency, and strengthen investor confidence in India’s insolvency regime.
Modernising Judicial Communication
Outdated communication methods between Indian and foreign courts
hinder the resolution of cross-border insolvency cases.
Implementing the Judicial Insolvency Network (JIN) Guidelines (2016) and its Modalities of Court-to-Court Communication (2018) would modernise judicial coordination
, enhance transparency, and streamline cross-border insolvency proceedings.
Expanding the Powers of the NCLT
Section 60(5) of the IBC restricts civil courts from exercising jurisdiction over insolvency matters,
making the NCLT the sole adjudicating authority.
the NCLT lacks the authority to recognize or enforce foreign judgments, limiting its effectiveness.
Expanding the NCLT’s powers and implementing Rule 11 of the NCLAT Rules
, 2016, would enable it to address cross-border insolvency issues comprehensively.
Conclusion
India’s economic integration
with the global market
necessitates a robust cross-border insolvency framework.
While the IBC has laid a strong foundation for managing domestic insolvencies,
its limitations in addressing cross-border cases remain a significant challenge.
Adopting the UNCITRAL Model Law, modernising judicial communication
, and empowering the NCLT are
crucial steps toward bridging this gap.

Editorial Analysis
**********China is building the world’s largest dam on the Tsangpo
Why in news?
China has approved the construction of the world’s largest hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, with a capacity of 60,000 MW, three times that of the Three Gorges Dam.
The river flows into Arunachal Pradesh as the Siang, into Assam as the Brahmaputra, and then into Bangladesh before reaching the Bay of Bengal.
The project is expected to have a significant impact on the livelihoods, ecology, and water availability for millions downstream.
India has consistently expressed concerns to China about such projects, emphasizing the need for transparency and consultation to protect downstream states’ interests.
What’s in today’s article?
Yarlung Tsangpo Project
Specific concerns for India
Existing coordination mechanism on transboundary rivers between India and China
Options available to India
About
The Yarlung Tsangpo hydropower project is set to be the world’s largest hydropower project, planned at the "
Great Bend" of the river in Medog county
, Tibet, where
it makes a U-turn before entering Arunachal Pradesh
The project is part of China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025).
Location and Planning Stage
According to experts, the project’s location has been strategically chosen. Recent activities, including funding allocation, construction of smaller dams, and changes in upstream land use, suggest the project is in an advanced planning phase, with visible construction expected soon.
China's Goals for the Yarlung Tsangpo Project
China aims to use the Yarlung Tsangpo project to reduce reliance on conventional energy sources and achieve net carbon neutrality by 2060.
The river’s steep descent from the mountains provides an ideal flow rate for hydroelectricity generation, making it a prime location for such a mega project.
Scale of China's Dams and Environmental Concerns
China’s recent dams, including the
, highlight the massive scale of its hydropower ambitions.
However, these projects have raised significant environmental concerns.
Three Gorges Dam, for instance, has altered gravity anomaly maps due to the immense weight of stored water
, caused severe ecological impacts, and even triggered earthquakes.
Additionally, over a million people were displaced due to changes in river morphology.
The Yarlung Tsangpo project could replicate these environmental and social risks on a larger scale, posing significant challenges for downstream regions.
Impact on Water Flow to India
The proposed dam could significantly affect water flow from China to India, a lower riparian state, as most of the water in the Brahmaputra system originates in Tibet.
Any alteration in water flow could disrupt agriculture and water availability in India.
Interruption of Silt and Biodiversity
Large dams often block the flow of silt, essential for agriculture, and cause changes in river flow, adversely affecting local biodiversity.
These disruptions could have long-term ecological and agricultural consequences for the region.
Earthquake-Prone and Fragile Ecology
The region is one of the most ecologically fragile and earthquake-prone areas in the world.
A large dam in this zone increases the risk of catastrophic events.
For instance, the 2004 Parechu Lake landslide in Tibet, which later burst in 2005, highlights the dangers of water accumulation in unstable regions, despite timely coordination to mitigate damage.
Need for Coordination and Concerns Over Cooperation
Effective coordination and real-time exchange of information between countries are crucial to prevent disasters.
However, China has shown reluctance to cooperate with lower riparian states like India.
Similar concerns have been observed in the Mekong river basin, where China’s 12 large dams have negatively impacted downstream nations.
India and China have several agreements for cooperation on transboundary rivers:
Umbrella MoU (2013):
Covers overall cooperation on transboundary rivers and has no expiry date. However, no activity is currently being undertaken under this agreement.
Brahmaputra MoU:
Signed for data sharing and renewable every five years. It lapsed in 2023, and its renewal is under process via diplomatic channels.
Sutlej MoU:
Initiated after the 2004 Parechu Lake incident but does not provide year-round data. This MoU is also pending renewal.
Expert Level Mechanism (2006)
This mechanism facilitates annual meetings between India and China to discuss transboundary river issues.
However, interruptions have occurred in recent years.
Challenges in Cooperation
China has been reluctant to share data consistently, with interruptions noted during the 2017 Doklam crisis and the 2020 Ladakh standoff.
International Framework
While neither India nor China is a signatory to the
1997 UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses
, both countries abide by its key principles.
These include equitable and reasonable water use and ensuring that actions of one country do not significantly harm another.
Need for Enhanced Cooperation
Given the limited avenues of coordination and the potential risks posed by mega projects like the Yarlung Tsangpo dam, robust mechanisms and renewed agreements are critical for preventing disputes and ensuring regional stability.
Limited Scope of Understanding
India and China have a narrow and limited understanding when it comes to transboundary river issues.
China has been unwilling to agree to any commitments that could address India’s concerns comprehensively.
China’s Standard Response
China often claims its hydropower projects are run-of-the-river, implying minimal water impounding and limited downstream impact.
However, India views these assertions sceptically.
India’s Need for Public Challenges
India must challenge China’s statements, including the recent claim that the Tsangpo mega dam would have no downstream impacts.
Without publicly countering such narratives, these projects could become faits accomplis, creating long-term challenges for India.
Honest Dialogue and Dissuasion
India should push for an honest dialogue with China and attempt to dissuade them from pursuing large-scale projects like the Tsangpo mega dam.
Elevating Water as a Key Issue
Water-related concerns should become a significant focus in India’s engagement with China.
India needs to clearly convey that disregarding its interests and concerns will negatively impact bilateral relations.

**********Transgender people can change their name and gender on birth certificates
Why in news?
Five years after the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 was enacted, the Karnataka High Court intervened to allow a transgender woman to change her name and gender on her birth certificate.
This step was necessary as she was earlier denied the change, despite such provisions being explicitly allowed under the 2019 Act and its rules.
What’s in today’s article?
Background of the case
Karnataka HC's Ruling
Application Process for Certificate of Identity
About
The act allows transgender individuals to obtain a "
certificate of identity
" (Section 6) and revise it after
sex-reassignment surgery
(Section 7).
The Act mandates that
gender recorded on this certificate must appear on all official documents
It also explicitly permits changing the first name and gender in the birth certificate and other identity documents based on this certificate.
Rules and Procedures Under the 2020 Rules
Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020
outline the procedure for obtaining the certificate and include a list of official documents eligible for revision, with the "Birth Certificate" as the first entry.
Ms. X vs. State of Karnataka (2024)
In  X vs. State of Karnataka (2024), the petitioner, diagnosed with gender dysphoria, underwent sex-reassignment surgery and changed her name to align her official documents with her gender identity.
She successfully updated her Aadhaar card, driving license, and passport but faced rejection when applying to change her name and gender on her birth certificate.
Registrar’s Rejection
The Registrar of Births and Deaths in Mangalore denied her request, citing
Section 15 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969
The provision permits changes to birth certificates only if the information is "erroneous" or entered "fraudulently or incorrectly."
Challenge in Karnataka High Court
The petitioner challenged the restrictive interpretation of Section 15, arguing that it curtailed her right to life with dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution.
She emphasized that inconsistent documentation creates a “dual life,” exposing her to harassment and discrimination.
State's Argument
The Karnataka government maintained that the Registrar was bound by the limitations of the 1969 Act, which does not explicitly allow changes for reasons like gender identity updates.
Conflict Between the 1969 Act and the 2019 Act
restricts changes to birth certificates to cases of “erroneous,” “fraudulent,” or “incorrect” entries (Section 15).
However, the Karnataka HC found this general law to be in conflict with the Transgender Persons Act, 2019, a special law aimed at protecting transgender rights.
Legal Principle: Special Law Prevails Over General Law
The HC applied the principle of generalia specialibus non-derogant ("the special shall prevail over the general"), holding that the specific provisions of the 2019 Act override the general provisions of the 1969 Act.
This interpretation ensures that the broader objectives of the 2019 Act are not obstructed by older general laws.
The Karnataka HC directed the Registrar to recognize certificates issued under the Transgender Persons Act and update birth certificates with the revised name and gender identity.
The court also emphasized that this must be followed “until suitable amendments are made to the 1969 Act.”
Transgender Persons Rules
, individuals must file an application with the District Magistrate (DM) along with an affidavit declaring their gender identity.
The DM will process the affidavit and issue an identification number as proof of application.
Within 30 days, the DM will either issue the certificate of identity and a transgender identity card or reject the application with reasons.
Revised Certificate for Post-Surgery Applicants
Transgender individuals who undergo reassignment surgery can request a medical certificate from the Medical Superintendent or Chief Medical Officer.
Using this medical certificate, they can reapply to the DM for a revised certificate of identity, which must be issued within 15 days.
Exemption for Pre-Act Changes
Individuals who recorded a change in gender before the Act came into force are not required to apply for a certificate of identity under the Act.
Obligation to Update Official Documents
Authorities responsible for issuing official documents (e.g., Aadhaar, driving license, birth certificate) must update the name, gender, photograph, or any related information within 15 days of receiving an application from a transgender person with a valid certificate of identity.

**********State of School Infrastructure and Enrolment in India
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, About USDISE+)
Key Highlights of the Report by USDISE (Basic Amenities, Challenges, etc.)
Conclusion
Introduction:
The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) highlights critical aspects of India’s school infrastructure and enrolment trends.
UDISE+ is one of the largest Management
Information Systems
initiated by Department of School
and Literacy, Ministry of
These findings shed light on both improvements and persistent challenges in the education system.
Single-Teacher and Zero Enrolment Schools:
The number of
single-teacher schools
in India has decreased from
1,18,190 in 2022-23 to 1,10,971 in 2023-24
, marking a reduction of
7,219 schools
This decline has also been accompanied by a drop in student enrolment in these schools, which fell from
47.43 lakh to 39.94 lakh
over the same period.
On the other hand, the number of schools with
zero enrolments
has seen a worrying increase.
From
10,294 schools in 2022-23
, the count rose to
12,954 schools in 2023-24
, an increase of
2,660 schools
. States such as
West Bengal (3,254 schools)
Rajasthan (2,167 schools)
, and
Telangana (2,097 schools)
report the highest numbers.
Officials attribute this phenomenon to the possibility of schools awaiting new batches of students; however, if enrolment fails to resume, these schools risk closure.
Basic Amenities in Schools:
Among India’s
14
71 lakh schools
, infrastructural gaps remain evident:
Electricity
1.52 lakh schools
still lack functional electricity.
Government schools account for the majority, with
9.12 lakh out of 10.17 lakh government schools
having functional electricity.
Drinking Water
While
14.47 lakh schools
claim to have drinking water facilities, only
14.11 lakh
have them functional.
Approximately
24,580 schools
lack any drinking water facility.
Toilets
14.50 lakh
have toilets, but
14.04 lakh
are functional.
Government schools constitute the majority of the
67,000 schools
operating without functional toilets.
Access for Differently-Abled Students:
Only
33
2% of government schools
have disabled-friendly toilets, and of these, only
30.6% are functional
77% of schools
have ramps, but just
3% have ramps with handrails
, limiting accessibility.
Technology & Co-Curricular Activities:
50% of schools
lack access to functional computers for teaching.
17.5% of schools
have dedicated arts and crafts rooms, with government schools lagging further at
9.9%
Among schools with secondary sections, only
1.6 lakh
2.86 lakh
have integrated science laboratories.
Renewable Energy Adoption:
The uptake of solar panels in schools is minimal, with only
1.54 lakh schools (10.5%)
equipped with solar energy systems.
Government schools fare worse, with only
8.8% (89,746 schools)
having installed solar panels.
Regional Disparities:
Madhya Pradesh
leads in the number of single-teacher schools (
13,198
), followed by Andhra Pradesh (
12,611
).
has the highest number of schools with zero enrolments, a trend that raises concerns about the viability of these institutions.
Conclusion:
While there have been some improvements, such as the decline in single-teacher schools, challenges like the rise in zero-enrolment schools, lack of basic amenities, and inadequate facilities for differently-abled students continue to persist.
Addressing these issues requires a focused approach involving infrastructure upgrades, increased teacher deployment, and better accessibility measures to ensure quality education for all.
The UDISE+ data serves as a vital tool to identify gaps and shape policies aimed at transforming India’s educational landscape.

**********India Secures 14.3% of Global Remittances in 2024: World Bank
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Significance of Remittances;
Why in the News?
In 2024, India received a record $129.1 billion in remittances which marked the highest share for any country since 2000 as per the World Bank.
What are the Trends in Remittances flow?
Record Inflows:
In 2024, India received an estimated $129.1 billion in remittances, marking the highest amount ever recorded for any country in a single year.
Global Share:
India accounted for 14.3% of global remittances, the highest share since the turn of the millennium.
Growth Rate:
The growth rate of remittances in 2024 was approximately 5.8%, a significant increase from 1.2% in 2023.
Top Recipients:
Following India, Mexico and China received the largest remittances, with Mexico at $68 billion and China at $48 billion.
What are the Factors Responsible for High Remittances in India?
Large Diaspora:
India has one of the largest diaspora populations globally, with over 18 million Indians living abroad, contributing significantly to remittance inflows.
Shift to High-Income Countries:
There has been a trend of Indian migrants moving to high-income economies such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, where job opportunities are more abundant.
Diverse Skill Levels:
Indian migrants include highly skilled professionals (in sectors like IT and healthcare) as well as semi-skilled and unskilled labourers, broadening the scope for remittance generation.
Recovery of Job Markets:
The recovery of job markets in high-income countries post-pandemic has driven an increase in remittance flows as employment opportunities have improved.
What is the significance of high Remittances?
Economic Support for Households:
Remittances serve as a crucial source of income for many families in India, supporting their daily needs and contributing to overall household welfare.
Impact on National Economy:
In 2024, remittances constituted approximately 3.3% of India’s GDP, highlighting their role in bolstering the economy.
Comparison with Other Financial Flows:
Remittances have outpaced other forms of external financial flows, such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Official Development Assistance (ODA), indicating their importance for funding current account deficits and fiscal shortfalls in low- and middle-income countries.
Long-Term Growth Trends:
Over the past decade, remittances to low-and-middle-income countries have increased by 57%, underscoring their growing significance as a stable source of income compared to declining FDI.
What are the negative impacts of brain drain?
Even though remittances are good for the country, they have negative signals for any country like brain drain.
Loss of Skilled Labor:
Brain drain leads to a significant depletion of skilled professionals in the home country, resulting in shortages in critical sectors such as healthcare, education, and technology.
This loss hampers the country’s ability to innovate and develop, as there are fewer qualified individuals to drive progress and maintain essential services.
Economic Consequences:
The exodus of skilled workers results in decreased tax revenues for the home country, which can limit public spending on infrastructure and social programs. This financial shortfall can stunt economic growth and development, exacerbating existing challenges within the economy.
Impeded National Development:
Countries experiencing brain drain may face slower overall development due to the loss of human capital. This can create a cycle of underdevelopment, where the lack of skilled labour leads to reduced investment opportunities and further emigration, perpetuating the cycle of talent loss and economic stagnation.
Way forward:
Enhance Domestic Opportunities:
Strengthen education, healthcare, and innovation ecosystems to retain skilled professionals by providing competitive salaries, career growth, and improved living standards.
Engage Diaspora Strategically:
Leverage the Indian diaspora for knowledge transfer, investments, and partnerships, creating pathways for their contribution to national development while maintaining ties with homegrown talent.
**********India, cross-border insolvency and legal reform
Security Issues
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to insolvency;
Why in the News?
The current state of cross-border insolvency laws is poor, with rules that cannot be enforced and slow progress in making necessary changes. This situation needs to be fixed.
How did the evolution of the cross-border insolvency framework in India?
Post-Independence Legal Framework
: After Independence, India’s insolvency laws focused on domestic cases and did not address cross-border insolvency, leaving a significant gap in the legal framework.
Committee Recommendations and IBC Drafting
: In the 2000s, committees like the Eradi, Mitra, and Irani Committees recommended adopting the UNCITRAL Model Law, leading to the drafting of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in 2015, which initially focused on domestic insolvencies.
Incorporation of Cross-Border Provisions
: Sections 234 and 235 were introduced in 2016 to facilitate cross-border insolvency, allowing reciprocal agreements and assistance from foreign courts, though their effectiveness was
limited by the lack of implementation and reciprocal arrangements.
What are the key challenges in adopting a cross-border insolvency framework in India?
Outdated Framework
: Current legal provisions, such as Sections 234 and 235 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), remain non-notified and unenforceable, rendering them ineffective. Reliance on ad hoc protocols like in the
Jet Airways case
increases judicial burden, delays resolutions, and reduces asset value.
Jurisdictional Issues
: Section 60(5) of the IBC limits the jurisdiction of civil courts over insolvency matters, leaving the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) as the sole authority. However, the NCLT lacks the power to recognize or enforce foreign judgments.
Lack of Reciprocal Arrangements
: The absence of reciprocal agreements between India and other nations for cross-border insolvency resolution creates barriers to effective cooperation.
Inefficient Court Communication
: Outdated communication methods between Indian and foreign courts hinder transparency and efficiency in handling cross-border insolvency matters.
Legislative Gaps
: The delay in adopting structured frameworks, such as the
, highlights a critical regulatory gap in managing cross-border insolvencies.
How does India’s proposed legislation align with international standards, such as the UNCITRAL Model Law?
India’s proposed amendments to the
aim to incorporate elements of the
UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency,
which provides a structured framework for international cooperation and coordination in insolvency matters.
By adopting this model, India seeks to enhance its legal framework to better manage cross-border insolvencies and align with global best practices.
The recommendations from various expert committees, including the
Insolvency Law Committee and the Parliamentary Standing Committee,
emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach that includes provisions for recognizing foreign insolvency proceedings and facilitating smoother communication between jurisdictions.
What implications do these reforms have for foreign investment and economic growth in India?
Attracting Foreign Investment:
A robust cross-border insolvency framework will enhance investor confidence by ensuring that their rights are protected in case of insolvency. This predictability is crucial for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) into India, as investors seek assurance that their interests will be managed effectively across borders.
Facilitating Corporate Restructuring:
Improved legal mechanisms for cross-border insolvency will enable Indian companies operating internationally to restructure more efficiently when faced with financial difficulties. This can lead to better asset recovery and preservation of business value, ultimately contributing to economic stability and growth.
Strengthening Economic Ties:
By aligning its insolvency laws with international standards, India can foster stronger economic relationships with other nations, facilitating smoother trade and investment flows. This alignment is essential as India’s economic integration with global markets continues to grow.
Way forward:
Adopt UNCITRAL Model Law:
Expedite the implementation of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency to establish a predictable, structured framework for managing international insolvency cases, fostering investor confidence and global integration.
Enhance NCLT Capacity:
Strengthen the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) with expanded jurisdiction and training to effectively handle cross-border insolvency cases, alongside modernizing judicial coordination mechanisms through international guidelines like JIN.

It uses advanced
water Cherenkov detectors
to study
high-energy neutrinos
and their origins, as well as fundamental neutrino properties.
Key Components:
ARCA (Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss):
Offshore Sicily, Italy, at
3,400 meters depth
, studying high-energy cosmic neutrinos.
ORCA (Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss):
Offshore Toulon, France, at
2,475 meters depth
, focusing on neutrino oscillations and mass hierarchy.
It detects
Cherenkov radiation
, faint light produced when neutrinos interact with water molecules, using
6,210 optical modules
Design:
Modular construction with plans to deploy
12,000 optical modules
600 vertical strings
, anchored to the seabed.
Connected via electro-optical networks to shore stations for power and data processing.
About Neutrinos
are subatomic particles,
similar to electrons
but
without an electric charge
Neutrinos are the
most abundant particles
in the universe after Photons.
Approximately
a billion neutrinos pass through a cubic centimetre of space every second
First detected in
1959
, though their existence was theorized in
1931
High-energy neutrinos, which originate from
exotic astrophysical events
like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, or colliding stars, are of particular interest to scientists because:
Neutrinos can travel through dense cosmic environments, such as the
dust-shrouded centre of the Milky Way
, where visible light telescopes fail.
Neutrino detection depends on observing
— light flashes produced when neutrinos interact with water or ice molecules.
Darkness is essential
for detecting the faint flashes of Cherenkov radiation.
Why study neutrinos?
Neutrinos provide insights into particle physics, including neutrino oscillations and mass hierarchy, challenging the Standard Model.
Neutrinos pass through dense cosmic regions, offering access to areas invisible to traditional telescopes.
Studying neutrinos aids in tracing cosmic ray origins and understanding dark matter, unlocking mysteries of the universe.
