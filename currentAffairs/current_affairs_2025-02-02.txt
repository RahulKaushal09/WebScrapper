About Composite Material:
A composite material is
made up of two or more materials with different chemical and physical properties.
A composite material is used to
enhance the properties of its base materials.
The materials which form the composite are also called constituents or
constituent materials.
The material properties achieved by
purposeful material combinations
can give composites advantages that cannot be achieved by conventional single engineering materials.

**********A Union Budget that Ticks Most of the Boxes
Context
The
Union Budget for FY26
has been presented against
a backdrop of both domestic and global economic challenges.
While India’s economy is currently experiencing a cyclical slowdown,
marked by weakening urban consumption, slow job growth, and an investment cycle that is yet to become broad-based,
the country’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong.
With geopolitical uncertainty and global trade disruptions looming,
the government has taken a pragmatic approach to fiscal management, aiming to sustain economic stability
while fostering growth.
Therefore,
it is important to explore the key themes of the budget, including fiscal discipline, personal taxation reforms, capital expenditure (capex) allocations, and structural measures for long-term economic resilience.
The Primary Focus of Union Budget 2025-26:
Macroeconomic Stability Amidst Global Challenges
second half of FY25 is expected to witness a rebound in Gross Value Added (GVA) growth,
core inflation remains benign, and the current account deficit is under control due to strong services exports.
Unlike many other economies
, particularly in Europe and Latin America,
India benefits from relative political and economic stability,
which bolsters investor confidence.
Recognising the importance of macroeconomic stability
, the finance minister has prioritised fiscal prudence.
A key highlight of the budget is
the reduction in the fiscal deficit target, from 4.8% of GDP in the current year to 4.4% in FY26.
This
move signals the unwinding of the post-pandemic fiscal stimulus
, preserving policy space for future needs.
Additionally,
the government has maintained a tight rein on the revenue deficit, projected at 1.9% and 1.5% of GDP for FY25 and FY26
, respectively, both lower than pre-pandemic levels.
This has been achieved through improved revenue receipts and controlled discretionary spending.
By containing inflationary pressures and reducing fiscal vulnerabilities,
India strengthens its case for a potential sovereign credit rating upgrade
, which would enhance investor confidence.
Personal Income Tax Reforms and Their Implications
Boosting Disposable Income and Consumption
By reducing the personal income tax burden,
the government is putting more money in the hands of middle-class and salaried individuals.
increase in disposable income is expected to translate into higher spending on goods
and services, thereby stimulating demand across various sectors.
In particular, sectors such as retail, consumer durables, automobiles, and discretionary services
(such as travel, entertainment, and hospitality) could see a positive impact.
Encouraging Investments in Real Estate
Beyond direct consumption benefits,
the budget introduces a significant tax incentive related to housing.
The enhancement of tax benefits for self-occupied properties,
allowing individuals to claim tax benefits on two houses instead of just one,
is expected to stimulate the real estate sector.
Real estate is a highly influential sector in the Indian economy
due to its extensive backward and forward linkages.
Increased investment in housing leads to higher demand for construction materials
such as cement, steel, and bricks, thereby benefiting allied industries.
real estate development generates employment opportunities for construction workers, engineers, architects, and skilled labourers
, leading to broad-based economic gains.
Potential Risks and Challenges
While the reduction in personal income tax has clear benefits,
it also presents certain risks and challenges.
One key concern
is whether the tax cut will lead to a sustainable increase in consumption or if consumers will opt to save the additional income
If a
significant portion of the tax savings is diverted toward savings
rather than spending, the expected stimulus effect on consumption may be weaker than anticipated.
the revenue forgone due to the tax cuts (₹1 trillion) could create fiscal constraints in the future.
government has sought to offset this loss by controlling discretionary revenue expenditures.
However,
if economic growth does not accelerate as expected, the lower revenue collection could pose challenges to fiscal management,
potentially requiring adjustments in future budgets.
Some Other Key Themes of Budget FY26
Capital Expenditure and Investment Outlook
While some market analysts expressed concerns over the perceived reduction in capital expenditure,
a closer examination suggests that this is a temporary shift rather than a structural cut.
revised capex allocation for FY25 was lowered from 3.4% to 3.1% of GDP
, largely due to delays caused by the 2024 general elections.
the government’s disbursement of ₹1.72 trillion in December 2024, the highest-ever monthly capex disbursal,
indicates a strong commitment to infrastructure spending.
For FY26, the capex budget remains steady at 3.1% of GDP
, ensuring policy continuity.
Importantly, the capex-to-revenue expenditure (revex) ratio is set to increase to 28.4%, the highest in over two decades.
This suggests an emphasis on quality fiscal spending
, favouring long-term growth over short-term consumption.
Sectoral Initiatives and Industrial Growth
These include
the enhancement of classification thresholds for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)
, the creation of national manufacturing and export promotion missions, and the establishment of an investment-friendliness index for states.
, labour-intensive sectors such as agriculture, leather, toys, tourism, and hospitality have received targeted policy support.
By encouraging domestic manufacturing and exports,
these measures aim to bolster economic resilience, reduce dependence on imports
, and create employment opportunities.
The focus on ease of doing business and tax simplification is another noteworthy step
that could enhance India’s attractiveness for both domestic and foreign investors.
The Long-Term Fiscal Strategy and Debt Management
Beyond immediate fiscal measures,
the budget hints at a long-term fiscal policy strategy
government plans to transition to a debt-targeting framework from FY27, aiming to reduce central government debt to 49%-51% of GDP by FY31
, down from the projected 56.1% in FY26.
While this approach allows flexibility in fiscal management,
it could also introduce volatility in financial markets, depending on the execution and investor perceptions.
The Economic Survey’s influence
A holistic feature
of FY26 Budget
lies beyond the numbers it projects.
Intangible gains
could be reaped, which if implemented and executed well,
would boost productivity levels in the economy in the longer run.
A focus on next generation ease of doing business measures, a simplification of the tax architecture
(including various decriminalisation measures), and migration towards a light-touch regulatory framework in the non-financial sector are some of the steps
that appear to have been influenced by the Economic Survey.
Conclusion
The Union Budget for FY26 strikes a careful balance
between fiscal consolidation and economic support.
While addressing immediate concerns such as urban consumption and investment sentiment,
it also lays the groundwork for long-term economic resilience
through prudent fiscal management, strategic capex allocations, and structural reforms.
the effectiveness of these measures will depend on their execution, particularly in sustaining private sector investments and job growth.

Editorial Analysis
**********Viksit Bharat and the Budget’s Play with Numbers
Context
The
Budget 2025-26 presents significant challenges for the Narendra Modi government in its third term
, particularly in addressing slowing economic growth, income disparity, and declining domestic demand.
While
the government attempts to balance fiscal consolidation with populist measures,
contradictions emerge in its policies,
particularly concerning corporate incentives, tax concessions, and social welfare spending.
Now it becomes imperative to critically evaluate the key aspects of the budget and its potential implications.
An Analysis of Economic Slowdown and Weak Demand Highlighted by Economic Survey 2024-25
Declining Consumption Demand
Rising Income Disparity
Economic Survey explicitly acknowledges that income disparity is increasing
, leading to subdued demand.
wealth generated in the economy has disproportionately benefited large corporations,
whose profits have reached a 15-year high, while wage growth has been moderate, and job creation has remained tepid.
This
imbalance means that while businesses are earning more, the purchasing power of the lower- and middle-income groups has not increased significantly
, leading to weak demand for goods and services.
End of Credit-Fuelled Consumption
In recent years, credit expansion, particularly in the form of personal loans and easy financing options, temporarily boosted household consumption.
However,
this model of growth is unsustainable in the long run.
As borrowing increases, so do household debt burdens
, leading to a slowdown in discretionary spending.
With interest rates remaining relatively high and consumers becoming more cautious about debt
, this source of demand growth is now weakening.
Inflationary Pressures
Persistent inflation in essential commodities
such as food and fuel has further reduced real disposable incomes.
headline inflation may appear under control, core inflation
(which excludes volatile items like food and fuel)
remains a concern.
Higher living costs mean that consumers prioritise essential spending
over discretionary purchases, reducing demand for industries such as automobiles, consumer durables, and real estate.
Declining Public Capital Expenditure
Lower-than-Expected Capital Expenditure Growth
While the government had initially projected a 20% increase in effective capital expenditure,
actual spending rose by only 5% in nominal terms, which translates to a decline in real terms when adjusted for inflation.
This is concerning because public infrastructure investment typically has a high multiplier effect
, meaning that for every rupee spent, the economy benefits multiple times over.
slowdown in government investment results in weaker job creation,
lower industrial activity, and reduced private sector confidence.
Fiscal Conservatism and Revenue Constraints
Despite having access to exceptional revenue sources
, such as dividends from public sector enterprises, spectrum sales, and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surpluses,
the government has chosen a path of fiscal restraint.
Lower-than-expected tax revenues
and a commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit have led to spending cuts,
especially in capital-intensive sectors.
This approach,
while aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability, may have short-term negative effects on growth.
Weak Private Investment and Corporate Behaviour
Corporate Profits vs. Investment
Although
corporate profits have surged to a 15-year high
has not translated into increased capital investments.
Instead of expanding production or creating new jobs, many companies are holding onto their cash reserves
, distributing dividends, or engaging in share buybacks.
suggests that businesses are uncertain about future demand
, which discourages new investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, or employment.
Global Uncertainty and Weak External Trade
Global economic conditions have also contributed to lower private investment
sluggish global growth, geopolitical tensions, and policy shifts in major economies
(such as the U.S. under the post-Trump administration),
Indian exports are not expected to be a major driver of growth.
This leaves the domestic economy with fewer external growth engines, further
necessitating an increase in domestic demand and investment
, something that is currently missing.
Key Aspects of Budget 2025-26 to Address the Slowdown and Their Implications
Tax Concessions and Middle-Class Appeal
A key feature of the budget is the
increase in the tax-free income threshold from ₹7 lakh to ₹12.75 lakh
, providing substantial relief to middle-income earners.
While this move
strengthens the government’s appeal among the middle class
, it comes at a cost—
a projected loss of ₹1 lakh crore in direct tax revenues
This decision underscores the government’s focus on
vote-bank politics
rather than broader economic reforms.
To compensate for this revenue loss, the government has committed to
reducing the fiscal deficit from 4.8% of GDP in 2024-25 to 4.4% in 2025-26
However, this commitment
limits the scope for increased government expenditure
, further constraining economic recovery.
Corporate Incentives and Income Disparity
The budget reflects a
contradictory stance on corporate incentives and economic growth
On the one hand, the
Economic Survey acknowledges that rising income inequality weakens demand and investment
, yet the budget continues to favour
through tax concessions and regulatory reforms.
For example, the government believes that
reducing corporate tax burdens and easing regulations will boost private investment
However, with
stagnant wages and underutilized industrial capacity
, this assumption may not hold.
The paradox is evident: while acknowledging that rising profits at the expense of worker earnings harms demand, the budget still bets on
corporate-led investment to drive growth
Foreign Investment and Risks
The budget extends
similar incentives to foreign investors
, including
raising the foreign direct investment (FDI) ceiling in the insurance sector from 74% to 100%
While this move is aimed at attracting more investment, it carries risks—particularly in sectors like insurance, where foreign firms may
prioritize profits over consumer welfare
Additionally, the government plans to
revise India’s bilateral investment treaty template to be more investor-friendly
This shift could make India more vulnerable to
legal disputes with transnational corporations
, limiting its policy flexibility in the long run.
Given the
uncertain global economic climate
, relying on foreign investment as a key growth driver
appears risky.
Conclusion
The Budget 2025-26 attempts to balance economic recovery with fiscal discipline
, but its contradictions are evident.
While it acknowledges the need to revive domestic demand and address income disparity, it prioritises corporate incentives
and middle-class tax benefits over broader structural reforms.
Ultimately,
the budget reflects a political strategy rather than an economic roadmap, aimed at consolidating middle-class support
while maintaining corporate-friendly policies.
Whether this approach succeeds in reviving economic growth
or deepens existing structural issues
remains to be seen.

**********Union Budget 2025: India Adopts Debt-GDP Ratio as Key Fiscal Anchor
Why in the News?
The central government has announced the shift towards “debt-GDP ratio” as the fiscal anchor beginning from 2026-27 financial year.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Debt-GDP Ratio (Rationale Behind Shift, Fiscal Consolidation Strategies, Impact of Fiscal Deficit, Concerns, etc.)
Background:
In a significant shift in
fiscal policy
, the Indian government has announced that it will replace the
fiscal deficit target
with the
debt-to-GDP ratio
as the primary fiscal anchor from
FY 2026-27
This move aims to ensure
fiscal sustainability
, enhance
transparency
, and provide
greater flexibility
in managing public finances.
The government has set a long-term target of
reducing the central government’s debt-GDP ratio to 50±1% by March 31, 2031
Debt-GDP Ratio: A New Fiscal Approach
measures the share of a country's national debt in relation to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It serves as a
reliable indicator of fiscal health
, capturing both
past and present borrowing trends
According to the
, the central government’s
is projected to:
57.1% in FY 2024-25
(Revised Estimate)
56. 1% in FY 2025-26
Declining towards 50% by FY 2031
The move aligns with
global best practices
and ensures a
long-term fiscal consolidation strategy
rather than focusing solely on
annual deficit reduction
Rationale for the Shift to Debt-GDP Ratio:
More Reliable Fiscal Performance Measure
: It captures the cumulative effects of past fiscal policies, unlike the annual fiscal deficit target, which provides a short-term snapshot.
Greater Fiscal Transparency
: The new approach aims to reduce
off-budget borrowings
and improve clarity in public debt reporting.
Operational Flexibility
: It allows the government to respond to
economic shocks and unforeseen developments
more effectively than rigid annual deficit targets.
Debt Sustainability and Growth
: A structured debt-reduction path will create
fiscal space for productive investments
in infrastructure, social welfare, and economic development.
Fiscal Consolidation Strategies: Mild, Moderate, and High Approaches
To achieve the
debt-GDP reduction target
, the government has outlined
three scenarios
based on different nominal GDP growth rates:
This approach allows flexibility in choosing
mild, moderate, or aggressive
fiscal consolidation, balancing
growth needs
debt sustainability
Impact on Fiscal Deficit:
The fiscal deficit target for FY
is estimated at
4.8% of GDP
, lower than the original target of
4.9%
. For FY
, the government has projected a further reduction to
4.4% of GDP
Under a
moderate fiscal consolidation strategy
, the fiscal deficit is expected to decline:
4.4% in FY 2026
3.5% in FY 2031
While this represents a
gradual improvement
, experts caution that reaching the
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act target
40% debt-GDP ratio
will take longer than expected.
Expert Analysis and Concerns:
Longer Transition Period
: Experts argue that achieving a
will require
several decades
, raising concerns about
delayed fiscal commitments
Private Sector Borrowing Constraints
: With a
fiscal deficit of 4.4%
and state governments contributing an additional
3.3%
, there is
limited room
for private and non-governmental sector borrowing. This could lead to increased
foreign borrowing and higher current account deficits
Fiscal Space for Growth
: The transition to a debt-based fiscal strategy is expected to
free up resources
infrastructure investments, welfare programs, and innovation-driven initiatives
Conclusion:
marks a
major shift in India’s fiscal policy
, replacing fiscal deficit targets with a
more flexible and transparent debt-GDP ratio approach
While this strategy provides
long-term fiscal stability
, its success depends on
effective fiscal management
global economic conditions
The challenge remains in achieving
sustainable debt reduction
while ensuring
adequate investment in development and economic expansion
India’s ability to strike this balance will define the success of this
fiscal transformation

**********Balancing Growth and Stability - A Critical Analysis of the Union Budget 2025-26
Context:
The government’s first full budget in its third term had to balance
two conflicting objectives:
ensuring macroeconomic stability amid global challenges while supporting domestic growth.
The Global Economic Backdrop:
The global financial environment is
tightening due to US exceptionalism
, rising dollar value, and persistent high US interest rates.
A new trade
war, with the US imposing tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, threatens to further destabilize emerging markets.
Given this backdrop,
a conservative fiscal approach was needed
to ensure India’s resilience.
Domestic Economic Challenges:
Growth in India has slowed
, and the ongoing earnings season suggests a
delayed recovery.
A global slowdown could further impact domestic growth, making fiscal support essential.
The trade-off
was between fiscal prudence and allowing for increased government spending.
Fiscal Consolidation:
Strategy:
The government opted for conservatism, setting the
fiscal deficit at 4.8% of GDP
, lower than expected.
The budget outlines a
further reduction to 4.4% of GDP next year
, continuing a trend of fiscal consolidation.
A buffer against external shocks should be provided
by fiscal credibility, a healthy current account deficit and foreign exchange reserves, and
inflation
that is expected to return to 4%.
Strong fiscal discipline
is expected to enhance macroeconomic stability and credibility.
Costs of fiscal conservatism:
Lower fiscal deficits constrain government spending in the coming months.
Public spending (excluding interest payments) grew by 23% last quarter but will have to slow to 8% in the last quarter of the fiscal year.
A reduction in government spending may negatively impact economic growth,
shifting the responsibility to monetary policy.
Tax Cuts and Their Trade-offs:
The budget introduced
a tax cut worth 0.3% of GDP
to boost urban consumption.
However, fiscal consolidation largely relied on revenue expenditure compression rather than tax revenue augmentation.
Lower expenditure multipliers might impact overall economic stimulus.
The Role of Tax Buoyancy:
Tax buoyancy dropped from 1.4 in 2023-24 to 1.1 due to slower growth.
The budget assumes a higher tax buoyancy of 1.3,
which may not materialize.
If tax targets are missed, policymakers should allow the deficit to widen rather than further cutting expenditures.
Public Investment and Growth:
Central capital expenditure has
nearly doubled over four years
but fell short of targets this year.
State capital expenditure is also lagging as states prioritize subsidies.
Maintaining public investment is crucial
for sustaining growth and requires enhanced execution capacity.
Way Forward:
The need for structural reforms:
Fiscal stimulus
has been the primary driver of growth over the last five years.
Future fiscal space will shrink
, necessitating a shift toward private investment.
Policy measures must provide demand visibility and boost investor confidence ("
animal spirits
").
Reform agenda for sustainable growth:
The Economic Survey 2024-25 advocates for
deregulation and liberalization
to lower transaction costs and enhance global competitiveness.
Employment-focused reforms are needed
, particularly in labour-intensive sectors.
nvesting in health, education, and skilling
is essential to boost labour-intensive growth and increase consumption.
Industrial policy should prioritize
labour-intensive industries
and rationalize labour laws.
Conclusion - A Reform Stimulus Over Fiscal Stimulus:
The budget signals that India lacks space for further fiscal stimulus.
The solution lies in a reform stimulus to attract private investment and sustain long-term growth.
Balancing macroeconomic stability with growth requires structural changes, especially in a volatile global economic environment.
