Jagannath Temple
Three Indian cricket team players visited the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri recently, a day before the second ODI against England.
About Jagannath Temple:
It is a
Hindu temple
located in
Puri, Odisha.
It is dedicated to
Lord Jagannath
, a form of the
Hindu deity Vishnu.
It is believed to have been
built during
the reign of
King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, in the 12th century.
However, the completion of the temple happened in 1230 AD under Anangbheema Deva III, who also installed the deities in the shrine.
Architecture
It is a striking example of
Kalinga architecture
, a distinct Nagara style prevalent in Odisha.
The temple complex includes shrines, gardens and sacred tanks, creating a serene atmosphere for devotion.
The main temple is located at the center of the inner courtyard on a raised platform.
The main temple is constructed in such a way that no shadow of the temple falls on the ground at any time of the day.
The temple’s main structure, the sanctum sanctorum, or the garbhagriha, houses the idols of
Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra
At the pinnacle of the temple,
there is a 20-foot-high chakra (wheel)
that is positioned in a way to be visible from any part of the city.
Ratha Yatra
is a Hindu f
estival associated with Lord Jagannath temple.
one of the four
sacred pilgrimage sites, known as the
Char Dhams,
that hold great significance for Hindus.
It is also a
UNESCO World Heritage Site.

**********What is Graphene?
Researchers recently discovered a strange new state of matter in the dynamics of currents flowing through layers of graphene.
About Graphene:
It is an
allotrope of carbon,
along with diamond and graphite.
two-dimensional material
consisting of a
single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure.
The
stacked form
is graphite.
Graphene was first isolated in 2004. Since then, it has utilised in various innovative
applications, from sensors and electronics to energy storage and healthcare.
Properties
Thickness
: Graphene is the
world's thinnest material
– it is only one atom thick, one million times thinner than a human hair.
Strength
: It is
200 times stronger than steel
but
six times lighter.
Flexibility
extremely flexible and stretchable.
Conductivity
: It is an
excellent electrical and thermal conductor.
Transparency

**********What are Neutrinos?
Chinese scientists recently placed special detectors deep in the South China Sea to explore the possibility of building a huge underwater observatory to find neutrinos.
About Neutrinos:
Also called
ghost particles
, neutrinos are
nearly massless, electrically neutral subatomic particles
that
interact extremely weakly with matter.
Their tendency not to interact very often with other particles
makes detecting them very difficult.
First predicted in 1930, they weren’t discovered in experiments until 1956, and scientists thought they were massless until recently.
They
belong to the family of particles called leptons
, which are not subject to the
strong force.
Rather, neutrinos are
subject to the weak force
that underlies certain processes of radioactive decay.
Source
: Neutrinos come from all kinds of different sources and are often the
product of heavy particles turning into lighter ones,
a process
called “decay.”
They are the
most common particles in the universe.
Approximately 100 trillion neutrinos pass completely harmlessly through your body every second.
Neutrinos play crucial roles in the
standard model of particle physics
, in stellar physics and black holes, and even in cosmology and the nature of the Big Bang.

**********Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Act (CLNDA), 2010
Union government’s recent announcement that it would amend the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Act (CLNDA), 2010, and the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, is likely to enthuse American and French nuclear power companies, whose projects have been deadlocked due to legal concerns for more than 15 years.
About Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Act (CLNDA), 2010:
It is the legal foundation that influences India’s response to nuclear incidents. It was adopted by Parliament of India in 2010.
It is based on the international principles of civil nuclear liability laid down in the
Vienna Convention, Paris Convention
Brussels Supplementary Convention.
It created
a mechanism for compensating victims
from damage caused by a nuclear accident, allocating liability and specifying procedures for compensation.
Features:
The CLNDA provides for
strict and no-fault liability on the operator
of the nuclear plant, where it will be held liable for damage regardless of any fault on its part.
This Act establishes the
operator’s liability
for nuclear catastrophes
up to 1,500 crores
, which
requires insurance or financial security.
In case the damage claims exceed ₹1,500 crore,
the CLNDA expects the
government to step in.
The Act has
limited the government liability
amount to the rupee equivalent of 300 million Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or
about ₹2,100 to ₹2,300 crore.
In addition to establishing a timeline for compensation claims, the act authorises the
Atomic Energy Regulatory Board
to report incidents within 15 days.
In addition, the Act
establishes a Nuclear Damage Claims Commission
to facilitate equitable compensation and conflict resolution.

**********Salamander
Researchers discovered that wandering salamanders can rapidly fill, trap, and drain the blood in their toe tips to optimise attachment, detachment and general locomotion through their arboreal environment.
About
Salamander:
It is an
amphibian
with a slender body and a long tail.
Features:
Their size varies with different species, ranging from 2.5 cm to 20 cm. The largest salamander in the world is the Chinese Giant Salamander, which can grow up to a length of 5 feet.
Most salamanders
look like
cross between a lizard and a frog
. They have moist, smooth skin, like frogs, and long tails, like lizards.
They are
nocturnal
and cold-blooded
species and their temperature changes with their habitat.
Some salamander species
can be poisonous
, and some even have teeth.
capable of regenerating lost limbs
within a few weeks, including tails and toes, allowing them to survive attacks from predators.
Habitat:
They live in or
near water
or find shelter on moist ground and are typically found in brooks, creeks, ponds, and other moist locations, such as under rocks.
Distribution:
They are mainly found in
North America, Europe, Asia
, the northern parts of South America and North Africa.
Highlights of the research:
The researchers have uncovered that the wandering salamanders can finely
control and regulate
blood flow
to each side of their toe tips.
This allows them to
adjust pressure asymmetrically
, improving grip on irregular surfaces like tree bark.
The blood rushing in before “toe off” appears to help salamanders detach rather than attach. By slightly inflating the toe tip, the salamanders reduce the surface area in contact with the surface they are on, minimising the energy required to let go.
Significance:
Insights into salamander toe mechanics could ultimately inform the
development of adhesives, prosthetics, and even robotic appendages.

**********Algorithmic Trading
Recently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has mandated stock exchanges to empanel algorithmic trading providers and has also defined rules for using application programming interfaces (APIs).
About
Algorithmic Trading:
It is a method of
executing trading orders
by providing a predefined set of rules
to a computer program.
This helps in placing share orders at a speed and frequency not possible for human traders.
Algo trading is already prevalent in India among both
institutional as well as retail investors
New Algo Trading Framework by SEBI:
It is aimed at spelling out the
rights and responsibilities of the main stakeholders
of the trading ecosystem such as investors, brokers, algo providers/vendors and Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) so that the retail investors can avail algo facilities with requisite safeguards.
Under the framework,
retail investors will get access
to the approved algos
only from the registered brokers.
The facility of algo trading would be provided by the stock broker
only after obtaining requisite permission
from the stock exchange for each algo.
All algo orders shall be
tagged with a unique identifier
provided by the exchange in order to establish audit trail and the broker shall seek approval from the exchange for any modification or change to the approved algos,"
Brokers
will be solely responsible for
handling investor grievances
related to algo trading and the monitoring of APIs for prohibited activities.
Algos will be categorised
into two categories
White box algos,

**********Bombay Blood Group
Recently, in a rare and complex medical procedure, a 30-year-old woman with the extremely rare ‘Bombay’ (hh) blood group underwent a successful kidney transplant in India.
About
Bombay Blood Group:
The Bombay, also known as HH, blood group is a
rare blood group
first discovered in Mumbai in 1952 by Y.M. Bhende.
The Bombay blood group lacks A, B and H antigens, which are found in the common ABO blood groups.
In normal individuals, the H antigen serves as the base structure for
building A and B antigens
. In Bombay blood group individuals, the
gene responsible for producing the H antigen
mutated or absent,
so neither A nor B antigens can be formed.
Consequently, the people with Bombay Blood Group are
incompatible with all standard blood types
, including O-negative, complicating both transfusions and organ transplants.
They can only receive blood from another Bombay blood group donor. Its prevalence is about 0.0004% (one in 4 million) of the total human population.
While it drops to
one in a million in the European population
one in 10,000 in Mumbai
, the act of finding a donor is still daunting.

**********Kashmir Hand-knotted Carpet
Recently, the Geographical Indications Registry Chennai has granted a new logo for the Kashmir hand-knotted carpet in order to preserve the exclusivity of the famed Kashmir carpets.
About
Kashmir Hand-knotted Carpet:
The origin of hand
knotted carpets, locally known as "Kal baffi"
dates back to 15th century after which it progressively attained the high degree of perfection.
It is said that
Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin
brought carpet weavers
from Persia and central Asia
in to Kashmir to train the local inhabitants.
The loom used in Kashmir carpet weaving is composed of
two horizontal wooden beams
between which the wrap threads are stretched, one beam in front of the weaver and the second behind the first.
The difference between a carpet and other hand woven rugs lies in the fact that short
lengths of the thread
or yarn are tied to wrap chains to form the pile of the carpet. These are commonly called knots though it is a loop rather than an actual knot.
In Kashmir, the primary type of knot used in carpet weaving is called the "
Farsi baff
" or the "Sehna" knot, which is a Persian system of knotting.
Very simple tools are used to thread these knots -
a wood or a metal comb
to push knots and weft tightly together and a
pair of short scissors
to cut the pile of the carpet to an even form once it is finished.
Other GI tagged Kashmir crafts:
Apart from the hand-knotted carpet, six other crafts have already been GI registered, which include
Papier Mache, Kashmir Pashmina, Kani, Sozni, Khatamband
Walnut Wood Carving.

**********Bifurcation of Major Revenue-Generating Railway Zone: Reasons and Implications
Why in news?
The Union Cabinet approved the creation of the
South Coast Railway (SCoR) Zone
, the 18th railway zone of India, under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014.
PM Modi laid the foundation stone for its headquarters in Visakhapatnam in January. The new zone is formed by reorganizing parts of the East Coast Railway and South Central Railway.
Additionally, the Waltair Railway Division was split, with one part renamed as the Visakhapatnam Railway Division under SCoR, while the other part will become a new division based in Rayagada, Odisha, under the East Coast Railway.
What’s in today’s article?
Reason for Creating the South Coast Railway (SCoR) Zone
Divisions Under the South Coast Railway (SCoR) Zone
Significance of the Waltair Division
Mandate Under Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014
As per Item 8 of Schedule 13 (Infrastructure) of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, Indian Railways was required to examine the feasibility of a new railway zone.
Government Announcement and Strategic Importance
In February 2019, the Central government announced the creation of the South Coast Railway Zone.
It was done to enhance operational efficiency and cater to increasing passenger and freight demands.
Economic and Logistic Benefits
According to a senior railway official, the new zone will:
support industrial and agricultural growth,
improve logistics for major ports like Visakhapatnam and Krishnapatnam, and
boost tourism to Tirupati and other cultural sites in Andhra Pradesh.
Political Context
Despite a long-standing demand for a separate railway zone after Andhra Pradesh’s bifurcation, it was fulfilled only after political alignment between the state and the Centre.
The ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which came to power in 2024, is part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre.
Geographical Coverage
The SCoR zone will primarily cover Andhra Pradesh, along with parts of Telangana and Tamil Nadu.
Key Railway Divisions
Vijayawada Division (from South Central Railway)
Guntur Division (from South Central Railway)
Visakhapatnam Division (part of the former Waltair Division)
Sections Under Visakhapatnam Division (SCoR)
This division will cover approximately
410 km
, including sections:
Palasa–Visakhapatnam–Duvvada
Kuneru–Vizianagaram
Naupada Jn.–Paralakhemundi
Bobbili Jn.–Salur
Simhachalam North–Duvvada bypass
Vadalapudi–Duvvada
Visakhapatnam Steel Plant–Jaggayapalem
Rayagada Division Under East Coast Railway
The remaining part of the Waltair Division (around
680 km
) will be reorganized as a new division with headquarters at
, covering sections:
Kottavalasa–Bacheli
Kuneru–Theruvali Jn.
Singapur Rd.–Koraput Jn.
Paralakhemundi–Gunpur
Major Revenue Generator
The Waltair Division is a key revenue source for Indian Railways due to its strong freight traffic, primarily linked to the mining and steel industries in Odisha and Chhattisgarh.
Freight Performance of East Coast Railway (ECoR)
FY 2023-24
, ECoR set a record by loading
250 million tonnes
of freight, surpassing the previous year’s record.
Division-wise Contribution
Khurda Road Division
: 156.17 million tonnes
: 74.66 million tonnes
Sambalpur Division
: 19.20 million tonnes
ECoR became the
first railway zone
to exceed
200 million tonnes of freight loading
for five consecutive years.
Political Opposition in Odisha
Leaders from Odisha have opposed the reorganization, arguing that Odisha will suffer economic losses.
This is because a major revenue-generating part of ECoR, headquartered in
Bhubaneswar
, is being transferred to the South Coast Railway.

**********India’s Nuclear Liability Law: Key Amendments and Global Impact
Why in the News?
The Central government has announced that it would amend its Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Act and the Atomic Energy Act.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Nuclear Liability Law (Reasons for Amendment, Challenges, Global & Economic Impact, etc.)
Introduction:
Ahead of
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the U.S. and France
, the Indian government has announced plans to
amend its Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) and the Atomic Energy Act
These changes aim to resolve long-standing concerns of
American and French nuclear power companies
, whose projects in India have remained stalled due to liability issues.
This announcement marks a
significant policy shift
from the government’s 2015 stance, where it had categorically stated there was
"no proposal to amend the Act or Rules"
Now, the amendments could facilitate the implementation of major nuclear projects, such as:
Electricité de France (EDF)’s MoU to build six EPR1650 reactors in Maharashtra (Jaitapur)
Westinghouse Electric Company’s MoU to build six AP1000 reactors in Andhra Pradesh (Kovvada)
Additionally, India plans to leverage
Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology
, which is gaining traction in developed economies.
Reasons for India to Amend Its Nuclear Liability Law:
Addressing Foreign Companies’ Concerns
Western nuclear power firms have
hesitated to invest in India
due to strict liability clauses in the
CLNDA, 2010
, which place
a high degree of responsibility on suppliers
for nuclear accidents.
This contrasts with the
international Convention for Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC)
, which primarily holds
operators
The current law was introduced after intense
parliamentary debates in 2012
, where opposition parties—then led by the NDA—insisted on supplier liability, citing disasters like the
Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984)
Fukushima Nuclear Leak (2011)
However, this has
discouraged investment from U.S. and French firms
, who see India’s liability norms as
a major financial risk
Expanding India’s Nuclear Energy Capacity
current nuclear power capacity
stands at
6,780 MW
, comprising
22 reactors
, with
Russia’s Rosatom
being the
only foreign operator
in the country.
2025 Budget
has proposed a
₹20,000 crore allocation
for nuclear energy development, with an ambitious target of
100 GW nuclear power capacity by 2047
India is keen on
developing Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
, with five units planned for operationalization by 2033.
Strengthening Strategic Partnerships with the U.S. and France
U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement (2008)
aimed to promote nuclear energy collaboration but has remained
largely unfulfilled
France’s EDF has also faced
years of delays
in executing its Jaitapur project.
With Modi’s visit to
Washington and Paris
, India seeks to
finalize deals and remove roadblocks for nuclear investments
The Challenges of Amending CLNDA:
Domestic Political Opposition
The original
2010 CLNDA
was passed after
strong public and parliamentary debates
, emphasizing that foreign companies should not be
exempt from liability in case of nuclear accidents
Any amendments that
weaken supplier liability
may face
resistance from opposition parties
and civil society groups.
Legal and Regulatory Uncertainty
While experts support aligning CLNDA with
global nuclear liability standards
, there is concern over
how the amendments will be structured
Ministry of External Affairs has declined to provide details
on what the proposed changes will entail.
Investor Confidence and Insurance Issues
To ease concerns, India created a
₹1,500 crore insurance pool (2019)
to help cover nuclear damages, but this
failed to attract major investors
The amendments must ensure that both
international companies and Indian operators
feel confident in
legal protections and compensation frameworks
Potential Global and Economic Impact:
Unlocking Stalled Nuclear Projects
If CLNDA is amended, projects like
Westinghouse’s AP1000 reactors in Andhra Pradesh
EDF’s Jaitapur plant
could finally proceed, significantly boosting India’s
clean energy capacity
Strengthening India’s Role in Global Nuclear Energy
India's push for
aligns with international trends, where countries are investing in
modular, cost-effective nuclear technologies
. Partnering with the
on nuclear energy will:
Enhance India's technological expertise
Diversify its energy mix
Reduce dependency on fossil fuels
U.S. and France’s Strategic Interest in India
U.S. wants to increase energy exports
, including nuclear technology, as part of its
trade and strategic policies
France, a global leader in nuclear power
, sees India as a
key market
for its advanced reactor technology.
As a result, both countries are
keen on resolving nuclear liability concerns
to deepen
economic and diplomatic ties with India
Conclusion:
The proposed
amendments to India’s nuclear liability law
represent a crucial shift in policy, aimed at attracting
foreign investment
unlocking long-pending nuclear energy projects
While this move could significantly
expand India’s nuclear capacity
, it must balance
international obligations with domestic political considerations
As Prime Minister Modi
heads to the U.S. and France
, all eyes will be on whether these amendments can
finally break the 15-year deadlock
and position India as a
major player in global nuclear energy

**********Budget Allocation for Urban Development - Key Highlights and Insights
Why in news?
In 2015, the then government prioritized urban development, recognizing cities' 67% contribution to GDP.
However, in its "Viksit Bharat" vision, urban development appears to be overlooked.
What’s in today’s article?
Budget Allocation for Urban India
Declining Urban Transfers: Analysing Budget Cuts and Their Impact
Way Forward for Urban Development
Total Outlay -
₹96,777 crore, up from last year’s ₹82,576.57 crore. However, adjusting for inflation, the real allocation has declined.
Underutilisation of Funds -
Revised Estimates indicate only ₹63,669.93 crore will be spent by March, reflecting a 22.9% shortfall.
Cuts in
PMAY(U)
Allocation for FY 2024-25 was ₹30,170.61 crore, but Revised Estimates slashed it to ₹13,670 crore.
Policy vs. Implementation Gap -
Despite increased outlay, funds are misaligned with urban infrastructure needs, prioritizing capital-intensive projects over employment and sustainable development.
Transfers to urban India primarily occur through three channels — direct transfers to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs); Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS); and Central Sector Schemes.
There has been a reduction in direct transfers to ULBs.
Key Factors behind Reduction in Urban Transfers
Decline in Direct Transfers to ULBs
ULBs' share reduced from ₹26,653 crore to ₹26,158 crore.
Revenue loss due to GST (21% decline) not compensated adequately.
Cities may need to impose additional taxes on citizens.
Cuts in Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)
PMAY(U) (CSS component):
30% budget cut compared to last year.
AMRUT
& Smart Cities Mission:
Decreased allocations, with nearly no funds left for Smart Cities.
Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban)
Retains ₹5,000 crore allocation, but only ₹2,159 crore (56% less) is expected to be spent.
Shift in Focus to Capital-Intensive Metro Projects
Metro and Mass Rapid Transit Systems see increased funding.
FY 2024-25 Budget: ₹21,335.98 crore → RE: ₹24,691.47 crore.
FY 2025-26 Proposal: ₹31,239.28 crore (46% rise).
Prioritizing metro projects over broader urban mobility raises concerns about inclusivity.
Introduction of the Urban Challenge Fund
A new ₹10,000 crore fund announced for urban redevelopment.
Target set at ₹1 lakh crore, with 50% expected from private investments.
Reliance on private funding seems unrealistic, given past low participation in the
Shift Towards Capital-Intensive Projects
Budget prioritizes large infrastructure over employment and sustainability.
Limited focus on green jobs and inclusive economic growth.
Risk of widening social and economic disparities in urban areas.

**********Private Property and the State’s Right to Acquire According to Law
Why in News?
Amid President Donald Trump’s accusing South Africa of confiscating private land, the article discusses the evolution of laws governing land acquisition and property rights in different countries, including
South Africa, the US, and India
.
It highlights the
balance between private property rights and the state's power of eminent domain.
Eminent Domain and Historical Background:
The concept of eminent domain
refers to the authority of the state to acquire private land for public use, with or without compensation.
The term traces back to Hugo Grotius in 1625
, who described the idea that a sovereign can take private property for public necessity.
The principle traveled to
European colonies
influenced laws
such as:
Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (India)
Expropriation Act, 1975 (South Africa)
Global Perspective on Property Rights:
United Kingdom:
Magna Carta (1215)
was the first instance where limits were placed on the King’s power to arbitrarily take property.
It required that land could only be taken “by the law of the land.”
United States:
The Fifth Amendment (1791)
states that private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation.
In Kelo v. City of New London (2005), the US Supreme Court ruled that property acquisition to facilitate private economic development could be justified under “
Some US states, like Alabama, Delaware, and Texas, later
restricted the use of eminent domain
South Africa:
Article 25 of the Constitution states that no one can be deprived of property arbitrarily, but expropriation is allowed for a public purpose with just compensation.
India:
The Constitution
initially
recognized the right to property as
a fundamental right under Article 19.
In addition,
Article 31
ensures that the property could not be taken into possession or acquired for public purpose unless the law provides for the compensation of such properties.
However, the
44th Constitutional Amendment (1978)
removed it from the list of fundamental rights.
It is now
a legal right under Article 300A
, which ensures that property cannot be taken without legal authority.
Land Acquisition in India:
Pre-2013 framework:
Governed by the
Allowed the government to acquire land for a “public purpose” with compensation.
Did not consider the impact on affected families beyond the landowner.
Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Act, 2013:
It came into force to ensure:
Humane, participatory, and transparent land acquisition.
Social Impact Assessment (SIA) to evaluate the impact on affected communities.
Compensation, rehabilitation, and resettlement measures.
Conclusion:
Balancing public interest with private property rights is crucial.
Different countries have evolved laws to regulate land acquisition, ensuring compensation and legal safeguards.
In India
, post-2013 reforms aimed at making the land acquisition process more just and transparent.

This
summit follows earlier AI safety discussions in the United Kingdom (2023) and South Korea (2024),
expanding the discourse beyond risk management to include innovation, AI governance, and the future of work.
For India, this event presents a crucial opportunity to further the interests of the Global South
in the evolving AI landscape while positioning itself as a leader in international AI policy discussions.
India’s Growing Influence in AI Governance
India has been an active participant in global AI discussions.
country played a key role in the Bletchley Park meeting, which focused on frontier AI models and safety concerns,
and in the Seoul summit, which emphasised multilateral collaboration on AI risk management.
India’s establishment of its own AI Safety Institute
aligns with these global efforts,
demonstrating its commitment to AI safety and governance.
Beyond safety,
India has been a strong advocate for the Global South,
emphasising equitable access to AI infrastructure.
Under its presidency of the G20 in 2023, India promoted a ‘pro-innovation regulatory/governance approach’
that sought to balance innovation with necessary safeguards.
Similarly,

To facilitate this,
India should propose the creation of an AI use-case repository, which would help guide Global South nations
in leveraging AI effectively.
Contextualising AI Risks and Safety Measures
AI risks vary significantly between developed and developing nations.
Many risk assessments and safety measures focus on the concerns of the Global North,
overlooking challenges faced by the Global South.
India should highlight unique risks,
such as cultural erosion caused by AI models predominantly trained on Western datasets.
Additionally,
India should advocate for a data-driven approach to AI risk mitigation,
including:
Collecting evidence of AI-related harms specific to the Global South.
Developing regulatory frameworks based on real-world AI impact assessments.
Creating a repository of AI-related harms to inform future policymaking.
By doing so,
India can help ensure that AI governance frameworks are inclusive and responsive to diverse global challenges.
India’s Potential Role as a Future AI Summit Host
As a co-chair of the Paris Summit,
India has a strategic opportunity to solidify its leadership in AI governance.
By championing the Global South’s interests,
India can position itself as a frontrunner to host the next AI Action Summit.
This would allow it to further influence global AI policymaking,
bridging the gap between AI superpowers and developing nations.
Conclusion
India’s participation in the Paris AI Action Summit is a pivotal moment
for both the nation and the Global South.
By advocating for democratised AI access, region-specific AI applications, and contextualised AI risk assessments,
India can ensure that AI benefits are shared equitably across the world.
securing a leadership role in future AI summits would reinforce India’s position as a key player

**********[10th February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Keeping a watch on the growing arc of violence
International Relations
PYQ Relevance:
Q. The scourge of terrorism is a grave challenge to national security. What solutions do you suggest to curb this growing menace? What are the major sources of terrorist funding?
(2017)
Q. Discuss the impediments India is facing in its pursuit of a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.
(2015)
Mentor’s Comment:
Wars are raging, global institutions are failing, and terrorism is evolving in new, digital, and decentralized forms. While conflicts like the Ukraine war and Gaza crisis dominate headlines, subterranean threats such as radicalization and lone-wolf terrorism are quietly reshaping global security risks.
Today’s editorial highlights why the world is in a volatile state, how extremist groups are adapting, and why counterterrorism efforts must evolve to meet these new challenges.
Why in the News?
The world is going through an unpredictable phase, with
wars, conflicts, and terrorism on the rise
post-1945 global order
has collapsed, and international institutions like the
United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
and the
International Court of Justice (ICJ)
are failing to prevent violence. At the same time, terrorism is evolving, using
digital tools and decentralized networks
to survive and grow.
Why is the Present Period Unpredictable?
Wars in Europe and West Asia:
Ukraine war continues
with no clear end in sight.
Gaza conflict and tensions in Lebanon
have led to
large-scale civilian casualties
Failure of Global Institutions:
UNSC and ICJ
have become
powerless observers
, unable to stop wars.
principles of international law
are now ignored by major powers.
Moral and Political Decline:
Nations are acting in
self-interest
no common moral framework
Peace efforts
are temporary and
do not address the root causes
of conflicts.
What are the Recent Subterranean Activities?
False Sense of Stability in West Asia:
Some believe that
Israeli military actions
have weakened
Iran’s regional influence
However,
underground resistance movements
are growing, keeping tensions high.
Resurgence of Islamist Extremism:
Jihadist groups are reorganizing
, using online radicalization.
“Lone wolf” attacks
are increasing, making them harder to predict.
Digital Radicalization:
Terrorist groups are
recruiting and training people online
Social media and encrypted messaging apps
are used to
spread extremist ideologies
How Terrorism is Witnessing a Revival?
Terrorism is Adapting:
Since
1979
, terrorist networks have evolved.
Al-Qaeda and ISIS
have used
both military and digital strategies
to stay active.
Now, terrorism is shifting towards smaller, more frequent attacks.
Al-Qaeda and ISIS Regrouping:
Al-Qaeda is training militants in Afghanistan
, under Taliban rule.
ISIS-Khorasan (ISKP) is expanding
its operations beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Attacks have been reported in
Moscow, Türkiye, and Iran
More Small-Scale Attacks:
Instead of large bombings, modern terrorism relies on:
Lone-wolf attacks
(one person acting alone).
Vehicle attacks, knives, or simple explosives
AI-driven propaganda
to recruit supporters.
Recent Terror Attacks in the U.S.:
Las Vegas Cyber Truck Explosion
: A Tesla
exploded outside a hotel
where
President-elect Donald Trump was staying
New Orleans Vehicle Attack
: A former soldier
drove a truck into a crowd
, killing 14 people while displaying an
ISIS flag
Virginia Terror Plot
: Authorities
foiled a planned attack
in early 2025.
Warnings for the Future:
Experts warn of a new wave of terror attacks using digital tools.
Security agencies worldwide are on high alert to prevent further incidents.
Conclusion
A technology-driven and cooperative global approach is essential to counter rising conflicts and terrorism. Nations must strengthen international institutions, use AI for surveillance, and enforce stricter digital regulations to prevent online radicalization. Community engagement and de-radicalization programs can help address extremism at its roots. Stronger border security, cyber-tracking, and intelligence-sharing will be key to preventing future attacks. As threats become more decentralized and digital, proactive measures and global collaboration are the only paths to lasting peace.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Illegal Immigration;
Why in the News?
A U.S. Air Force C-17 plane landed at Amritsar’s Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport on February 5, 2025, carrying around 100 Indian nationals. These individuals were suspected of trying to enter the U.S. illegally.
What are the Hotspots states of Illegal Immigration in India?
Gujarat:
North Gujarat, including the districts of Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Patan, and Banaskantha, is a major hotspot. Specific illegal immigration hotspots within these districts include Dingucha, Khalva, Nardipur, and Limdivas in Kalol taluka of Gandhinagar district; Vijapur, Andudar, Tundali, Bhadol, and Dhanali in Mehsana district; and Sola Science City Road and Bhadaj in Ahmedabad city.
Punjab:
Punjab is also a significant hotspot for illegal immigration.
Haryana:
Haryana is another state identified as a hotspot.
Andhra Pradesh tops the list of agents engaged in illegal manpower migration overseas. As of Oct 30, 2023, a total of 2925 such agents have been identified.
What are the most common methods used?
Forged Documents:
Agents create fake passports, visas, and other documents to facilitate illegal migration. This includes fake departure/arrival stamps, work permits, and educational or corporate papers.
“Donkey Routes”:
Agents organize travel through multiple countries to exploit visa loopholes and enable illegal border crossings into the desired destination. This often involves routing individuals through countries with visa-on-arrival options for Indian nationals.
Exploiting Loopholes:
Agents exploit student visas and family immigration categories, as well as sham marriages and adoptions, to facilitate illegal immigration.
What are the Reasons for Illegal Migration?
Economic Factors:
Poverty, lack of economic opportunities, and the desire for a better standard of living push individuals to seek opportunities in other countries. The promise of opportunities, like the “American Dream,” attracts migrants.
Political and Religious Persecution:

**********How has the Budget allocated funds for urban development?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Infrastructure related to urban;
Why in the News?
The 2025 Budget has set up a ₹1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund to help cities grow and develop.
What was the allocation for urban India?
Increased Allocation but Underutilization
: The Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry received ₹96,777 crore for FY 2025-26, a 17% increase from the previous year. However, the Revised Estimate for 2024-25 stood at ₹63,669.93 crore, indicating significant underutilization of funds.
Urban Challenge Fund and PMAY Focus
: A
Urban Challenge Fund has been proposed for city redevelopment and water & sanitation projects, with
₹10,000 crore
allocated for FY 2025-26. Additionally,
₹78,126 crore
has been allocated to both rural and urban
for housing development.
Support for Urban Workers and Street Vendors
: The government aims to uplift urban workers through
PM SVANidhi
, which has benefited
68 lakh street vendors
. The scheme will be revamped with
enhanced bank loans, UPI-linked credit cards (₹30,000 limit), and capacity-building support
to reduce reliance on informal sector loans.
How has the reduction happened?
Decline in Direct Transfers to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)
: With the abolition of
octroi
and the implementation of
GST
, ULBs lost a key revenue source, expecting compensation through central devolution. However, the central share for ULBs
declined from ₹26,653 crore (last year) to ₹26,158 crore
in 2025-26, increasing financial pressure on local bodies.
Cuts in Key Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)
PMAY (Urban)
faced a
drastic cut
, with its allocation reduced from ₹30,170.61 crore to
₹13,670 crore
in the Revised Estimate (RE) for 2024-25.
AMRUT and Smart Cities Mission
allocations fell below ₹10,400 crore, with almost no new funds for the
Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban)
retained ₹5,000 crore, but
RE shows only ₹2,159 crore was spent
—a
56% underutilization
Shift in Priorities Toward Capital-Intensive Metro Projects
: While many urban development schemes saw cuts, metro rail projects received
increased funding
Metro projects’ allocation rose
from ₹21,335.98 crore to ₹24,691.47 crore in RE (2024-25)
and is further proposed to
increase by 46%
to ₹31,239.28 crore in 2025-26.
This shift prioritizes large infrastructure over
comprehensive urban mobility, employment generation, and local governance funding
Does the Union Budget focus on capital-intensive projects?
Priority to Large Infrastructure Projects:
The budget significantly increases funding for metro rail projects (
₹31,239.28 crore, up 46%
), while allocations for urban schemes like
PMAY (Urban), AMRUT, and Smart Cities Mission have been reduced or underutilized
Reliance on Private Investment for Urban Development:
requires
50% private sector participation
, which may slow implementation, shifting focus from government-driven urban welfare programs to capital-intensive projects.
What next?
Urban Challenge Fund Implementation Risks
: The government has introduced a
50% of the funding is expected from private investments
Given the
limited private sector participation
in past urban initiatives like the
, relying on private funding could slow implementation.
Balancing Infrastructure with Livability and Sustainability
budget favors metro expansion
but lacks a broader focus on
sustainable urban planning
Future policies must integrate
green jobs, affordable housing, and local governance empowerment
to create more inclusive cities.
Strengthening Financial Autonomy for Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)
decline in direct transfers
devolution post-GST
has weakened ULB finances, forcing cities to
raise taxes or cut essential services
Strengthening municipal revenue sources,
revising property tax frameworks
, and ensuring
timely fund disbursal
can help cities plan better for growth.
Conclusion:
Need to Strengthen municipal revenue sources through
property tax reforms, land monetization, and timely fund transfers
, reducing dependency on central allocations. The government should ensure
equitable investment
in metro expansion, affordable housing, sanitation, and employment generation, fostering
livable, sustainable, and inclusive urban growth

Why in the News?
The
US Department of Agriculture
has confirmed a
new spillover of H5N1 avian flu genotype D1.1
into
dairy cattle
in the United States.
What is Genotype D1.1?
Genotype D1.1 is a strain of the
H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
virus, primarily found in
poultry and wild birds
It is part of the
H5 clade 2.3.4.4b
, which has been responsible for multiple outbreaks worldwide.
It was recently confirmed in
dairy herds in Churchill County, Nevada, USA
Symptoms in Cattle
: Includes
fever, reduced milk production, coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge
Differences from B3.13
: Genotype B3.13, the previous dominant H5N1 strain in cattle, caused
milder infections in humans
, whereas
D1.1 has led to more severe cases
Bird Flu (Avian Influenza) Spillover of H5N1 Virus
spillover event
occurs when a virus jumps from its natural host species (wild birds) to other animals or humans.
It spreads through
wild bird migration routes
, carrying the virus across continents.
The virus has been detected in
unpasteurized milk
from infected cows, raising concerns about
worker exposure
Impacts on India
Although
genotype D1.1 has not been detected in India
, the growing spread of
H5N1 in cattle and humans abroad
raises concerns for
public health and livestock industries
in India.
India is part of
major bird migration routes (Central Asian Flyway & East Asian-Australasian Flyway)
, making it vulnerable to H5N1 spread from infected wild birds.
With India being the
world’s largest milk producer
, a spillover of H5N1 into dairy cattle could
severely impact milk production and exports
While human cases remain rare, a mutation allowing
human-to-human transmission
could lead to
a pandemic-like scenario
poultry products
to Middle Eastern and Asian markets; an H5N1 outbreak could lead to bans and economic losses.
