**********Combat Air Teaming System (CATS) Programme
Recently, the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) achieved a significant milestone in its flagship Combat Air Teaming System (CATS) programme with the successful completion of the engine ground run of a full-scale demonstrator, CATS-Warrior loyal wingman.
About Combat Air Teaming System (CATS) Programme:
It represents a leap in
unmanned and manned combat aircraft systems
The primary goal is to
create advanced aerial platforms
that can serve as
atmospheric satellites for high-altitude surveillance
and conduct autonomous deep-penetration precision strikes from standoff distances, all while minimising risk to life.
The programme’s long-term goals include
deep-strike precision, improved battlefield awareness
, and secure communications for enhanced operational efficiency.
To achieve these capabilities, HAL’s CATS programme comprises
multiple platforms, each tailored for specific roles in combat operations:
CATS-Warrior:
A stealth UCAV designed to accompany manned fighter jets on missions as a loyal wingman platform. It can carry
Smart Anti-Airfield Weapons (SAAWs)
and Next-Generation Close Combat Missiles (NG-CCMs) in internal weapon bays to enhance its strike and self-defence capabilities. These drones reportedly possess stealth features, making them difficult for enemy radars and air defence systems to detect. The Warrior drone can execute strikes after penetrating nearly 700 km into enemy territory.
CATS-Hunter:
Likely to be an
air-launched low-observable cruise missile
capable of precision strikes deep inside enemy territory. HAL has reportedly indicated that this system will play a role similar to the SCALP missile integrated with the IAF's Rafale jets.
ALFA-S Swarm Drones:
Released from a
carrier pod mounted on the mothership
, these swarm drones can perform air-to-ground and air-to-air missions, including neutralising enemy air defence systems. A Tejas aircraft can potentially carry three pods (12 drones), while a Su-30MKI can carry up to four pods (16 drones).
CATS-Infinity Pseudo Satellite:
The Infinity is an
ultra-high-altitude, solar-powered pseudo satellite
designed to operate at an altitude of approximately 70,000 feet. With an endurance of 90 days, it bridges the surveillance gap between satellites and UAVs. Equipped with advanced sensors and synthetic aperture radar, its primary role within the HAL CATS programme is to track targets in enemy territory and coordinate missions involving the CATS Warrior. The pseudo satellite can
also support 4G and 5G services
, strengthening military communication systems.
The system envisages the
Tejas Light Combat Aircraft
(LCA) as the "mothership" controlling a network of autonomous platforms, including the CATS-Warrior, which is a low-observable unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV).

**********Transforming ‘Men’-Talities, Redefining Masculinity
Context
The
International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women
(November 25) serves as
a sombre reminder of the persistent global issue
of gender-based violence.
Despite decades of advocacy
, nearly one in three women worldwide has suffered violence at the hands of men.
This
alarming statistic highlights the need to engage men not just as perpetrators but also as key agents of change
in combating violence against women.
The Root Causes of Violence Against Women and Progress in Engaging Men
Early Socialisation and Harmful Expectations
In many societies,
boys are raised with messages that equate masculinity with authority and control.
Common
phrases such as ‘boys don’t cry’ and ‘man up’ suppress emotional expression
, forcing boys to internalise their feelings.
emotional suppression often manifests as frustration, aggression, or a lack of emotional intelligence,
which can harm their relationships and mental health.
Boys are also taught to associate strength with dominance
, leading to a perception that they must assert control over others, often women, to affirm their masculinity.
These
societal messages are reinforced by gendered expectations
in families.
For example,
boys may observe that household decision-making and outdoor activities are reserved for men,
while caregiving and domestic chores are deemed women’s responsibilities.
Toxic Masculinity
Toxic masculinity
, a term used to describe harmful behaviours and attitudes
associated with traditional male roles, further compounds the problem.
It
emphasises aggression, competition, and dominance
, which are often expressed in harmful ways.
Men conditioned by these norms may resort to violence to assert control
or resolve conflicts, especially in situations where their authority feels challenged.
This is
a critical factor in domestic violence
and other forms of gender-based violence.
Toxic masculinity also affects men themselves
, trapping them in cycles of emotional isolation and destructive behaviour.
inability to express vulnerability can lead to poor mental health outcomes
, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.
The Role of Media and Cultural Narratives
Films, advertisements, and popular culture frequently portray men as aggressive protectors
or stoic providers, while women are depicted as passive caregivers or victims.
Such representations
reinforce binary gender roles
and discourage deviation from these norms.
Boys who consume these narratives often aspire to embody these stereotypical ideals,
further entrenching toxic masculinity.
In some cultures, religious or traditional beliefs may also reinforce harmful gender norms.
In recent years,
the development sector has increasingly focused on the role of men and masculinities in achieving gender equality.
Academic research and grassroots efforts have highlighted effective strategies
for engaging men in challenging traditional gender norms.
These initiatives reveal a growing willingness among men to contribute to gender equality
, not as passive allies but as active participants in social transformation.
Case Study: India’s Approach to Gender Equality
UNESCO’s Transforming MENtalities Initiative
UNESCO’s Transforming MENtalities initiative
stands out as a comprehensive effort to address the root causes of gender inequality
by engaging men and boys.
Rather than treating them solely as allies in the fight for gender equality,
this initiative positions them as active participants in social transformation.
By dismantling rigid and harmful ideas of masculinity, it encourages men to adopt positive,
supportive roles within their families and communities.
As part of this initiative,
UNESCO partnered with the International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW) to produce the report Engaging Men and Boys: A Report on Pathways to Gender Equality in India.
report documents pioneering programs that have successfully engaged men and boys in addressing gender biases
, fostering equitable attitudes, and creating sustainable change.
Pioneering Programs and their Impact
Mardon Wali Baat (A Man’s Thing)
Run by The YP Foundation
, this
initiative uses storytelling and social media to engage young men
on college campuses and in communities.
encourages participants to critically examine societal narratives
around masculinity, such as equating strength with dominance, and to embrace values of respect, equality, and emotional openness.
By creating conversations on positive masculinities, this program equips young men to challenge stereotypes
in their personal lives and communities.
Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS)
collaboration between ICRW and the Rajasthan Department of Education, GEMS works with adolescents
to address toxic masculinity through interactive classroom activities.
By focusing on critical discussions, t
he program helps boys understand the harm caused by traditional gender roles
and encourages them to adopt equitable attitudes.
One transformative moment occurred when a boy reflected
, “I used to think boys should only do outdoor chores. Now, I believe we should work alongside women at home.”
These insights have a ripple effect, influencing not only the boys themselves but also their families and peers.
Dekh Rekh (Caring for Each Other) and Hamari Shaadi (Our Marriage)
These programs
focus on engaging men in household and familial responsibilities
, such as family planning and nutrition.
By encouraging men to take active roles in domestic spheres traditionally dominated by women,
these initiatives challenge deeply rooted gender biases and promote equality through everyday actions.
The Way Forward
Reshaping Norms to Address Root Causes
Early education is essential
to dismantling stereotypes, teaching boys that vulnerability, empathy, and equality are strengths, not weaknesses.
Families, schools, and communities must model and promote alternative
, healthier definitions of masculinity.
Public campaigns, media representations, and positive role models can further reinforce these messages
by showing that masculinity can coexist with emotional openness, partnership, and respect for women.
Community-Driven Approaches
The success
of these programs
lies in their community-driven approach.
By integrating local contexts and cultural nuances,
these initiatives resonate with participants and develop r grassroots ownership of gender equality efforts.
interactive sessions, storytelling, and role-playing activities are used to make complex ideas accessible and relatable.
Moreover, engaging men and boys within their own social environments ensures that change is not imposed from the outside but emerges organically, making it more sustainable.
Conclusion
As we move forward
, let us celebrate the men and boys who are challenging traditional masculinities and championing equality.
By redefining what it means to ‘be a man,’ we can create a world where everyone, regardless of gender, is free from violence
and empowered to thrive.
Together, through education, advocacy, and collective action
, the violence against women can be eliminated and we can build a more just and equitable society.

Editorial Analysis
**********How demand in temples distresses elephants, fuels wild captures
Why in news?
Recently, a disturbed male elephant injured 24 people during a mosque feast in Malappuram, Kerala. The incident has revived debates on animal welfare and public safety, especially following recent legal disputes over using elephants in ceremonies.
Kerala reported 24 captive elephant deaths in 2024 and 154 since 2019, while domestic elephants killed 196 people at festivals between 2011 and 2023.
Last month, the Supreme Court invoked volenti non fit injuria (voluntary assumption of risk) to state that devotees accept the risks of attending festivals with paraded elephants.
What’s in today’s article?
Stand of Court on this issue
Agony suffered by the elephants used in in religious ceremonies
Continued Supply from the Wild
Way forward
Kerala High Court's Suo Moto Intervention
In November 2024, the Kerala High Court mandated safety measures for festivals involving elephants, including:
3 meters
between two elephants
5 meters
between an elephant and flaming torches
8 meters
between an elephant and the public or percussion displays
100 meters
between elephants and fireworks
These measures effectively limited the number of elephants paraded, based on available space.
Impact on Thrissur Pooram
The restrictions affected Kerala's largest religious festival, Thrissur Pooram, started in the late 18th century by Sakthan Thampuran, Maharaja of Kochi.
Festival organizers argued that maintaining a 3-meter distance was impractical and approached the Supreme Court (SC).
Supreme Court's Decision
The SC stayed the Kerala HC order, emphasizing that courts should not engage in law-making.
The apex court reverted to the safety norms under the
Kerala Captive Elephants (Management and Maintenance) Rules, 2012
, which are often violated.
Animal rights activists have highlighted frequent breaches of the 2012 rules.
They cite examples like the January 5 incident where
five elephants were paraded within the confined compound of Thrissur’s Thiruvambady temple
Elephants Have No Choice
Unlike devotees who voluntarily attend festivals, elephants are forced into these events without consent.
The elephant involved in the recent tragedy, had a history of stress-induced aggression, including injuring its keeper in January 2024.
Despite this, the animal was reemployed after a brief break.
Stress and Health Impacts on Captive Elephants
A 2019 study by the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) revealed that prolonged participation in religious ceremonies puts elephants under severe stress
Key findings include:
Elevated stress hormones
(glucocorticoid metabolites) were detected in elephants subjected to chaining and long working hours.
Stress led to hyperglycemia
, suppressed immune responses, delayed wound healing, and even neuronal cell death.
Captive elephants at zoos or forest camps had significantly lower stress levels than those at festivals.
Visible Signs of Distress
Captive elephants display clear signs of extreme stress, such as:
Head bobbing, weaving, and swaying, which indicate monotony and mental distress.
Physical strain from repetitive actions like kneeling or trunk lifting.
Overexertion and lack of exercise due to prolonged standing at one spot.
Noise and light exposure further exacerbate their suffering during festivals.
Legal Restrictions on Capturing Wild Elephants
The Madras High Court, in September 2021, reaffirmed the
1977 ban on capturing wild elephants, except for treatment of animals unable to survive in the wild
Trading captive elephants was banned in 1986, but gifting legally possessed captive elephants to capable caretakers remained permitted, creating loopholes.
Despite bans, wild elephants continue to meet demand in temples, particularly in southern states. Key factors include:
Ineffective Breeding in Captivity
: Breeding is challenging due to the aggressive behavior of males in musth and unproductive forest mating strategies for captive females.
Illegal Practices
: Wild-caught elephants are misrepresented as captive-bred by removing microchips meant for domestic elephants and implanting them in wild ones.
Exploiting Human-Wildlife Conflict
Man-elephant conflicts provide further opportunities for capturing wild elephants.
Politicians have proposed capturing so-called "problem elephants" and sending them to temples, which appeases both villagers and temple trusts, perpetuating the cycle of captivity.
Amendment to the Wildlife Act (2022)
The 2022 amendment to the Wildlife Act introduced a proviso allowing the central government to frame rules for the transfer of elephants for “religious and other” purposes.
This change risked undoing the conservation gains made since the Act’s inception in 1972.
Steps Toward Regulation: DNA Mapping
To curb the misuse of microchips in identifying captive elephants, the Centre launched a DNA profiling initiative in August 2022.
First Phase Results
: Within six months, 270 captive elephants were genotyped.
Objective
: Detect captive bloodlines and ensure better regulation of elephant ownership and transfer.
Cultural Context and Finding Balance
Elephants are deeply tied to Kerala’s cultural traditions, making their removal from festivals unlikely.
Experts emphasize finding a middle ground, suggesting:
Leveraging Kerala’s cultural association with elephants to ensure their welfare.
Using recent Kerala High Court directions to enhance safety measures during festivals.
Activists argue that courts should guide practices rather than legislate, enabling safer elephant participation while respecting traditions.

**********Progress, Challenges and the Path to Self-Reliance of India's Urea Industry
Why in News?
Amid challenges in the fertilizer sector, such as shortages in di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and limited investments in manufacturing, India's urea industry has achieved significant progress.
Domestic production has risen considerably, reflecting efforts toward the central government's goal of atma nirbharta (self-reliance).
What’s in Today’s Article?
Overview of Fertiliser Sector in India
What is Urea Fertilizer?
Rising Domestic Urea Production
Greenfield Projects and Efficiency
Make vs. Buy Debate
Strategic Shift and Policy Recommendations
Conclusion
Overview of Fertiliser Sector in India:
The Economic Survey 2023-24
states that the Indian Agriculture sector provides livelihood support to about
42
3%
of the population and has a share of
18.2%
in the country’s GDP at current prices.
Fertilizers, water and seeds are vital inputs
for achieving higher agricultural production in the country.
Government has undertaken various efforts
during the last decade due to which the total fertilizer production has increased from 385.39 million tonnes (mt) in 2014-15 to 503.35 mt in 2023-24.
Several measures
were undertaken by the Government to increase the total fertilizer production in the country.
Urea Subsidy Scheme,
New Urea Policy 2015,
Nutrient based Subsidy scheme, etc.
Besides, it also promotes sustainable methods such as the use of alternative fertilizers viz.,
Nano Urea, Nano DAP and organic fertilizer
It is a nitrogen-rich fertilizer
(46% nitrogen) used to promote crop growth and development.
It's a low-cost fertilizer.
Its high nitrogen content makes transportation and storage less expensive.
Urea is absorbed
by plants directly or converted to ammonia and carbon dioxide by soil microorganisms.
It can also be used as a
cattle feed supplement,
and has industrial applications, such as in the
production of plastics.
Rising Domestic Urea Production:
Growth trends:
Between 2011-12 and 2023-24, domestic urea production rose from 22 million tonnes (mt) to 31.4 mt, while imports decreased from 7.8 mt to 7 mt.
Import reduction:
The current fiscal recorded a 31.7% drop in imports, potentially reducing imports to below 5 mt, the lowest since 2006-07.
Greenfield Projects and Efficiency:
New plants:
Six new urea plants contributed significantly to increased production, with a combined output of 7.55 mt in 2023-24.
Investments ranged from Rs 6,000-8,600 crore per plant.
Plants include those by HURL, Chambal Fertilisers, Matix Fertilisers, and RFCL.
Energy efficiency:
New plants consume about 5 giga-calories (GCal) per tonne, compared to 5.5-6.5 GCal for older units.
The Matix Fertiliser plant in Panagarh (West Bengal) emerged as the most energy-efficient, with 4.856 GCal/tonne consumption.
Regional focus:
These plants cater to “
new Green Revolution
” areas like
Eastern UP, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Telangana
, providing a 20% market share in Eastern India.
Older units such as the National Fertilizers Ltd’s (NFL) Bathinda, Nangal and Panipat, caters to farmers in Punjab and Haryana.
Upcoming projects:
(Talcher Fertilizer Plant)
Located in
Odisha
, this Rs 17,080 crore plant will use coal as a feedstock with advanced coal gasification technology.
Coal blending with petroleum coke aims to maximize indigenous resources.
Make vs. Buy Debate:
Cost comparison:
Domestic production costs:
$427-$493 per tonne, depending on tax adjustments.
Imported urea costs:
$370-403 per tonne.
Logistics advantage:
Transport and bagging costs make imported urea less viable for northern and eastern regions.
Domestic plants reduce logistical expenses and provide employment and economic activity under the
Make-in-India initiative.
Strategic Shift and Policy Recommendations:
Regional production strategy:
Focus on increasing production in
Northern and Eastern India
while optimizing imports for Peninsular India.
Shut down older, inefficient plants to enhance energy efficiency.
Rational pricing:
Urea’s farmgate price has been fixed at Rs 5,360/tonne since 2012, leading to excessive consumption.
Rational pricing is crucial for balanced fertilizer use and reducing dependency on both production and imports.
Conclusion:
India’s urea industry has made significant strides toward self-reliance with new energy-efficient plants and strategic investments.
However, achieving a sustainable balance between domestic production and imports requires policy interventions in pricing, regional production focus, and the judicious application of fertilizers.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to the Judiciary;
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court fined Rs. 1 Lakh on a dishonest person who kept filing unnecessary and baseless cases. The Court said that while everyone has the right to go to court, it should be used responsibly.
What is meant by ‘Right to Access to Justice’?
The Right to Access to Justice refers to the fundamental principle that individuals should have the ability to seek and obtain remedies through formal or informal institutions of justice for grievances.
This right is rooted in the rule of law and ensures that all citizens, regardless of their background, can effectively resolve their legal issues and hold decision-makers accountable.
Without access to justice, individuals may be unable to exercise their rights, challenge discrimination, or seek redress for wrongs they have suffered.
What are the other provisions related to the Right to Access to Justice?
Article 14 (Equality before the law)
: This article guarantees that everyone is treated equally under the law, regardless of their background or status.
A notable example is the
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India
case (1978), where the Supreme Court held that the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 also includes the right to fair procedure.
Article 21 (Right to life and personal liberty)
: This article protects the fundamental right to life, which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include the right to a fair and just legal process.
In the
State of Maharashtra v. Chandrabhan
(1983) case, the Supreme Court ruled that access to justice is a key aspect of the right to life under Article 21, emphasizing the importance of protecting personal liberty.
Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987
: This Act ensures free legal aid for the poor and disadvantaged, promoting equality in accessing justice.
A significant example is the
National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India
(2014) case, where the Supreme Court directed the implementation of effective legal aid programs for the marginalized, making access to justice easier for underprivileged groups.
Article 39A (Free legal aid)
: This article mandates the state to provide free legal assistance to ensure that no one is denied justice due to financial incapacity.
An example is the
Laxmi v. Union of India
(2014) case, where the Supreme Court directed the government to ensure legal aid is available for victims of acid attacks, recognizing that financial constraints should not prevent victims from seeking justice.
Judicial Precedents (Supreme Court Decisions)
: The Supreme Court has consistently expanded the concept of access to justice. In
Delhi Domestic Workers Forum v. Union of India
(2016), the Court recognized the need for legal protection for domestic workers, expanding access to justice for marginalized groups.
National Legal Services Authority (NALSA)
: NALSA has played a crucial role in ensuring legal aid for marginalized communities.
For instance, in the
NALSA v. Union of India
(2014) case, the Court ordered the government to set up legal aid camps and ensure access to justice for tribals and marginalized groups, further solidifying NALSA’s role in promoting equality and fairness in the legal system.
What are the essential elements for the Right to Access to Justice?
Availability of Legal Remedies:
Individuals must have access to effective legal remedies that can address their grievances.
Affordability:
Legal services should be financially accessible, with provisions for free legal aid where necessary.
Awareness and Information:
Citizens should be informed about their rights and the legal processes available to them.
Fair Procedures:
The judicial process must be transparent and fair, providing all parties an equal opportunity to present their case.
