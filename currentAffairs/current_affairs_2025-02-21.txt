Solar Coronal Holes
Recently, a new study has accurately estimated the physical parameters of thermal and magnetic field structures of solar coronal holes.
About Solar Coronal Holes:
Coronal holes are dark regions in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet images of the Sun.
These were
discovered in the 1970s
by X-ray satellites.
Features of Solar Coronal Holes:
They appear dark because they
are cooler, less dense regions
than the surrounding plasma and are regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields.
They have
open magnetic field lines
and are hence important for understanding the interplanetary medium and space weather.
Coronal holes can last between a few weeks to months. The holes are not a unique phenomenon, appearing throughout the
sun’s approximately 11-year solar cycle.
They can
last much longer during solar minimum
– a period of time when activity on the Sun is substantially diminished, according to NASA.
Significance of Solar Coronal Holes:
The occurrences of coronal holes are associated with
disturbances in the Earth's ionosphere,
the layer of the atmosphere that reflects and modifies the radio waves, leading to further communication issues.
They have significant influence on
space weather that affects satellites
, as well as the Indian
summer monsoon rainfall.

**********What is Parkinson’s Disease (PD)?
A breakthrough study has uncovered a hidden player in Parkinson’s disease—24-OHC, a cholesterol metabolite that fuels the spread of harmful protein clumps in the brain.
About Parkinson’s Disease (PD):
It is a
progressive neurodegenerative disorder
primarily affects movement.
causes nerve cells
(neurons) in parts of the brain
to weaken, become damaged
, and die,
leading
to symptoms that include
problems with movement,
tremor, stiffness, and impaired balance.
As symptoms progress, people with PD may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.
Although many brain areas are affected in Parkinson’s disease, the
most common symptoms result from
loss of neurons in
an area near the base of the brain called the
substantia nigra.
The
neurons in this area produce dopamine.
Dopamine
is the chemical messenger that
transmits signals in the brain to produce smooth, purposeful movement.
Most people with PD have lost 60 to 80% or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra by the time symptoms appear.
Lack of dopamine causes the slowed movements and tremors symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
●
Who does it affect?
The risk of developing Parkinson’s disease naturally increases with age, and the
average age
at which it starts is
60 years old.
It’s slightly
more common in males.
Diagnosis
: Currently,
no blood laboratory or radiological tests
are available to diagnose Parkinson’s disease.

**********Mineral Resources of Ukraine
Why in news?
Former US President Donald Trump accused Ukraine of reneging on an unofficial deal granting the US access to 50% of its mineral resources in exchange for support against Russia.
What’s in today’s article?
Importance of Ukraine’s Mineral Resources
US Proposal on Ukraine’s Resources
Challenges in the US Using 50% of Ukraine’s Resources
Ukraine possesses rich mineral resources crucial for manufacturing high-end weapon systems, clean energy solutions (such as electric vehicles), electronic gadgets, and semiconductors.
These minerals are rare and difficult to extract, making them highly valuable.
Geopolitical Significance
China has large reserves of these critical minerals, making Ukraine’s resources strategically important for the US and the West.
The US seeks rare-earth elements, titanium, gallium, and other critical minerals for weapons systems, clean energy, and reducing dependence on China
US President Donald Trump’s interest in acquiring Greenland is also partly driven by mineral resource concerns.
Key Classifications of Minerals
Rare Earth Elements (REEs):
Consist of 17 elements, including 15 Lanthanides (atomic numbers 57–71), Scandium (21), and Yttrium (39).
Critical Minerals:
Defined by countries based on economic and security needs and their limited availability.
India identified 30 critical minerals
in 2023.
Ukraine views the deal as a way to secure future assistance, while Trump seeks compensation for past US aid.
The details remain undisclosed, but Trump claims Ukraine owes the US
$500 billion
worth of resources, including
minerals, fuel, and infrastructure
(such as ports), in return for military support against Russia.
This demand far exceeds the $69.2 billion in military aid the US has provided since 2014.
US officials argue that securing
economic stakes
in Ukraine—such as mining rights—would serve as a
security guarantee
, as the US would be invested in defending its interests.
Zelenskyy, however, seeks a
more concrete military and economic assurance
rather than indirect security through economic involvement.
Legal Restrictions
Ukraine’s constitution states that subsoil resources belong to its people.
Any deal must comply with Ukrainian laws.
Unclear Resource Data
The quantity and quality of Ukraine’s mineral resources remain uncertain due to limited exploration and extraction
Many geological surveys date back to the
Soviet era (pre-1991)
and lack modern data.
Existing EU Agreement
Ukraine already signed a ‘strategic partnership on raw materials’ with the European Union in July 2021, before Russia’s invasion in 2022.
This agreement complicates any new deal with the US.
Russian Occupation of Resource-Rich Areas
A significant portion of Ukraine’s minerals are in Russian-occupied territories
Russian forces control one-fifth of Ukraine, including reserves of rare earth elements.
They are now just 4 miles away from the Shevchenko lithium deposit, as per a media report

**********SC: States Must Consider Premature Release of Eligible Convicts Automatically
Why in news?
The Supreme Court ruled that states must consider the premature release of eligible prisoners under their remission policies, even if they do not apply for it.
While certain convicts are exempt, states have the authority to grant remission under the
Bharatiya Nyaya Suraksha Sanhita
, 2023 (BNSS) and the
Code of Criminal Procedure
, 1973 (CrPC).
A SC bench delivered the judgment in the suo motu case In
Re: Policy Strategy for Grant of Bail
, initiated in 2021 to address prison overcrowding.
This ruling marks a shift in the Supreme Court’s stance on remission,
departing from its
2013 judgments, which required prisoners to apply for remission
What’s in today’s article?
Law on Remission
Supreme Court’s Ruling on Remission
Additional Directions Issued by the Supreme Court
Prison Population in India
Remission refers to the reduction of a convict’s sentence.
Section
473 of the BNSS
(formerly Section 432 of the CrPC) empowers state governments to remit sentences at any time, with or without conditions.
If conditions are violated, the remission can be revoked, and the convict can be
re-arrested without a warrant
State vs. Constitutional Remission Powers
State governments exercise remission power under BNSS and CrPC.
On the other hand, Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution grant similar powers to the President and Governor respectively.
Restrictions on Remission
Under
Section 475 of the BNSS
(formerly Section 433A of the CrPC), life convicts guilty of offences punishable by death must serve at least 14 years in prison before being eligible for release.
SC’s Recent Interpretation
Earlier, remission required an application by the convict.
However, the Supreme Court has now ruled that states must consider remission automatically, as most states already have remission policies with eligibility criteria.
Past Judgments on Remission
The SC considered two 2013 rulings:
Sangeet & Anr. v. State of Haryana (2013):
Held that remission under Section 432 of CrPC cannot be granted suo motu and requires a convict’s application.
Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2013):
Reaffirmed that courts cannot grant remission on their own.
Key Shift in Approach
The court observed that many state prison manuals require the prison superintendent to initiate remission proceedings.
The previous rulings in Sangeet and Mohinder Singh did not consider cases where states have structured remission policies.
Why the SC Changed Its Stance
The Sangeet judgment aimed to prevent discretionary or mass releases on festive occasions.
However, when states have clear remission policies with eligibility criteria, the SC held that failing to consider remission automatically would be discriminatory and arbitrary.
Obligation on States
The court ruled that states must consider remission for all eligible convicts under their policies.
Ignoring this duty would violate Article 14 (Right to Equality) of the Constitution.
The SC directed all states to form a comprehensive remission policy within two months if they do not already have one.
Guidelines for Remission Conditions
Building on
Mafabhai Motibhai Sagar v. State of Gujarat
(2024), the court laid down that remission conditions must:
Consider crime motive, criminal background, and public safety.
Aim for rehabilitation and prevent recurrence of criminal tendencies.
Be reasonable—not excessively harsh or impractical.
Be clear and enforceable, avoiding vague or ambiguous terms.
Protection Against Arbitrary Remission Cancellation
Minor violations should not automatically lead to remission cancellation.
Convicts must receive a notice with reasons for cancellation.
Convicts must be given a chance to respond before the state makes a final decision.
As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data (2022):
Total inmates: 5,73,220
Total prison capacity: 4,36,266
Occupancy rate: 131.4% (overcrowded prisons)
Undertrial Prisoners Dominate
75.8% of inmates
undertrials
, still awaiting final verdicts.
The SC’s new remission guidelines may help reduce overcrowding, but undertrials remain the majority.
Trends in Premature Releases
The Prison Statistics in India Report (2022) shows:
2020: 2,321 prisoners released prematurely.
2021: 2,350 prisoners released.
2022: 5,035 prisoners released (sharp increase).
There is no official data on how many prisoners have benefitted from remission policies over the years.

**********Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013: Strengthening Anti-Corruption Framework in India
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court has stayed a Lokpal order bringing High Court judges under its jurisdiction while terming the top anti-corruption ombudsman’s interpretation very disturbing.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, About Lokpal & Lokayuktas, Significance of the Act, Challenges, etc.)
News Summary (SC Judgement, Implications)
, was introduced to combat
corruption at the highest levels of government
in India.
It provides for the establishment of the
Lokpal at the central level
Lokayuktas in states
, empowering them to investigate complaints against public officials, including the Prime Minister, Ministers, and Members of Parliament.
The Act was a result of prolonged public movements against corruption, particularly the
India Against Corruption movement
led by
Anna Hazare
It aims to bring greater transparency and accountability in governance by establishing an
independent anti-corruption body
with investigative powers.
About Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013
The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, establishes a
multi-member anti-corruption body
with the authority to investigate
allegations of corruption against high-ranking public officials
The Lokpal is responsible for handling cases at the central level, while Lokayuktas are set up by
individual states
to deal with corruption cases at the state level.
Key Features of the Act:
Establishment of Lokpal
: A central institution headed by a chairperson and up to eight members, including judicial and non-judicial members.
Jurisdiction
: Covers the Prime Minister (with certain exceptions), Ministers, MPs, and Group A and B officers of the central government
Lokayuktas in States
: Every state is required to establish a Lokayukta to investigate corruption allegations against state officials.
Inquiry and Prosecution Powers
: Lokpal has power to order inquiries, recommend prosecution, and direct disciplinary action.
Whistleblower Protection
: The Act provides safeguards for whistleblowers reporting corruption cases.
Significance of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act
Strengthening Anti-Corruption Measures
The Act provides an independent
watchdog mechanism
to investigate corruption cases at
both central and state levels
, ensuring greater transparency in public office.
Public Accountability
By bringing top government officials, including the
Prime Minister and MPs, under scrutiny
, the Act reinforces
public trust in governance
Empowering Lokpal with Investigative Powers
The Lokpal has the authority to conduct
independent inquiries and recommend prosecution
without needing prior government approval.
Ensuring State-Level Vigilance
The requirement to set up
Lokayuktas in every state
strengthens
state-level anti-corruption mechanisms
Challenges and Criticisms
Delay in Lokayukta Implementation
: Many states have
not yet appointed Lokayuktas
, weakening the state-level anti-corruption framework.
Limited Investigative Autonomy
CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation)
, which assists in investigations, still functions under government control, affecting its independence.
Lack of Public Awareness
: Many citizens are
unaware of Lokpal’s role and how to file complaints
, reducing its effectiveness.
Political Interference
: Critics argue that
appointments to Lokpal are influenced by the ruling government
, impacting its impartiality.
In a major legal development, the
Supreme Court stayed a Lokpal order
that sought to bring High Court judges under its jurisdiction.
Background of the Case:
January 27, 2025, order of Lokpal
declared that
High Court judges are 'public servants'
under the
Lokpal Act, 2013
, and can be investigated.
Supreme Court took suo motu cognizance
and halted this decision, stating it was
“very disturbing”
and could
affect the independence of the judiciary
​.
Special Bench of Justices B.R. Gavai, Surya Kant, and A.S. Oka
expressed concerns over this interpretation​.
Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and B.H. Marlapalle
provided arguments, while
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta
represented the government and opposed the Lokpal’s jurisdiction over judges.
The Supreme Court ordered that the
case be heard on March 18, 2025
, while keeping the
identity of the concerned judge confidential
Implications of the Supreme Court’s Stay:
Maintaining Judicial Independence
: The decision reinforces that judges cannot be treated as public servants under the Lokpal Act.
Clarification of Jurisdiction
: It highlights the difference between High Court and Supreme Court judges, as the Lokpal had earlier ruled that it does not have jurisdiction over Supreme Court judges.
Legal Precedent
: The case could set a precedent for future interpretations of judicial accountability under anti-corruption laws.

**********State Governments and the Union Budget - Impact on Revenues and Expenditures
Context:
State governments
are
crucial stakeholders
in the
, as their fiscal health is significantly influenced by tax devolution, grants from the Centre, and interest-free loans for capital spending.
These components form a substantial part of state revenues and shape their expenditure and deficit levels.
Tax Devolution Trends:
Overview:
Over 40% of several states' revenues come from tax devolution and grants.
The actual tax devolution
has fluctuated over the past five years, varying from initial budget estimates.
2024-25:
Tax devolution was revised upwards to Rs 12.9 trillion from Rs 12.5 trillion, reflecting adjustments for previous payments and an increase in states' share of income tax revenues.
2025-26:
Tax devolution is projected at Rs 14.2 trillion,
an 11% increase
over the previous year.
Future projections:
The impact of personal income tax modifications may lead to an optimistic revenue growth forecast, potentially affecting tax devolution.
Grants to States - Declining and Volatile Trends:
Grants from the Centre have shown
an uneven trajectory
, influenced by factors such as:
End of GST compensation grants (2022-23).
Decline in Finance Commission-recommended grants, leading to a 13% drop in total grants (Rs 7.8 trillion in 2023-24).
Further reduction of Rs 1 trillion in 2024-25 revised estimates due to lower allocations for centrally sponsored schemes and GST compensation.
2025-26 projections:
Total grants set at Rs 8.9 trillion, marking a 14% growth, surpassing the increase in tax devolution.
Capital Expenditure Loans to States:
Interest-free loans for capital expenditure have emerged as a
critical funding source
since 2020-21.
To boost the resources of state governments, the Centre has been stepping up allocation under the
special assistance scheme
as loans to states for capital expenditure.
2024-25 revised estimates:
Allocation for the capex loan scheme was reduced to Rs 1.25 trillion from Rs 1.5 trillion.
By January-end 2025, actual disbursements reached Rs 1.1 trillion, indicating robust utilization.
All 28 states availed funds under this scheme, with major recipients including
Bihar, MP, UP, and West Bengal
(40% share).
2025-26 allocation:
Rs 1.5 trillion, with disbursement influenced by the mix of tied and untied loans.
Conditional Borrowing and Power Sector Reforms:
The Centre extended the
0.5% of gross state domestic product (GSDP)
conditional borrowing linked to power sector reforms for 2025-26. In FY 2023-24, States borrowed Rs 1.2 trillion under this framework.
Initially set to end as per the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations, this extension aims to
drive critical reforms in the power sector.
This move is expected to s
trengthen state finances and support economic growth
Implications for State Capital Expenditure:
Key provisions in the Union Budget positively impact state capex:
Higher tax devolution
: Provides untied funds, offering fiscal flexibility.
Enhanced capex loan outlay
: Encourages infrastructure development.
Extension of power sector reform-linked borrowing
: Incentivizes critical sectoral reforms.
Future Outlook - 16th Finance Commission Recommendations:
State governments will closely monitor the recommendations of the 16th Finance Commission (
FY 2027-31
Key expectations include:
Deficit and debt targets for states.
Continuation of the capex loan scheme
beyond the 16th FC award period.
Potential exclusion of capex loans from the net borrowing limit.
The recommendations are expected before the Union Budget 2026-27 and will significantly shape state finances.
Conclusion:
The Union Budget significantly influences state finances through tax devolution, grants, and loans.
While tax devolution has seen an upward revision, the volatility in grants remains a concern.
The capex loan scheme and conditional borrowing linked to power sector reforms play a crucial role in shaping state fiscal health.
The upcoming
recommendations will be
critical in determining future fiscal frameworks for states.

**********The Long and Winding Road of India-China Relations
Context
visit of India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri to China
in January 2025 marked a significant diplomatic engagement,
signifying a possible thaw in tensions.
However, while both nations have announced the restoration of key exchanges,
several underlying issues,
such as border stability, economic concerns, and geopolitical influences,
continue to shape the evolving relationship
Amid these developments,
it is important to examine the factors behind the renewed engagement, the complexities at the Line of Actual Control (LAC

Diplomatic Engagements and Announcements During Foreign Secretary’s China Visit
During his visit to China,
Foreign Secretary Misri met with high-ranking Chinese officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Liu Jianchao
, Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China.
Indian government later announced the revival of various bilateral exchanges
, such as media and think-tank interactions, the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, and increased connectivity through flights.
These
initiatives suggest a strategic effort to rebuild diplomatic channels
that had been largely suspended since 2020.
these developments alone do not confirm a complete resolution of outstanding tensions
, particularly regarding military disengagement at the border.

, aggressive economic sanctions, and diplomatic hostilities.
Given his track record,
China anticipates a renewed period of U.S.-China tensions
, potentially leading to stricter trade barriers, sanctions, and geopolitical confrontations.
For China, stabilising its regional relationships
, including with India, might serve as a strategic buffer against future American pressures.
Historically,
whenever China faces external challenges, it has sought to stabilise relationships on other fronts
to prevent multiple simultaneous conflicts.
For instance,
following the 1989 Tiananmen Square crisis, China made significant diplomatic overtures to India, recognising that it needed to focus on internal stability
and economic growth.
China’s Economic Slowdown and the Need for Stability
China’s economy has been facing mounting challenges in recent years.
Sluggish growth, a real estate crisis, and
declining foreign investments have forced Beijing to rethink its economic priorities.
collapse of major real estate firms like Evergrande,
combined with falling consumer confidence and rising unemployment,
has led to increased domestic pressures on the Chinese government.
In such a scenario,
prolonged geopolitical tensions with India, one of its largest trading partners, could further strain China’s economy.
India is an important market for Chinese exports
, particularly in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing components.
Despite political tensions,
trade between the two countries remains robust. In 2023, bilateral trade exceeded $136 billion,
with China enjoying a significant trade surplus.
continued breakdown in relations could jeopardize these economic benefits,
making stability a more attractive option for China.
India’s Economic Growth and Strategic Calculations
While China grapples with economic difficulties,
India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing major economies.
With its
expanding manufacturing sector, growing middle class, and increasing foreign direct investment (FDI)
, India is positioning itself as an alternative to China in global supply chains.
Companies looking to diversify away from China
have turned to India as a key production hub. However, for India to fully capitalize on this shift, it needs geopolitical stability.
prolonged border standoff with China could deter investors
who seek a predictable business environment.
By engaging with China diplomatically, India may be attempting to ease tensions enough to create a more stable atmosphere
for economic expansion while maintaining its firm stance on border issues.
Unresolved Tensions at the LAC and the Way Forward
Despite these diplomatic strides,
ambiguity remains regarding the situation at the LAC
India has not provided a clear statement
on whether de-escalation and demobilisation of troops have occurred.
Since the Galwan clashes in June 2020,
both nations have maintained significant military presence along various flashpoints,
including Galwan, Depsang Bulge, Charding Nala, Gogra Post, Hot Springs, and the Pangong Lake region.
Without concrete evidence of troop withdrawals,
questions persist about whether the border situation has truly improved
or if India has merely accepted a status quo that favours China.
Furthermore
, India has consistently argued that border stability is a prerequisite for broader engagement
, while China has taken the opposite stance, insisting that other aspects of the relationship should progress irrespective of border disputes.
If India remains silent on whether pre-2020 border arrangements have been restored
, it risks conceding to China's narrative that the conflict is no longer a pressing issue.
The Way Forward: The Need for Clarity and Strategic Caution
Indian government’s guarded approach
to communicating progress at the LAC raises concerns.
clearer articulation of India’s position is necessary
to reassure domestic and international audiences that its core interests are being upheld.
While diplomatic prudence is understandable,
a lack of transparency could weaken India’s negotiating position and allow China’s perspective
to dominate international discourse.
India-China relations have historically been cyclical
, fluctuating between periods of cooperation and tension.
Given the structural differences in their geopolitical outlooks,
their bilateral relationship is unlikely to achieve full convergence soon.
Thus,
India must exercise caution
and ensure that diplomatic engagements do not come at the cost of territorial or strategic compromises.
Conclusion
India’s recent engagement with China represents
a step toward diplomatic normalization, but critical uncertainties remain.
While economic and geopolitical considerations may have driven this shift,
the lack of clarity on the border situation raises valid concerns.
As India moves forward,
it must balance diplomacy with firm strategic positioning to ensure that any restoration of relations does not come at the expense of its security interests
Greater transparency and a principled approach will be essential
in maintaining an equitable and stable relationship with China.

**********The Transformation of Koraput’s Tribal Food Basket
Context
Koraput, a district in Odisha
is a region of breathtaking landscapes
and rich biodiversity, it also
suffers from persistent poverty and high levels of undernutrition.
Despite the presence of various government schemes aimed at improving food security and livelihoods,
malnutrition remains widespread.
According to the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21),
a staggering 43% of children under five in the district are stunted,
and 33% are underweight.
Moreover,
only 17% of children receive an adequate diet, and over 50% of women are anaemic;
given these alarming statistics, it is crucial to examine how the local community can take ownership of its nutrition security.
The Community-Based Nutrition Literacy Model
implemented in Koraput by the
M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF).
It was designed to
empower tribal communities
by enhancing their understanding of nutrition and equipping them with the skills to make informed dietary choices.
The model was rooted in the principle that
sustainable solutions to undernutrition must emerge from within the community itself
, rather than relying solely on external aid.
It emphasised
nutrition-sensitive agriculture, dietary diversity, hygiene, sanitation, and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices
Approach Taken by MSSRF
Awareness and Self-Assessment
The first step in implementing the model was
to sensitise the community to its own nutritional challenges.
To achieve this,
health and nutrition data of women, children, and adolescents were collected through height and weight measurement
s and consolidated with secondary data sources.
results were presented to the community,
allowing them to visualize the extent of malnutrition among their own people.
This method was crucial because rather than being told they were undernourished
; the villagers saw the evidence firsthand.
Selection of Community Representatives for Training
Once the community acknowledged the issue,
villagers selected representatives, both men and women, from different villages and caste groups
to undergo residential training programs.
ensured inclusivity and representation of diverse social groups.
participants were chosen based on their willingness to learn and share knowledge, as they would later become ‘community champions
’ responsible for spreading awareness and implementing solutions at the village level.
Mobilising Collective Action
While social structures in rural communities are often hierarchical,
the residential training created a neutral space
where villagers from different backgrounds could engage in open discussions.
bridged social divides and fostered collective action
Participants collaborated to introduce more nutritious crops
, share farming techniques, and advocate for government entitlements.
They realised that rather than making individual efforts
, collective bargaining at the panchayat (local governance) level could lead to greater access to resources and schemes.
To spread awareness beyond the training group,
participants created songs and messages on topics like balanced diets, hygiene, and sanitation.
These songs were then performed in villages
, markets, and festivals, helping embed key nutritional messages into everyday life.
Some Other Steps Taken by the Local Community in Koraput to Take the Ownership of their Nutritional Security
Tangible Changes in Nutrition and Agriculture
The impact of these efforts
was visible in the community’s dietary habits and farming practices.
Home gardens
, which initially contained only four types of crops,
grew to include nine varieties.
Similarly, crop diversity in larger farms expanded
from two or three varieties to as many as five.
Households began consuming a wider range of nutrient-rich foods
, including pulses, leafy vegetables, tubers, fruits, poultry, and fish.
Some even adopted bio composting techniques
to enhance soil fertility.
program also empowered women
, who played a crucial role in improving family nutrition.
Many worked closely with health workers
such as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Anganwadi workers to spread awareness about dietary needs.
For example,
one woman, Sanya from Maligad village, ensured her anaemic daughter received a balanced diet of leafy vegetables, ripe fruits, pulses, and eggs.
Strengthening Community Institutions
Beyond individual households,
the program led to the strengthening of community structures
that support nutrition security.
Villagers took an active role in monitoring direct feeding programs under the Integrated
Child Development Services (ICDS).
In one instance, when the village of Lecha lacked an Anganwadi centre,
women champions organised meetings to demand one.
village collectively passed a resolution
, and their male counterparts followed up with local authorities until the request was granted.
They even supervised the construction of the centre
and ensured its proper inauguration.
Additionally,
the community revived traditional institutions such as grain banks and engaged in village council meetings (Gram Sabhas)
to discuss long-term strategies for achieving hunger-free villages.
These collective efforts have laid the foundation for sustained improvements in nutrition and food security in Koraput.
Conclusion
transformation witnessed in Koraput highlights the power of community-driven initiatives
in addressing undernutrition.
By combining nutrition literacy with sustainable agricultural practices,
the MSSRF program enabled villagers to take control of their own food security.
success of this approach underscores the importance of integrating local knowledge with scientific principles
while fostering collective action.
As the community continues its journey
toward better nutrition and food security,
its experiences serve as an inspiring model for other regions facing similar challenges.

**********[21st February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: Is consumption enough to drive growth?
Economics
PYQ Relevance:
) Explain the difference between the computing methodology of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) before the year 2015 and after the year 2015.
(UPSC CSE 2021)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
India’s Gross Domestic Product  (2021),
India from realizing its potential GDP
(2020).
An economy grows through two key factors:
supply (production of goods and services)
demand (spending on these goods and services)
. Among demand sources,
investment is crucial
as it creates a
multiplier effect
, boosting jobs and income.
Consumption follows growth but cannot drive it alone
, as sustainable expansion requires strong investment and production.
Today’s editorial talks about India’s GDP growth factors based on demand and supply. This content would help in GS Paper 3 mains Paper.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
An economy’s growth is like navigating two interconnected boats—one representing the supply or production of goods and services.
Consumption plays a crucial role in driving economic growth, but it is not sufficient on its own for sustainable long-term growth.
Consumption-Led Growth is Slower:
While consumption boosts demand, it does not create long-term productive capacity.
Example
: India’s GDP growth in recent years has been driven by consumption (60.3% of GDP in 2023), but it lags behind China’s investment-driven growth.
Limited Multiplier Effect:
Unlike investment, increased consumption has a weaker impact on overall income and job creation.
: If people buy more smartphones, it benefits retailers but does not significantly boost domestic production if phones are imported.
Investment is Crucial for Sustainable Growth:
Higher investment in infrastructure, industries, and technology leads to job creation and productivity gains.
: China’s high investment rate (41.3% of GDP in 2023) has helped it achieve rapid economic growth and higher per capita income than India.
Why is economic growth dependent on two factors?
Balanced Growth Requires Both Supply & Demand:
Economic growth happens when
goods and services are produced (supply)
purchased (demand)
in a balanced manner.
: A country increasing factory production (supply) must also have enough consumers to buy the products (demand), ensuring sustainable growth.
Mismatch Leads to Economic Problems
If demand > supply
, inflation rises due to excessive spending with limited goods.
If supply > demand
, businesses suffer from unsold stock, leading to job losses.
: Post-pandemic, supply chain disruptions led to high demand but low supply, causing inflation.
Investment Drives Long-Term Growth:
Investment in infrastructure, industries, and technology
increases production capacity (supply)
while also creating jobs, which boosts
spending power (demand)
: China’s high investment in infrastructure and manufacturing led to rapid economic growth by expanding both supply and demand.
Government Policies Impact Both Sides:
Fiscal and monetary policies help balance
supply-side growth
(e.g., industrial incentives) and
demand-side expansion
(e.g., tax cuts or subsidies).
: India’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme boosts manufacturing (supply), while government social schemes increase purchasing power (demand).
Exports and Imports Affect Domestic Growth:
A strong
export sector
increases supply, bringing foreign exchange, while controlled imports ensure domestic industries remain competitive.
: India’s IT exports generate revenue (supply), while consumer imports like electronics influence domestic demand.
What role does investment play in economic growth?
Boosts Production Capacity:
Investment in factories, infrastructure, and technology increases the ability to produce goods and services, leading to higher GDP.
: China’s heavy investment in manufacturing and infrastructure helped it become the world’s largest exporter.
Creates Employment Opportunities:
New industries and infrastructure projects generate jobs, increasing income and overall demand in the economy.
: India’s road and metro projects have created millions of direct and indirect jobs, boosting economic activity.
Multiplier Effect on Demand & GDP:
Investment leads to increased income, which in turn increases consumption and demand, further driving growth.
: A ₹100 investment in building highways can create ₹125 in overall economic output due to increased business activities along the route.
Encourages Private Sector Confidence:
When the government invests in key sectors, it builds confidence among private businesses to invest further.
: India’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for electronics manufacturing has attracted global tech firms to set up production units.
Leads to Technological and Industrial Development:
Investments in research, innovation, and new industries enhance productivity and global competitiveness.
: South Korea’s investment in R&D and technology made it a leader in electronics and automobile industries.
How have India and China experienced changes in per capita income?
Similar Per Capita Incomes in the Early 1990s:
In the early 1990s,
India and China had nearly equal per capita incomes
, with both countries being
1.5% of the U.S. average
. Example: In 1992, both nations were considered low-income economies with similar economic structures.
China’s Investment-Led Growth Model:
China prioritized
high investment rates
, focusing on
infrastructure, state-owned enterprises, and manufacturing
1992, China’s investment rate was 39.1% of GDP
, much higher than
India’s 27.4%
Diverging Growth Post-2000s:
India’s investment rate
rose to 35.8% in 2007
, almost matching China’s, but declined after 2012 due to
policy uncertainty and global economic slowdown
.Example: By
2013, China’s investment rate increased to 44.5%
India’s fell to 31.3%
China’s Faster Rise in Per Capita Income:
By 2023, China’s per capita income was 5 times India’s in nominal terms and 2.4 times higher in purchasing power parity (PPP). Example: As a percentage of U.S. per capita income in 2023: China: 15%, India: 3%.
India’s Consumption-Driven Growth Model:
India’s economic growth has been
mainly driven by domestic consumption
, while China maintained
higher investment levels
In 2023, consumption was 60.3% of India’s GDP
, compared to
39.1% in China
Long-Term Impact on Growth and Inequality:
lower investment and trade deficits
have led to
slower per capita income growth
, affecting job creation and economic equality. Example:
China’s investment rate in 2023 was 41.3%
, whereas
India’s was only 30.8%
, limiting economic expansion.
What measures has the Indian government taken to promote investment in India?
Infrastructure Development:
The government has launched
massive infrastructure projects
to boost investment and improve connectivity.
PM Gati Shakti
(National Master Plan) aims to integrate multi-modal transport networks and reduce logistics costs.
Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme:
Introduced to
boost manufacturing and attract foreign and domestic investments
in key sectors.
: PLI schemes for
electronics, pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy
have encouraged global firms to set up production in India.
Corporate Tax Reforms:
reduced corporate tax rates
to make the investment climate more competitive.
: In 2019, the corporate tax rate was
slashed to 22% for existing companies
15% for new manufacturing firms
Ease of Doing Business & FDI Reforms: Simplified regulatory processes, digital approvals, and single-window clearances
to attract investments.
100% FDI
allowed in sectors like
defense, telecom, and insurance
under automatic route.
Way forward:
Enhancing Investment-Led Growth
: India should focus on increasing capital formation by boosting infrastructure, industrial productivity, and R&D investments. Strengthening public-private partnerships (PPPs) and expanding the PLI scheme to emerging sectors can accelerate long-term economic growth.
Balancing Consumption and Supply-Side Expansion
: While consumption remains a key driver, policies should encourage domestic manufacturing and export competitiveness to reduce reliance on imports. Strengthening skill development and labour market reforms will enhance productivity and job creation.
**********SC stays Lokpal order on power over judges
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to the Judiciary;
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court recently halted a Lokpal order that sought to include High Court judges under its jurisdiction, calling the anti-corruption body’s interpretation “very disturbing.”
Why did the Supreme Court stay the Lokpal order?
Violation of Judicial Independence (Article 50 & Article 121):
The Supreme Court held that bringing High Court judges under Lokpal’s jurisdiction
undermines judicial independence
, which is a part of the
Basic Structure Doctrine
mandates the
separation of the judiciary from the executive
, preventing interference in judicial functioning.
prohibits Parliament from discussing the conduct of judges except in matters of impeachment, reinforcing judicial autonomy.
Judges Are Appointed Under the Constitution (Article 124 & Article 217):
The Supreme Court rejected Lokpal’s argument that High Courts were created by British laws, emphasizing that
all judges are appointed under the Constitution
establishes the Supreme Court, while
governs the appointment of High Court judges, ensuring their independence from executive control.
Judicial Oversight Is an Internal Process (Article 124(4) & Article 217(1)(b)):
The Supreme Court reaffirmed that
judicial misconduct should be handled internally
, either through the
in-house procedure
or the
impeachment process
(for Supreme Court judges) and
(for High Court judges) provide for removal only through
Parliamentary impeachment
, making external investigations by the Lokpal unconstitutional.
What is suo motu case?
Suo motu
(Latin:
on its own motion
) refers to the Supreme Court or High Courts taking up a case
on their own initiative
, without a formal petition being filed.
In which circumstances do courts in India exercise suo motu powers?
Constitutional Concerns (Separation of Powers, Judicial Independence):
Courts intervene
when an issue threatens constitutional principles like the
separation of powers
Example:
In re: Article 370 of the Constitution
(2023) – The Supreme Court took up the matter of
abrogation of Article 370
to examine whether the Union government’s decision upheld constitutional principles.
Fundamental Rights Violations:
Courts act
when fundamental rights under
Articles 14 (equality), 19 (freedom), and 21 (right to life)
are violated.
Suo Motu Writ Petition (Criminal) No.1 of 2020
– The Supreme Court intervened during
COVID-19 migrant crisis
, directing the government to provide food, shelter, and transport to stranded workers.
Public Interest or Institutional Integrity:
Courts take
suo motu cognizance
to protect public interest and prevent harm to democratic institutions.
Suo Motu Cognizance of Lakhimpur Kheri Violence (2021)
– The Supreme Court intervened to monitor the
UP government’s investigation
into the killing of protesting farmers, ensuring transparency and accountability.
Why did the Lokpal order bring High Court judges under its jurisdiction?
Interpretation of ‘Public Servants’ Under Lokpal Act:
The Lokpal classified High Court judges as
public servants
Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013
, making them subject to its jurisdiction.
Reliance on Section 14(1)(f) of the Lokpal Act:
This section grants Lokpal jurisdiction over any
body or authority established by an Act of Parliament
The Lokpal argued that High Courts were
established by British Parliamentary Acts
(Indian High Courts Act, 1861 & Government of India Act, 1935), making them fall within this clause.
Distinction Between High Courts and Supreme Court:
The Lokpal reasoned that
Article 124 of the Constitution explicitly established the Supreme Court
, but
Article 214 only recognized High Courts
, implying that High Courts were not directly created by the Constitution.
Based on this, the Lokpal ruled that Supreme Court judges were outside its jurisdiction, but High Court judges were not.
Lack of Explicit Exemption for Judges:
2013 Lokpal Act does not explicitly exclude High Court judges
from its jurisdiction, which the Lokpal interpreted as allowing it to investigate them.
Case-Specific Justification:
The complaint involved a High Court judge allegedly influencing judicial decisions for personal benefit. The Lokpal argued that since the judge was serving in a High Court of a
State reorganized by an Act of Parliament
, it had jurisdiction over the matter.
Way forward:
Judicial Accountability Within Constitutional Framework:
Strengthen in-house mechanisms for judicial oversight while ensuring compliance with constitutional provisions like Articles 124(4) and 217(1)(b), which mandate impeachment as the sole removal process for judges.
Clarify Lokpal’s Jurisdiction Through Legislative Review:
Amend the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, to explicitly define its jurisdiction, ensuring it does not encroach upon judicial independence while maintaining transparency in the judiciary.
Mains PYQ:
Judicial Legislation is antithetical to the doctrine of separation of powers as envisaged in the Indian Constitution. In this context justify the filing of large number of public interest petitions praying for issuing guidelines to executive authorities.

**********The long and winding road of India-China relations
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India-China relation;

What are the challenges between India and China?
Border Disputes and Military Standoff:
The unresolved
Line of Actual Control (LAC)
dispute remains a major flashpoint. Example: The
2020 Galwan Valley clash
led to casualties on both sides and heightened tensions, leading to prolonged military deployments in Ladakh.
Trade Imbalance and Economic Restrictions:
India faces a significant
trade deficit
with China, as it imports more than it exports. Example: In
2023, India’s trade deficit with China exceeded $100 billion
, prompting India to impose restrictions on Chinese investments and apps.
Geopolitical Rivalry and Strategic Alliances:
Both countries compete for
influence in South Asia, the Indian Ocean, and global institutions
. Example: China’s
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
, which India opposes, includes projects in
Pakistan and Sri Lanka
, challenging India’s regional influence.
China’s Support to Pakistan and India’s Response:
close ties with Pakistan
, including military and economic aid, pose security concerns for India. Example: China’s role in
developing Gwadar Port in Pakistan
and supplying weapons to Pakistan’s military affects India’s security calculus.
Tensions in Multilateral Forums:
India and China often
clash diplomatically
in international organizations. Example: China has
blocked India’s bid for UNSC permanent membership
and has
repeatedly blocked India’s attempts to list Pakistan-based terrorists in the UN
What measures has the Indian government taken after the Galwan clash?
Strengthening Military Presence and Infrastructure at LAC:
India rapidly deployed additional troops, upgraded surveillance, and enhanced military infrastructure along the
India constructed all-weather roads, bridges, and airstrips, such as the
Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DSDBO) road
in Ladakh, to improve troop movement.
Ban on Chinese Apps and Economic Restrictions:
The government
banned over 300 Chinese apps
, citing security concerns and took steps to reduce economic dependence on China.
TikTok, PUBG Mobile, WeChat
AliExpress
were among the banned apps, impacting China’s digital market in India.
Increased Focus on Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India):
India pushed for
domestic manufacturing in defense, telecom, and electronics
to reduce reliance on Chinese imports.
The government placed restrictions on Chinese firms participating in
5G trials
, and promoted Indian alternatives in the telecom sector.
Diplomatic and Strategic Realignments:
India strengthened partnerships with like-minded countries to counterbalance China’s influence.
India reinforced ties with the
Quad alliance (U.S., Japan, Australia, India)
, holding
Malabar naval exercises
to enhance security cooperation.
Revised Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policies:
India introduced stricter FDI regulations, requiring
government approval for investments from China
and other neighboring countries.
The new
FDI rules in 2020
prevented automatic approvals for Chinese investments in Indian startups and infrastructure projects.
Way forward:
Strengthening Diplomatic and Strategic Engagement:
India and China should prioritize sustained
diplomatic dialogue
confidence-building measures
to prevent conflicts and enhance cooperation in multilateral forums.
Establishing a structured mechanism for
LAC dispute resolution
and expanding
bilateral trade dialogues
to address economic concerns.
Enhancing Economic and Technological Self-Reliance:
India should continue efforts toward
by boosting
, diversifying supply chains, and strengthening
critical sectors like semiconductors and defence
Expanding the
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme
to reduce dependency on Chinese imports and developing strategic alliances for
tech collaborations

topological conductors
, making qubits more stable and resistant to errors.
Features of Majorana 1 Chip:
Uses topological qubits
, which require less error correction compared to traditional superconducting qubits.
More scalable
, allowing the quantum chip to reach up to
1 million qubits
in the future.
Built from indium arsenide-aluminum topo-conductors
, unlike conventional silicon-based quantum chips.
Operates at near absolute zero temperature
, tuned with magnetic fields to create a stable quantum environment.
Currently an 8-qubit chip
, but designed with an architecture that supports significant expansion.
What is Quantum Computing?
Quantum computing
is a new approach to computation based on the principles of
quantum mechanics
that allows computers to process information exponentially faster than classical computers.
Unlike classical computers that use
binary bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits
, which can exist in
both 0 and 1 simultaneously (superposition)
Key Principles of Quantum Computing:
Superposition:
Qubits exist in multiple states at once.
Entanglement:
–Qubits can be linked, meaning a change in one affects the other instantly.
Quantum Tunneling:
Qubits can pass through energy barriers.
Quantum Interference:
Enhances correct probabilities while canceling out incorrect ones.
Quantum computers
solve complex problems
that are impossible for classical computers, such as simulating molecules, optimizing logistics, and advancing AI.

**********NGT Report on Ganga Water Quality
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
BOD
Why in the News?
The
National Green Tribunal (NGT)
has raised concerns over the
water quality of the Ganga at Triveni Sangam
Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh
. The river is failing to meet
bathing standards
due to
high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and faecal coliform contamination
Key Findings of the Ganga Water Quality Assessment at Triveni Sangam:
Water is
unsafe for bathing
as per
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) standards
BOD levels exceeded
the permissible limit of 3 mg/L on multiple days in January 2025.
Government releasing 10,000-11,000 cusecs
of fresh water to improve quality.
Faecal coliform levels (E. coli) far exceed safe limits
due to sewage contamination.
Safe limit:
2,500 MPN/100 ml;
Detected levels:
49,000 MPN/100 ml (Ganga) and 33,000 MPN/100 ml (Yamuna).
What is Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)?
BOD measures the amount of
oxygen required by bacteria to break down organic matter
in water.
Higher BOD
levels indicate
higher organic pollution
, which can lead to oxygen depletion and aquatic life destruction.
for bathing water is
below 3 mg/L
Excessive BOD levels suggest
sewage, industrial waste, or decomposing organic matter
BOD levels above safe limits
can cause waterborne diseases
and disrupt aquatic ecosystems.
PYQ:
[2017]
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a standard criterion for:
(a) Measuring oxygen levels in blood
(b) Computing oxygen levels in forest ecosystems
(c) Pollution assay in aquatic ecosystems
(d) Assessing oxygen levels in high-altitude regions
