FIVE EYES
Syllabus
Prelims & Mains – INTERNATIONAL
Context:
Five Eyes supports Canada in spat with India.
Background: –
Citing alleged involvement in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, Canada has expelled six Indian diplomats. In a tit-for-tat move, India too expelled six Canadian diplomats.
About Fiver Eyes
The Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing alliance consisting of five countries: United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
The alliance was initially formed during World War II for sharing signals intelligence (SIGINT) and has since evolved into a broader intelligence cooperation framework.
It is based on the UKUSA Agreement, a multilateral agreement for cooperation in intelligence activities, particularly concerning signals intelligence.
Key Features:
Intelligence Sharing: The Five Eyes share a wide range of intelligence, including military, political, security, and cyber intelligence.
Scope: Initially focused on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Five Eyes now addresses global security threats such as terrorism, cybercrime, and state-sponsored espionage.
Technology and Surveillance: The alliance members operate extensive signals intelligence infrastructure and conduct joint surveillance operations on potential security threats worldwide.
Historical Background:
The UKUSA Agreement was formalized in 1946, primarily between the United States and the United Kingdom. Over time, the agreement was expanded to include Canada (1948), Australia, and New Zealand (both in 1956).
The Five Eyes network became central during the Cold War in monitoring and intercepting Soviet communications.
In the post-Cold War period, it expanded its scope to cover threats like terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and cybersecurity.

THIRD-PARTY LITIGATION FUNDING (TPLF)
Mains – GS 2
: The idea of Third-Party Litigation Funding (TPLF) has quickly emerged as a game-changer, potentially opening courtroom doors for many who felt they had been shut out.
The need for TPLF in India is painfully clear, given the massive pendency and skyrocketing litigation expenses. Justice is increasingly becoming a luxury only a few can afford.
Key takeaways
Third-Party Litigation Funding (TPLF), also known as litigation finance, is a financial arrangement where a third party (usually a private firm or investor) provides the  funds necessary to pursue a legal case in exchange for a share of the proceeds if  the case is successful.
The Supreme Court in a landmark judgment Bar Council of India v. A.K. Balaji cautiously gave green signal to TPLF, viewing it as ‘a potential equaliser in the courtroom’ and categorically holding that TPLF was not off-limits as long as lawyers were not the ones bankrolling such cases.
The ripple effects of TPLF could reach every corner of India. In fact, we may witness situations with consumer groups taking on food adulterators, tech startups withstanding pressure against industry giants, tribes supported by NGOs taking on mining mafias without fear of financial ruin.
TPLF might breathe new air into Public Interest Litigation, a powerful tool for social change since the 1980s.
Key Concerns regarding TPLF
Cherry-Picking Profitable Cases: Funders may prioritize profitable cases, potentially neglecting socially important but less lucrative claims.
Funder’s Influence on Case Strategy: Questions arise over how much control funders should have in case decisions, emphasizing the need for regulation.
Lack of National Framework in India: Although states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Gujarat have amended civil procedure codes to recognize TPLF, there is no comprehensive national regulatory framework.
Need for Regulation:
A regulatory structure should ensure:
Financial soundness and ethical conduct of funders.
Transparency in funding agreements.
Protection of clients’ decision-making rights.
Reasonable caps on funders’ profits.
Oversight Body: Establishing a dedicated authority to monitor and regulate TPLF is essential for effective governance.
Like Hong Kong’s Code of Practice for Third Party Funding in Arbitration 2019, India must ensure funders disclose financing details, manage adverse costs, and clarify the extent of funder control.
TPLF presents both a challenge and an opportunity. By developing targeted and comprehensive regulations tailored to India’s unique legal landscape, the country can foster a thriving ecosystem. In doing so, India might set a new global standard, balancing financial innovation with the fundamental right to justice.

BENCHMARK DISABILITY PER SE NO BAR FOR ADMISSIONS
The Supreme Court ruled that only the existence of the benchmark permanent disability of 40 per cent does not bar a candidate from being considered for admission to an educational institution unless a medical assessment board is of the opinion that the disability will come in the way of pursuing the course.
Confirming the admission of a candidate with 45 per cent permanent disability for the MBBS course, SC held that quantified disability per se will not disentitle a candidate with benchmark disability from being considered for admission. The candidate will be eligible if the Disability Assessment Board opines that notwithstanding the disability the candidate can pursue the course in question.
Key take aways from the judgement
The Disability Assessment Boards assessing the candidates should positively record whether the disability of the candidate will or will not come in the way of pursuing the course. The Disability Assessment Board should state reasons in the event of concluding that the candidate is not eligible for pursuing the course.
Referring to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016, the bench underlined the need to follow the principle of reasonable accommodation as laid down in Section 2(y) of the Act.
The section defines “reasonable accommodation” as necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments, without imposing a disproportionate or undue burden in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise of rights equally with others.
The court went on to say that the mandate of the law is to ensure full and effective participation of persons with disabilities in society. To achieve this, conditions that hinder their equal participation should be excluded. A broad interpretation of “reasonable accommodation” is necessary to fulfill the objectives of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act and Article 41 of the Directive Principles of State Policy.
Additional Information
December 3 is marked by the UN as International Day of Persons with Disabilities in a bid to promote a more inclusive and accessible world for the differently-abled and to raise awareness for their rights.
About 2.2% of India’s population lives with some kind of physical or mental disability, as per the National Statistics Office report on disability in 2020.
Rural men had the highest prevalence of disability in India, according to the NSO report. A higher proportion of men were disabled in India compared with women, and disability was more prevalent in rural areas than in urban areas. Inability to move without assistance was the most common disability.
The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 gave effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2006, and entered into force in 2008. India ratified the convention in 2007.
The 2016 Act, which repealed and replaced The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunity, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, commenced in April 2017.

NORTH KOREA BLOWS UP KEY ROAD LINKS TO SOUTH KOREA
Prelims – GEOGRAPHY
North Korea detonated explosives on key road and railway links connecting its territory to South Korea.
<img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-198835 size-full" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="835" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gorf.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gorf.png 902w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gorf-300x278.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gorf-768x711.png 768w" width="902"/>
Although these roads had not been in use for years, their destruction is symbolically important. The two Koreas remain divided by one of the world’s most heavily fortified borders.
Key takeaways.
During the period of inter-Korean détente in the 2000s, the two Koreas reopened two roadways and two railway lines across their heavily fortified border. However, their use was gradually halted as tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program and other issues escalated.
The explosions followed recent accusations from North Korea that South Korea had been flying propaganda-laden drones over Pyongyang (North Korean Capital).
Earlier this month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un scrapped his policy of seeking peaceful reunification with the South, describing the relationship as one between “two hostile nations.”
About North Korea – South Korea Border
The border between North Korea and South Korea is known as the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).
It runs roughly along the 38th parallel, dividing the Korean Peninsula into two separate nations.
The DMZ is approximately 250 kilometers long and about 4 kilometers wide, making it one of the most heavily militarized borders in the world.
The DMZ was established following the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953, which ended the Korean War in a ceasefire (not a peace treaty), leaving North and South Korea technically still at war.
Military Demarcation Line (MDL):
Within the DMZ lies the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), which is the actual border between the two countries.
The border is symbolic of the Cold War divide, with North Korea (DPRK) being a communist regime and South Korea (ROK) a democratic state allied with the United States.

INDIA – CANADA RELATIONS
In a sharp escalation of the row between the two countries, India ordered the expulsion of six Canadian diplomats, while also announcing its decision to withdraw the Indian High Commissioner to Canada and “other targeted diplomats”, citing security concerns after Ottawa identified them as “persons of interest” in its investigation into the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.
While a Reuters report, citing a Canadian government source, said Canada had “expelled six Indian diplomats”, India said the diplomats were being withdrawn due to security concerns. In a seemingly tit-for-tat response India announced its decision to expel six Canadian diplomats.
Significance of India-Canada Relations:
Bilateral trade in goods was approximately $ 9.9 billion and in services, it was 6.5 billion in 2022.
Canada hosts one of the largest Indian Diasporas in the world, accounting for more than 3% of the total Canadian population.
The science and technology collaboration mainly promotes industrial R&D with a focus on creating new IPs, processes, prototypes, and products. Since the 1990s, India and Canada have cooperated in space science. ANTRIX, the Commercial arm of ISRO, has launched several nanosatellites from Canada.
The Civil Nuclear Agreement of 2010 facilitated Canada to provide uranium for Indian nuclear reactors as part of the agreement.
Canada’s Indo-Pacific Policy acknowledges China as a “disruptive global power” and underscores India as a “critical partner” for collaboration in shared interests.
Issues/Challenges in India-Canada Relations:
During the Cold War, Canada was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), while India pursued a policy of non-alignment.
Canada endorsed a plebiscite in Kashmir, which ran counter to India’s interests.
After India’s nuclear tests in 1998, Canada temporarily halted potential nuclear cooperation with India.
Canada’s immigration system enables individuals with a contentious past to acquire citizenship and utilize that position to engage in activities against other nations. This presents a substantial obstacle to upholding robust bilateral relations in today’s interconnected global landscape.
The current coalition government in Canada is with the alliance of parties Pro-Khalistan parties enabling the particular stand.
A Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between these countries is pending since 2010. CEPA between them could boost bilateral trade by as much as $6.5 billion, yielding a GDP gain of $3.8 billion to $5.9 billion for Canada by 2035.
Canada is meddling in India’s domestic affairs. For example, during the farmers’ protests in India, the Canadian PM expressed his support for the farmers, stating that the situation was a cause for concern.
Way Forward:
The first step towards improving relations involves pausing the current escalation. Each side should express their concerns without disrupting the status quo. Diplomacy, not expulsions or service suspensions, should be the way forward.
Canada should carefully balance the empowerment of immigrant communities. It should assess their activities and influence, avoiding undue political or economic sway.
People endorsing violence, separatism, or terrorism should be held accountable for the abuse of freedom of expression.
Both countries should collaborate under the Framework for Cooperation on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism, established in 2018.

**********West Nile virus
Ukraine is grappling with a severe outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV), with health officials raising alarms as the death toll rises.
About West Nile virus:
West Nile Virus (WNV) is a member of the
flavivirus genus
and belongs to the family Flaviviridae.
It was
first isolated
in a woman in the West Nile district of
Uganda in 1937.
It is commonly found in
Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America
West Asia.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it typically spikes between the summer and autumn months of June and September.
Transmission:
Human infection is most often the result of
bites from infected mosquitoes.
Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds, which circulate the virus in their blood for a few days.
The virus may also be transmitted through contact with other infected animals, their blood, or other tissues.
Symptoms:
Infection with WNV is either
asymptomatic
(no symptoms) in
around 80% of infected people,
or can lead to West Nile fever or severe West Nile disease.
20% of people
who become
infected with WNV
will develop West Nile fever and symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness, and body aches, nausea, vomiting, occasionally with a skin rash.
So far, 19 countries, including Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Türkiye and Kosovo have reported outbreaks.
Treatment: No vaccine
is available for WNV and only supportive treatments can be provided to neuroinvasive WNV patients.

**********What is the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)?
The Centre's air pollution control panel for Delhi-NCR recently directed state governments in the region to implement the first stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).
About Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP):
GRAP is a framework designed to
combat air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region.
It was introduced as an
emergency response mechanism
, and its implementation is triggered
when the Air Quality Index
(AQI)
reaches "poor" levels.
GRAP is particularly
important during the winter months
when air quality tends to plummet.
Who implements GRAP?
Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)
in NCR and adjoining areas
oversees the implementation of GRAP.
It collaborates with the
Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC).
CAQM has constituted a sub-committee
for the operationalization of the GRAP.
This body includes officials from the CAQM, member secretaries of pollution control boards of Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, the Central Pollution Control Board, a scientist from the IMD, one from the IITM, and a Health Advisor.
The sub-committee is
required to meet frequently to issue orders
to invoke the GRAP.
orders and directions
of the CAQM will prevail
in case of
any
conflict between directions
issued
by the State governments
and the CAQM.
Different stages of GRAP:
GRAP consists of
four stages
, each
with targeted actions t
o be taken by the necessary authorities and agencies. These are the following:
Stage I
: "

What is the Air Quality Index (AQI)?
AQI is issued
by government agencies to gauge air pollution levels
and communicate risks to the public.
It indicates how air pollution can affect health, with higher AQI values indicating more severe health concerns.
The AQI is
calculated based on air pollutant concentrations over a specific period
, and the results are
categorised into ranges
with corresponding health advisories.
According to the AQI scale, the air quality check between
0 and 50 is "Good

**********What is Kaizen?
The month-long strike at Samsung’s manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu has brought to the spotlight the stressful working conditions in these factories shaped and determined by their management philosophy, which draws inspiration from the Japanese production method called Kaizen.
About Kaizen:
Kaizen is a compound of two
Japanese words
that together
translate as "good change" or "improvement."
Japanese business philosophy
encourages continuous improvement
involving employees at all levels
of a company.
The concept of kaizen encompasses a wide range of ideas.
Those include making the work environment more efficient by creating a
team atmosphere
improving processes
and procedures, ensuring
employee engagement
, and
making jobs more fulfilling
less tiring,
and safer.
goal
of Kaizen is to
make small changes
over a period of time
to drive continuous improvement within a company.
The Kaizen process recognizes that small changes now can add up to
huge impacts in the future.
Ultimately, that can mean better quality control, more efficient processes, and the elimination of waste, among other benefits.
Under Kaizen,
improvements
can be initiated by any employee
at any time.
philosophy is that everyone has a stake in the company's success,
and everyone should strive, at all times, to help make the business better.

**********What is Third-Party Litigation Funding (TPLF)?
The idea of Third-Party Litigation Funding (TPLF) has quickly emerged as a game-changer, potentially opening courtroom doors for many who felt they had been shut out.
About Third-Party Litigation Funding (TPLF):
TPLF, often referred to as
litigation finance
, is a financial arrangement in which a
third party
(with no prior connection to the litigation) in a legal dispute
provides funding to
support the plaintiff's pursuit of a legal claim.
In return
the third-party
funder
receives a portion of the proceeds
if the case is successful.
Plaintiffs do not have to repay
the funding
if their lawsuit is not successful.
This funding model allows entities to bring lawsuits without shouldering the financial risks associated with litigation.
The emergence of TPLF has been
driven by various factors
, including the
escalating costs
of legal proceedings, the complexity of modern litigation, and the
desire to level the playing field between parties
with disparate financial resources.
Disputes
that attract TPLF generally include
commercial contracts, international commercial arbitration, class action suits, tortious claims like medical malpractice and personal injury claims, anti-trust proceedings, insolvency proceedings, and other like
claims that have
calculated chance of
resulting in a
substantial monetary award.
TPF is
not expressly prohibited in India
. In fact,
several judgments
highlight its benefits and
express that there is a need for its regulation

**********Bushveld Igneous Complex
Researchers recently discovered pockets of living microbes in a 2-billion-year-old rock from the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, providing insights into early life on Earth and potentially aiding the search for life on Mars.
About Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC):
It is the
largest layered igneous intrusion
within
Earth's crust.
It is located in
northern South Africa
, exposed at the edge of the Transvaal Basin.
It covers a pear-shaped area of over 66,000
sq.km
The complex varies in thickness, sometimes reaching 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) thick.
It is renowned for containing
some of the richest ore deposits.
The complex contains the
world's largest reserves of platinum-group metals
(PGMs), i.e., platinum, palladium, osmium, iridium, rhodium, and ruthenium, along with
vast quantities of iron, tin, chromium
, titanium, and vanadium.
BIC is divided into an eastern and western lobe, with a further northern extension. All three sections of the system were
formed around
the same time, about
2 billion years ago.
Formation
Vast quantities of
molten rock from
Earth's mantle
brought to the surface
through long vertical cracks
in the Earth's crust, creating the geological intrusion known as the BIC.
effects of these injections
of molten rock
over time,
combined with
crystallisation of different minerals
at different temperatures, resulted in the formation of a structure rather like a layered cake consisting of
distinct rock strata

**********The Impact of Climate Change on Poor Farmers in India: FAO Report
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article, About FAO)
Key Highlights of the FAO’s Report (Key Findings, NITI Aayog’s Response, etc.)
Background:
A recent report from the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
highlights how
climate change
disproportionately affects
poorer farmers in India
Titled
“The Unjust Climate: Measuring the Impacts of Climate Change on Rural Poor, Women, and Youth,”
the report reveals the vulnerabilities faced by marginalized farming communities due to climate-induced stresses such as
heat stress
floods
droughts
About Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO):
It is a specialized agency of the
United Nations
that leads international efforts to defeat hunger, improve nutrition, and ensure food security.
Its primary mission is to raise levels of nutrition, improve agricultural productivity, and better the lives of rural populations by promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
Established in
1945
, FAO's headquarters is located in
Rome, Italy
Key Objectives of FAO:
Eradicating Hunger and Food Insecurity
FAO works towards achieving a world free of hunger, ensuring that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food.
Sustainable Agriculture
The organization promotes the adoption of sustainable agricultural methods to increase productivity while preserving natural resources like soil, water, and biodiversity.
Improving Rural Livelihoods
FAO supports smallholder farmers, rural communities, and women by providing tools, knowledge, and access to markets to improve their economic opportunities.
Tackling Climate Change
The FAO is actively involved in addressing the impacts of
on food systems and advocating for climate-resilient farming practices.
Key Highlights of the Report:
The FAO, recently, presented the report “The unjust climate. Measuring the impacts of climate change on rural poor, women, and youth” at an event in New Delhi.
Key Findings of the Report:
Income Disparities
The report finds that
poor households
globally lose
5% of their income
annually due to heat stress and
4.4%
due to floods, compared to wealthier households.
In India, rural poor households are particularly vulnerable because their income sources are more reliant on
climate-sensitive agriculture
Structural Inequalities:
According to the report, the vulnerability of poor farmers is deeply rooted in
structural inequalities
Households exposed to climate stressors experience a more significant reduction in total income compared to those unaffected.
Poor farmers dedicate more resources to sustaining agricultural production during adverse events, leading to reduced opportunities for
off-farm employment
Impact of Heat Stress and Floods
The report states that climate change widens the income gap between poor and non-poor households globally.
Floods increase this gap by approximately
$21 billion per year
, while heat stress contributes to a gap of over
$20 billion
In India, rising temperatures increase the dependency of poor households on farming, while off-farm incomes decrease by
33%
Policy Recommendations
The FAO report suggests expanding
social security nets
for vulnerable communities.
Anticipatory social protection programs
, which provide livelihood support ahead of extreme weather events, can help reduce poverty and reliance on harmful coping strategies.
The report also recommends addressing
gendered barriers
in employment, promoting
workforce diversification
, and providing
mentorship programs
to help rural communities participate in the modern workforce.
The report emphasizes the need to empower
in rural areas to help combat the effects of climate change.
Gender-transformative approaches
are necessary to challenge discriminatory social norms and enable women to make economic decisions that directly affect their lives.
The report suggests
and initiatives to strengthen socio-emotional skills, allowing women and youth to better participate in the workforce and adapt to modern employment needs.
NITI Aayog’s Response:
Responding to the report, a member of
, said that India has been actively addressing the challenges posed by climate change. Key initiatives include:
National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA)
This project was implemented to help Indian farmers adapt to extreme weather conditions.
NICRA offers solutions for various crops, ensuring that farmers are equipped to handle adverse climatic events.
Employment Guarantee Schemes and Social Safety Nets
India was the first country to implement an
employment guarantee scheme
(Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) to provide economic security to its population.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government distributed
free food grains
(Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana) to two-thirds of the population, demonstrating its commitment to addressing both climate-related and economic challenges.
Increasing Women’s Participation
Recent data from the
Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS)
shows a significant increase in women’s participation in the workforce, indicating progress toward gender equality in employment opportunities.

**********Union Government Announces MSP Hike for Rabi Crops
Why in News?
The Union government has declared minimum support prices (MSP) for six rabi crops for the 2025-26 marketing season, notably increasing the MSP for wheat by ₹150 per quintal to ₹2,425, marking a 6.59% rise from the previous MSP.
What’s in today’s article?
MSP Regime in India
Issues Faced by the MSP Regime in India
News Summary Regarding MSP Hike for Rabi Crops
Minimum Support Price (MSP) Regime in India:
About MSP:
MSP is a form of
market intervention
(a policy decision not enforceable by law) by the Government of India to insure agricultural producers against any sharp fall in farm prices during bumper production years.
Announced by:
These are announced by the
Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
(Chaired by the PM of India) on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (
CACP
) at the beginning of the sowing season for certain crops.
Objectives:
MSPs are a guarantee price
for farmer’s produce from the Government to prevent the farmers from distress sales and to procure food grains for public distribution.
For example,
if the market price for a commodity falls below the specified minimum price due to market surplus, government agencies will buy the entire quantity supplied by farmers at the announced minimum price.
The MSP hikes are
essential not only for farmers' welfare but also for stabilising agricultural markets
, especially as India aims to enhance domestic pulse production amid rising imports.
Background:
India's agriculture was
devastated under British rule
and the farmers were impoverished.
The Food-Grain Enquiry Committee
, established by the Jawaharlal Nehru administration in 1957, was the first attempt to address the agricultural earning issue.
In 1964,
Lal Bahadur Shastri
formed the Food Grain Price Committee (under LK Jha), to push for a MSP regime.
The first MSP announcement
was made in 1967 by the then Agriculture Minister Jagjivan Ram.
Thus, the MSP regime came into existence as
(to be applicable uniformly across India) and the government set up the Agricultural Prices Commission (renamed as the CACP in 1985) for fixing MSP for crops.
Crops covered
Government announces MSPs for
22
mandated crops and fair and remunerative price (FRP) for
sugarcane
(total 23).
The mandated crops are
14
crops of the
kharif
6 rabi crops
(Wheat, Barley, Gram, Masur [Lentil], Rapeseed & Mustard, Safflower) and two other commercial crops.
Issues Faced by the MSP Regime in India:
Limited coverage:
MSP is only applicable to certain crops, primarily those included in the government procurement system. Many farmers grow crops not covered by MSP, leaving them vulnerable to price fluctuations.
Regional disparities:
The implementation of MSP varies across states. Some regions benefit more due to better procurement infrastructure, while others face challenges in accessing MSP, leading to uneven support for farmers.
Discourage diversification:
Farmers may become overly reliant on MSP, which can discourage diversification and lead to overproduction of specific crops, causing market imbalances.
Procurement challenges:
While MSP aims to ensure fair pricing, actual procurement processes can be inefficient. Issues like delays in payments, inadequate storage facilities, and corruption can hinder farmers from benefiting fully.
Market distortions:
MSP can distort market signals by encouraging farmers to produce crops primarily for government support rather than responding to market demand, potentially leading to surpluses and wastage.
Neglect of non-cereal crops:
The MSP regime has historically focused on staple crops like wheat and rice, often neglecting pulses, oilseeds, and other essential crops.
This can impact nutritional diversity and food security.
Inflationary pressure:
Increasing MSP without corresponding productivity improvements can contribute to inflation in food prices, affecting consumers and the overall economy.
Sustainability concerns:
The emphasis on certain crops may lead to unsustainable farming practices, such as excessive water use and soil degradation, affecting long-term agricultural viability.
Underutilisation of available support:
Many farmers are not fully aware of the MSP policies or how to access them, leading to underutilisation of available support.
Political interference:
MSP decisions can be influenced by political considerations, leading to inconsistencies in pricing and procurement policies that do not necessarily align with economic realities.
News Summary Regarding MSP Hike for Rabi Crops:
Details of MSP adjustments:
Government’s justification:
Despite upcoming elections in states like Maharashtra and Jharkhand, the government
denied any political motives
behind the timing of these announcements.
According to the Union Agriculture Minister, these hikes will
ensure fair prices to farmers and encourage crop diversification
The decision to increase the MSP for mandated Rabi Crops for the Marketing Season 2025-26 aligns with the
Union Budget 2018-19
announcement of fixing the MSP
at a level of at least 1.5 times of the All-India weighted average cost of production
The anticipated margin over the All-India weighted average cost of production varies among crops, with
wheat leading at 105%,
followed by rapeseed & mustard at 98%, lentil at 89%, gram and barley both at 60%, and safflower at 50%.
Significance of wheat crop:
Wheat is India’s 2nd-largest crop
, with a production estimate of 113.92 million tonnes for 2023-24.
UP, MP, and Punjab
are the leading wheat-producing states.
In the current marketing season, the government has procured 26.6 million tonnes of wheat, benefiting approximately 22 lakh farmers.

**********Satcom Spectrum To Be Allocated Administratively
Why in news?
Speaking on the sidelines of the India Mobile Congress, Telecom minister said that satcom spectrum will be allocated administratively but will come at a cost.
As per the announcement, the cost of spectrum and the formula of allocation will be decided by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).
What’s in today’s article?
Airwaves/Spectrum
Satellite spectrum
Auction vs administrative allocation of spectrum
Satellite spectrum to be allocated administratively in India
Spectrum allocation controversies in India
Airwaves are radio frequencies within the electromagnetic spectrum that can carry information wirelessly for a range of services including telecommunications.
The government manages and allocates airwaves to companies or sectors for their use.
The government auctions a fixed amount of spectrum within specified band/s to be utilised by operators for providing communication services to consumers.
About
Satellite spectrum refers to the r
ange of radio frequencies used by satellites to communicate with ground stations
, other satellites, and various devices on Earth.
These frequencies are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically the radio waves, and are allocated for different satellite services, such as communication, broadcasting, navigation, and Earth observation.
Regulation
The use of satellite spectrum is regulated by international bodies like the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
ITU coordinates and allocates frequencies to prevent interference between different satellite systems and other forms of communication.
Satellite Frequency Bands
L-band
(1-2 GHz): Used for GPS and mobile satellite services.
S-band
(2-4 GHz): Used for weather radar, air traffic control, and mobile satellite services.
C-band
(4-8 GHz): Commonly used for satellite TV broadcasting and data communications.
X-band
(8-12 GHz): Used primarily by the military for radar and communication.
Ku-band
(12-18 GHz) and
Ka-band
(26-40 GHz): Used for satellite television, internet, and high-throughput data transmission.
Auctions involve competitive bidding, where spectrum licenses are sold to the highest bidder, promoting efficient resource allocation and generating revenue for the government.
This method ensures transparency, reducing the chances of favoritism or corruption, and is commonly used in commercial telecommunications for optimal spectrum usage.
Auctions are preferred in competitive markets where multiple entities compete for access.
Administrative allocation
Administrative allocation involves the government directly assigning spectrum licenses without a bidding process, often for a nominal fee covering administrative costs.
This method is used when auctions are impractical, offering flexibility for sectors like national security, public services, or emerging industries like satellite communications.
It is suitable for areas with low competition or where frequency sharing among users is feasible, ensuring easier access to resources for specialized or government-related services.
Key differences between auction and administrative allocation
The auction method is competitive, market-driven, and generates significant revenue, ensuring transparency by allocating spectrum to the highest bidder, making it ideal for commercial markets.
In contrast, administrative allocation is a direct government assignment with lower fees, offering flexibility but less transparency, suited for government services or specialized sectors.
Both methods are essential in spectrum management, with the choice depending on regulatory goals and market needs.
About the news
The government has chosen to allocate satellite communication (satcom) spectrum through administrative means, rejecting the auction route.
This development underscores the growing competition for satellite services in the Indian market, which is
projected to grow at 36 per cent annually and reach $1.9 billion by 2030
Starlink, Musk’s company, advocates for direct licensing, aligning with global practices and arguing that spectrum, as a natural resource, should be shared.
On the other hand, Reliance, led by Ambani, believes that an auction is necessary to ensure fair competition.
Rationale behind India’s stand
Unlike terrestrial spectrum which is used for mobile communications,
satellite spectrum has no national territorial limits and is international in character
Satellite spectrum is shared spectrum. If the spectrum is shared, then it cannot be priced individually.
As a result, satellite spectrum across the world is allocated administratively.
India, being a signatory of ITU, decided to follow the global practice of allocating satellite spectrum administratively.
The Telecommunications Act, 2023
, had also added
spectrum for satellite communication in the list of administrative allocation
India’s spectrum allocation has been controversial, especially due to the shift from auctions to administrative assignments,
highlighted by the 2G spectrum scam
The scam involved allocating licenses on a first-come, first-served basis, resulting in significant financial losses, with alleged damages of Rs 30,984 crore and a presumptive loss of Rs 1.76 trillion.
Following this, the
Supreme Court mandated auctions for spectrum allocation in 2012
Despite this, the Telecommunications Act 2023 introduced a non-auction route for allocating satellite spectrum, marking a shift in the regulatory approach.
