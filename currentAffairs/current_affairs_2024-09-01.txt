What does Spaceflight do to the Human Body?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
About Space (Meaning, Effects on Human Body, Counter Measures, etc.)
Background:
On August 24, NASA announced that Boeing's Starliner crew capsule, which had transported astronauts
Sunita Williams
and
Barry Wilmore
to the International Space Station (ISS) for its first crewed test flight, was deemed unsafe for their return journey.
As a result, NASA has extended Williams and Wilmore's stay on the ISS until February 2025.
They are scheduled to return aboard a SpaceX crew capsule, set to launch in September 2024.
Meanwhile, Boeing's Starliner will undock and return to Earth without any crew on board.
Understanding Space & Microgravity:
Space is defined by its conditions, which differ vastly from Earth.
Space begins at the
Karman line
, 100 km above sea level, where gravity significantly weakens but does not disappear.
This microgravity environment affects various bodily functions, leading to several health issues for astronauts.
Effects on Human Body:
Bones
: In microgravity, bones weaken due to the lack of weight-bearing activities, which may cause the body to deposit excess minerals in the kidneys, leading to kidney stones.
Digestion
: The digestive system slows down, potentially leading to weight gain.
Eyes
: Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) is a condition affecting eyesight, caused by fluid accumulation in the head.
Heart and Muscles
: The heart may shrink due to reduced workload, and muscle mass can decrease, leading to overall weakness.
Blood and Brain
: The body loses more red blood cells, requiring dietary adjustments. The brain works harder to maintain balance and orientation due to altered signals from the body in microgravity.
How Does Astronauts Counter These Effects?
Countermeasures and Research
Space agencies have implemented strict exercise regimes and predictable routines to help mitigate these effects.
Researchers are also exploring the impact of different nutrients and drugs in space, as well as developing new technologies and protocols to monitor and manage health issues.
Japan’s
KAKENHI programme
is studying biological responses to various parts of the space environment.
Europe’s
Space Omics
Topical Team is developing space omics tools and methods.
In the U.S., the ‘Complement of Integrated Protocols for Human Exploration Research’ project allows astronauts to sign up for experiments in space that will study their health in standardised ways.
Scientists from around the world, including India, are part of the
International Standards for Space Omics Processing
to develop research and ethics guidelines.
How Much Time are Humans Spending in Space?
Increase in Space Mission Duration
In the 1960s, astronauts spent an average of one month in space. By the 2020s, this has increased to six months.
Each expedition to the ISS now lasts up to six months
Evolution of Space Missions
Less than a century ago, going to the moon was considered a long-duration space mission.
Today, space agencies from various countries, including China, India, Japan, Russia, and the U.S., are planning permanent stations on the moon and human missions to Mars.
These new long-duration missions will introduce new safety challenges.
Records in Space:
11 individuals have spent more than 300 days in space on a single mission.
The record for the longest single mission is held by Russia’s Valeri Polyakov with 437 days.
The American record is held by Frank Rubio with 370 days.
Oleg Kononenko is the only astronaut to have spent more than 1,000 days in space across multiple missions
Peggy Whitson, a U.S. astronaut, has spent 675 days in space, making her the second active spacefarer on this list.
If Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore’s current trip ends on February 15, 2025, they will have spent 256 days in orbit

**********India has a special China problem above world’s general China problem
Why in news?
While addressing a forum, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar flagged that India has a “special China problem” which is over and above the world’s “general China problem”. In this context, he said that the border and the state of relations with the country call for investments from China to be scrutinised.
What’s in today’s article?
India – China Border Dispute
Border Roads Organisation (BRO) Infrastructure Projects on India-China Border
Key highlights of the speech delivered by EAM
Western Sector (Disputed sector) –
This comprises the Aksai Chin sector. A region that originally was a part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir is claimed by China as part of its autonomous Xinjiang region.
After the 1962 war, it is administered by China. It is the second largest Indo-China border area covering over 38000 sq. km. However, it is an uninhabited land.
While India claims the entire
Aksai Chin territory
as well as the
Shaksgam valley
(Indian territory gifted to China by Pakistan), China contests Indian control over Daulat Beg Oldi (a tehsil in Leh, south of Aksai China - it is believed to host the world’s highest airstrip).
Central Sector
The 625 km boundary of this sector is least controversial between two nations.
There is no major disagreement over boundary in this region between two countries.
Border Dispute in Eastern Sector: McMahon Line
The disputed boundary in the Eastern Sector of the India-China border is over the McMahon Line.
Representatives of China, India and Tibet in 1913-14 met in Shimla to settle the boundary between Tibet and India, and Tibet and China
During the Shimla conference, Sir Henry McMahon, the then foreign secretary of British India, drew up the 890 km McMahon Line as the border between British India and Tibet.
The McMahon line moved British control substantially northwards
. This agreement ceded Tawang and other Tibetan areas to the imperial British Empire.
Though the Chinese representatives at the meeting initialled the agreement, they subsequently refused to accept it.
Subsequently, the Chinese government stated that it does not recognize the "illegal" McMahon Line.
China accuses India of occupying areas in Arunachal, which it calls part of Southern Tibet
The Arunachal Pradesh border, that China claims to be its own territory, is the largest disputed area, covering around 90000 sq. km.
During the 1962 war, the People’s Liberation Army occupied it but they announced a unilateral ceasefire and withdrew respecting the McMahon Line.
BRO Infrastructure Projects on India-China Border
Road Infrastructure Completion:
The BRO is nearing completion of specific road patches on an alternate route to Leh, ensuring all-weather connectivity.
Key projects include connecting the Nimu-Padam-Darcha road and beginning work on the Shinku La tunnel, which will be the world’s highest tunnel at 15,800 feet.
Leh Connectivity:
There are currently three routes to Leh: via
Srinagar-ZojiLa-Kargil, Manali-Rohtang, and the new Nimu-Padam-Darcha road
The Shinku La tunnel will significantly reduce the distance between Manali and Leh by 60 km, offering a third all-weather route.
Ladakh Border Roads:
The BRO prioritizes establishing connectivity to roads parallel to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, including the Leh-Demchok road and routes connecting Durbuk to Nyoma via Chushul.
ICBR Programme:
Under the India-China Border Roads (ICBR) programme, the BRO is focusing on completing strategic roads in Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh, with a total of 73 strategic roads planned under the first two phases.
Arunachal Pradesh Frontier Highway:
A major project involves constructing a nearly 1,800-km frontier highway in Arunachal Pradesh, connecting various key locations close to the Myanmar border.
Other Key Projects:
The Sungal tunnel on the Akhnoor-Poonch National Highway and the Lipulekh Pass Road on the Mansarovar Yatra route are also priority projects for the BRO.
Increased Focus Since 2020:
Since 2020, there has been a significant acceleration in border infrastructure development in Ladakh and the Northeast, with increased budget allocations reflecting the importance of these projects for national security.
"Special China Problem" for India:
India faces a unique set of challenges with China, distinct from the broader global concerns regarding China's rise.
EAM emphasized that India's "special China problem" goes beyond the "general China problem" faced by other countries like the United States and those in Europe.
Scrutiny of Chinese Investments:
Given the strained border relations, India is justified in scrutinizing investments from China.
Even countries without a border with China, such as the U.S. and European nations, are scrutinizing Chinese investments due to security concerns.
Border Situation and Diplomatic Progress:
Recent talks between India and China showed some diplomatic progress in resolving the border standoff, which began in May 2020.
The phrase "narrow down the differences," used for the first time in these talks, indicates a positive development in negotiations.
Trade Deficit and China's Unique Position:
Jaishankar discussed the trade deficit with China, attributing it to China's unique production advantages that India and others failed to account for in the past.
He stressed the need to understand China's unique political and economic system to formulate effective policies.
Intersection of Economics and Security:
The line between economics and national security is increasingly blurred, especially in the context of countries like China.
National security now extends to areas like telecommunications, where reliance on Chinese technology could pose risks
Ongoing Border Standoff
The border standoff between India and China has persisted for over four years, with significant troop deployments on both sides along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.
While some friction points have been resolved, legacy issues in areas like Depsang Plains and Demchok remain.

**********Efforts to Boost Ethanol Production in India
Why in News?
The Department of Biotechnology is considering establishing enzyme-manufacturing facilities to support ethanol production.
This comes after the Center's announcement of its BioE3 (Biotechnology for Economy, Environment and Employment) policy aimed at promoting biotechnology-centric manufacturing in India.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is BioE3 Policy for Fostering High Performance Biomanufacturing?
Ethanol Requirements in India
Significance of Establishing Enzyme-Manufacturing Facilities in India
What is high-performance biomanufacturing?
It involves -
The production of products ranging from medicine to materials, tackling farming and food challenges, and
Promoting the manufacturing of bio-based products through the integration of advanced biotechnological processes.
Focus areas of the policy:
It primarily concentrates on the following
6 strategic sectors
High-value bio-based chemicals, biopolymers & enzymes;
Smart proteins & functional foods;
Precision biotherapeutics;
Climate-resilient agriculture;
Carbon capture & its utilisation; and
Marine and space research.
Key features of the policy:
The BioE3 policy's key aspects involve -
Supporting i
nnovation-driven R&D and entrepreneurship
across various thematic sectors.
Expedite the development and commercialisation of technology through the establishment of Biomanufacturing & Bio-AI hubs and Biofoundry.
Bolster the Government's initiatives such as
'Net Zero'
carbon economy and
'Lifestyle for Environment'.
Guiding India towards accelerated
'Green Growth'
by encouraging
'Circular Bioeconomy
Nurture an advanced future that is more sustainable, innovative, and responsive to global challenges and sets out the
Bio-vision for Viksit Bharat
Significance:
It will address some of the critical societal issues-such as
climate change mitigation, food security and human health.
It is important to build
a resilient biomanufacturing ecosystem
in India to accelerate cutting-edge innovations for developing bio-based products.
Ethanol Requirements in India:
According to the NITI Ayog estimates, India will need about
13.5 billion litres of ethanol annually
by 2025–26.
Of this, about 10.16 billion litres will go towards meeting the fuel-blending mandate of
E20
The Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme
was launched by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas in
Under this, Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) would sell petrol blended with ethanol up to
10% (E10).
The all-India average blending of ethanol with petrol has risen from 1.6% in 2013-14 to
11.8% in 2022-23
India's goal is to grow this ratio to 20% (E20) by 2025.
Efforts to Boost Ethanol Production in India:
2G ethanol plant in Panipat, Haryana:
‘2G’ or second-generation
bioethanol is ethanol that is produced from rice-straw as opposed to the conventional method of sourcing it from molasses (sugarcane).
In 2022, the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. set up a first-of-its-kind 2G ethanol plant in Panipat that uses rice stubble as a feedstock.
The facility has the potential to produce 1,00,000 litres of ethanol per day.
However, the burning of rice stubble spikes pollution in north India.
The BioE3 policy:
Among other things, it aims to set up ‘bio-foundries’ that will produce biotechnology-developed feedstock and catalysts.
Establishing enzyme-manufacturing facilities:
The enzymes in question are derived from tweaking a fungus (through several steps of genetic engineering) that belongs to a broader family of fungi called Penicillium funiculosum (derived from rice stubble and soil).
Such enzymes then act as an efficient hydrolyser of organic refuse such as rice stubble.
The first such plant
to produce the necessary enzymes may come up in Manesar, Haryana.
It is expected to provide the required enzymes to the existing plant in Panipat (Haryana) and the proposed 2G bioethanol plants in Mathura (UP) and Bhatinda (Punjab).
Significance of Establishing Enzyme-Manufacturing Facilities in India:
Support ethanol production:
A combination of enzymes and the right kind of treatment are essential for turning stubble into ethanol.
Reduce import bill and cost of ethanol production:
As of today, these enzymes are imported and constitute a significant component of the cost of the 2G-ethanol production process.
If India's ethanol requirements in the future were to be met by locally produced enzymes,
the cost of obtaining the enzymes might be reduced by about two third.

**********National Conference of the District Judiciary
Why in news?
PM Modi inaugurated the National Conference of District Judiciary on 31st August, 2024 at Bharat Mandapam in New Delhi. On the occasion, Prime Minister also unveiled the
stamp and coin commemorating 75 years of the establishment of the Supreme Court of India
The two-day Conference is being
organised by the Supreme Court of India
. It will host five working sessions that will deliberate and discuss on the issues related to District Judiciary such as Infrastructure and Human Resources, Inclusive Courtrooms for all, Judicial Security and Judicial Wellness, Case Management and Judicial Training.
What’s in today’s article?
Modern Judiciary in India
Key highlights of the speech delivered by PM Modi
Key highlights of the speech delivered by CJI
Evolution
Introduction of Judicial System
: The British colonial administration introduced a judicial system in India based on Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.
Royal Charter of 1661
: The Royal Charter of Charles II (1661) empowered the Governor and Council to adjudicate civil and criminal cases according to the laws of England.
Regulating Act of 1773
: This act established the Supreme Court of India in Calcutta, with a Chief Justice and three judges (later reduced to two) appointed by the Crown. It acted as the King's court, not as the East India Company's court.
Supreme Courts in Madras and Bombay
: Later, Supreme Courts were also established in Madras and Bombay, holding jurisdiction over "His Majesty's subjects."
Dual Judicial Systems
: During this period, the judicial system had two distinct systems of courts:
English System of Royal Courts
: Followed English law and procedure in the presidencies.
Indian System of Adalat/Sadr Courts
: Followed Regulation laws and Personal laws in the provinces.
High Court Act of 1861
: This act merged the two systems, replacing the Supreme Courts and native courts (Sadr Dewani Adalat and Sadr Nizamat Adalat) in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras with High Courts.
Highest Court of Appeal
: The highest court of appeal was the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
Development of Unified Court System
: The British made efforts to develop the Indian legal system into a unified court system.
Indian Laws and Courts
: Indians had neither their own laws nor courts; both were designed to meet the needs of the colonial power.
Government of India Act of 1935 (Section 200)
: This act set up the Federal Court of India as an intermediate appellate body between High Courts and the Privy Council, especially for interpreting the Indian Constitution.
Limited Power of Federal Court
: The Federal Court could only issue declaratory judgments, meaning it could declare the law but had no authority to enforce compliance.
Judicial Review
: The Federal Court's power of 'judicial review' was largely symbolic, with very limited practical power.
Federal Court's Continuation
: Despite its limitations, the Federal Court continued to function until 26th January 1950, when independent India's Constitution came into force.
Structure – three-tier division
The Judicial system however has a unified structure.
The court structure is set as per the judiciary system prevailing in India with differentiation of applicability as per the merit of the case.
The normal trend of the judiciary system is to start any general dispute in the lower court which is being escalated as per the satisfaction of the parties to the higher courts.
Applicability (jurisdiction)can be determined on: Pecuniary; Territorial; Subject matter.
Importance of the Supreme Court's Journey
PM Modi emphasized that the 75-year journey of the Supreme Court is not just about an institution but reflects the evolution of the Indian Constitution and the maturing of Bharat as a democracy.
He highlighted the contributions of Constitution makers, eminent personalities of the judiciary, and the unwavering faith of citizens in the judiciary.
Role of the Judiciary in Safeguarding Democracy
The judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, is recognized as the custodian of the Constitution.
Efforts to Modernize the Judiciary
PM Modi discussed the government's efforts over the past decade to modernize the judiciary and make justice more accessible.
He mentioned the significant investment in judicial infrastructure, noting that a substantial portion of this expenditure has occurred in the last 10 years.
Technological Advancements in the Judiciary
introduction and expansion of e-Courts
have accelerated judicial processes and reduced burdens on legal practitioners and litigants.
The government is moving towards a unified technology platform for the judiciary, incorporating emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Optical Character Recognition.
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Legal Reforms
PM Modi highlighted the new Indian legal code, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, which focuses on 'Citizen First, Dignity First, and Justice First.'
He pointed out that these reforms have removed colonial-era laws, introduced strict measures against crimes, and recognized electronic and digital records as evidence.
Emphasis on Women and Child Safety
The safety of women and children is a serious concern, and strict laws have been enacted to address these issues.
Fast-track special courts and District Monitoring Committees play a crucial role in ensuring swift justice in cases of atrocities against women.
Vision for a Developed and New India
The judiciary, particularly the District Judiciary, is seen as a strong pillar of the vision for a developed and modern Bharat.
PM Modi expressed confidence that the conference discussions would help in meeting the expectations of the nation and contribute to the realization of 'Viksit Bharat' (Developed India) and 'Naya Bharat' (New India).
Key Highlights of Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud's Speech
Promotion of Legal Education in Regional Languages
To make legal knowledge accessible to citizens in the language they understand.
He expressed hope that legal education in regional languages would produce new bands of lawyers well-equipped to argue in their mother tongues.
District Judiciary as the "Backbone of the Judiciary"
He advocated for ending the practice of referring to the district judiciary as "subordinate judiciary," calling it a relic of the colonial era that should be discarded 75 years after Independence.
Challenges Faced by the District Judiciary
The district judiciary is facing challenges such as citizens' inability to afford legal representation, lack of awareness about statutory rights, and geographical difficulties in accessing courts.
Adoption of Technology in the Judiciary
The CJI highlighted significant advancements in the adoption of technology within the judiciary, including the digitization of court records, the functioning of e-sewa kendras, and the use of video conferencing for case hearings.
He emphasized that technology should be fully utilized to ensure that courts remain citizen-centric and accessible to all.
Increasing Participation of Women in the Judiciary
He noted the increasing number of women joining the district judiciary, highlighting that in states like Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala, women have made up a significant percentage of recent judicial appointments.
He pointed to this trend as a sign of a promising future for the judiciary, with a young and technologically savvy demographic.
Translation of Supreme Court Judgments
The CJI mentioned that
Supreme Court judgments are being translated into all languages recognized by the Constitution, with 73,000 translated judgments already available to the public
