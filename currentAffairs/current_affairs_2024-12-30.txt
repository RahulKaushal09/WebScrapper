Key takeaways
A Western Disturbance (WD) is an extra-tropical storm originating in the Mediterranean region, characterized by its movement from west to east. It is carried towards South Asia by the subtropical westerly jet stream.
Formation and Origin:
Formed over the Mediterranean Sea, Caspian Sea, or Black Sea.
Develops as low-pressure systems with associated upper-air cyclonic circulations.
Movement: Moves eastwards, influenced by the jet stream, entering India through the northwestern regions.
Seasonality: Primarily active during winter (November to March) but can occasionally occur in other seasons.
Regions Affected:
Northwestern India: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Western Uttar Pradesh.
Extends to the Himalayan states: Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu & Kashmir.
Sometimes influences central and eastern India.
Weather Impact:
Rainfall and Snowfall:
Causes winter rainfall in the northwestern plains.
Triggers snowfall in the Himalayan regions, critical for replenishing glaciers and water reserves.
Temperature Effects:
Leads to a decrease in daytime temperatures (due to cloud cover and rain).
Increases nighttime temperatures (acts as a blanket by trapping terrestrial radiation).
Agricultural Significance: Beneficial for Rabi crops like wheat and mustard due to moisture availability.
Disruptive Effects: Can lead to flash floods, landslides, and avalanches in mountainous regions.
Interaction with Local Systems: When WDs interact with moist easterly winds (originating from the Bay of Bengal), they intensify, leading to widespread precipitation.

PANGOLINS
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
Recent incidents in Telangana have renewed concerns about the smuggling of pangolins, a scaly nocturnal mammal known for its huge demand in the international market. This has prompted renewed vigilance against its illicit trafficking.
The creatures are strictly nocturnal, repelling predators by curling up into scaly spheres upon being alarmed. The same defence mechanism however, makes them slow and easy to catch once spotted.
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-200858 aligncenter" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="211" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/30-dec-2-300x211.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/30-dec-2-300x211.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/30-dec-2.png 605w" width="300"/>
Globally there are eight pangolin species, four each in Africa and Asia. India is home to two species – Indian pangolin Manis crassicaudata and Chinese pangolin Manis pentadactyla.
Indian pangolins are found in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
In India, the species (Indian pangolin) is widely distributed and has been recorded in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.
In India, both Indian pangolins and Chinese pangolins are listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, of 1972. Therefore hunting, trade, or any other form of utilisation of the species or their body parts and derivatives is banned.
Since 2017, all pangolin species have been listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), prohibiting their commercial trade.
Chinese Pangolin is classified as ‘Critically Endangered’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List while the Indian Pangolin is classified as ‘Endangered’ on the IUCN Red List.
They are the only known mammals with large keratin scales covering their skin. They are also toothless.
These animals are inherently shy and have minimal requirements for sustenance. Their diet primarily consists of ants, termites, and their eggs and larvae. Their sense of smell is extraordinary but vision and hearing are poor.
Pangolins are the most trafficked mammal in the world—with demand primarily in Asia and in growing amounts in Africa—for their meat and scales. There is also demand in the United States for pangolin products, particularly for their leather to be used in boots, bags, and belts.
Significance of Pangolins
Pangolins are “ecosystem engineers” that build burrows that help circulate soil organic matter, increase soil moisture and aeration, and affect plant community succession through their burying behaviour.
The burrows made by pangolins also get utilised as shelters by other species within their ecosystem.

SIANG UPPER MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT (SUMP)
A sense of unease prevails in two districts along the Siang River in Arunachal Pradesh, as protests intensify against the proposed Siang Upper Multipurpose Project (SUMP).
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-200859 aligncenter" decoding="async" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/30-dec-3-244x300.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/30-dec-3-244x300.png 244w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/30-dec-3.png 317w" width="244"/>
The government asserts that SUMP is not merely another hydropower initiative but a measure to save the river by mitigating the impacts of China’s dam-building activities upstream in Tibet. According to reports, China has approved the construction of world’s largest hydropower dam on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau near Arunachal Pradesh.
The Siang originates near Mount Kailash in Tibet, where it is known as the Yarlung Tsangpo. It traverses over 1,000 km eastward before forming a horseshoe bend around the Namcha Barwa peak and entering Arunachal Pradesh as the Siang.
Further downstream, in Assam, it joins tributaries like the Dibang and Lohit to become the Brahmaputra.
SUMP has faced opposition since it was first proposed by the NITI Aayog in 2017.
While the precise scale of the project will only be ascertained after feasibility surveys, a preliminary report submitted by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) in December 2022 to the Central Electrical Authority was for an 11,000-MW project with a reservoir capacity of 9 billion cubic metres.
This makes the project several times larger in scale than other projects currently in the works in the country.
The three sites earmarked for SUMP are Parong and Dite Dime in Siang district, and Ugeng in Upper Siang district.
The Adi tribe here revere the Siang as a provider, referring to it as Aane (mother) Siang. Cultivation on its banks was encouraged and facilitated by the state after Independence to move away from shifting cultivation in the hills. So while settled agriculture along the river is 60 years old among the farmers of this belt, they are now completely dependent on it.

**********Incidents on Loop, But It’s Escape for Regulator, Airlines
Context
The aviation industry in India has witnessed several safety lapses
, the most recent being the incident on December 5, 2024, involving an Air India Airbus A320 at Goa’s Mopa Airport.
The Hyderabad-bound aircraft mistakenly entered a parallel taxiway instead of the main runway,
leading to a rejected take-off. This event underscores a recurring issue in Indian aviation: runway confusion.
incident raises concerns about systemic failures in aviation safety oversight, pilot training, and accountability mechanisms, reflecting broader issues
within the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (
DGCA
) and airlines.
A History of Safety Lapses
India's aviation history is
rife with incidents of runway confusion.
From a Jet Airways flight mistakenly landing at an Indian Air Force base in 1993 to a SpiceJet aircraft landing on the wrong runway in 2008,
such errors highlight persistent safety deficiencies
More recent examples,
such as the Air India A320 landing on an under-construction runway in the Maldives (2018)
a SpiceJet aircraft's hard touchdown in Guwahati (2020),
illustrate a pattern of oversight failures.
Fortunately,
these incidents have not resulted in fatalities, but the potential for disaster is ever-present.
An Analysis of Systemic Accountability Deficit
Failure of the DGCA
As the primary regulatory body for civil aviation in India,
the DGCA bears the responsibility of ensuring compliance with safety standards.
However,
its track record reveals a consistent failure to address root causes of incidents. Instead of initiating comprehensive investigations
, the DGCA often attributes incidents to pilot error, conveniently absolving itself and airlines of accountability.
This approach violates the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)’s Annex 13
, which mandates thorough investigations into incidents and the implementation of corrective measures to prevent recurrence.
For example,
after runway confusion incidents in the past, such as the 2018 Air India A320 landing on an under-construction runway in the Maldives, the DGCA failed to enforce stricter pilot training
or infrastructure upgrades.
lack of meaningful action demonstrates the regulator's inability to learn from past mistakes,
leaving the aviation sector vulnerable to similar risks.
Ineffectiveness of Safety Audits
Safety audits conducted by the DGCA and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) are often superficial,
with significant deficiencies overlooked or underreported.
Many Indian airports fail to meet ICAO standards for runway infrastructure, lighting, and markings,
which are critical for pilot decision-making, especially during adverse conditions.
Despite these shortcomings
, audits seldom lead to corrective measures, perpetuating a cycle of negligence.
For instance,
the failure to address issues like inadequate runway markings and poor aerodrome design directly contributes to runway confusion
and other errors.
Yet, year after year,
these deficiencies persist, signalling a lack of enforcement and accountability.
Airlines’ Role in Safety Lapses
Airlines in India also bear significant responsibility for safety lapses
due to their cost-cutting measures and operational priorities.
Instead of investing in rigorous pilot training and enhanced safety protocols,
many airlines prioritise profitability and operational efficiency.
The emphasis on
on-time performance (OTP) further exacerbates the problem
, as pilots and crew are pressured to meet tight schedules, often at the expense of safety.
This pressure was evident in the Kozhikode (2020) and Mangaluru (2010) crashes
, where pilots’ decisions to land despite unsafe conditions were influenced by operational demands.
Despite these incidents,
airlines have continued to sideline safety concerns
, relying on the DGCA's lenient oversight to avoid accountability.
The Culture of Blame-Shifting
systemic accountability deficit is perpetuated by a pervasive culture of blame-shifting
, where pilots are often scapegoated for incidents.
This narrative deflects attention from broader systemic issues
, such as inadequate training programs, substandard infrastructure, and regulatory failures.
The aviation industry’s tendency to label incidents as pilot error not only undermines the credibility of investigations but also prevents meaningful reforms
from being implemented.
Moreover,
this culture discourages open reporting of safety concerns
Pilots and crew, fearing punitive action, may hesitate to highlight operational or regulatory shortcomings
, further eroding safety standards.
The Role of Poor Training and Infrastructure and Operational Pressures on Crew
Runway confusion incidents point to
glaring deficiencies in pilot training and aerodrome infrastructure.
Pilots’ lack of familiarity with runway markings
and failure to comply with stabilised approach criteria are
indicative of inadequate training programs.
India’s aviation infrastructure often fails to meet ICAO standards,
exacerbating safety risks.
Safety audits by the DGCA and the AAI have historically overlooked critical deficiencies, further compromising safety standards.
A significant contributor
to these incidents is the
operational pressure on flight crews.
India’s regulations on flight and duty time limitations are among the weakest globally,
allowing airlines to push pilots and cabin crew to their limits.
High-profile accidents like the
crashes exemplify the dangers of such pressures,
where pilots ignored co-pilot warnings in their haste to meet schedules.
Judiciary and Legislative Challenges and the Path Forward
India’s approach to aviation safety is
further undermined by judicial and legislative decisions that prioritise commercial interests over safety.
recent deferment of stricter flight and duty time limits under pressure from airlines reflects a disregard for crew fatigue
and its impact on safety.
Additionally,
judicial interventions, such as the High Court asking the DGCA to mediate between stakeholders
, highlight a lack of understanding of aviation safety’s non-negotiable nature.
The Path Forward
India must adopt a proactive and holistic approach
to address aviation safety challenges.
DGCA and airlines must be held accountable
for implementing robust training programs and complying with international safety standards.
Lessons can be drawn from Singapore’s example
, emphasising swift corrective actions and a culture of accountability.
urthermore, the judiciary and regulatory bodies must prioritise safety over commercial interests,
recognizing that crew fatigue and operational pressures are critical safety issues.
Conclusion
The December 2024 incident at Goa’s Mopa airport is not an isolated event
but a symptom of deeper systemic issues in Indian aviation.
Addressing these challenges requires a collective effort from regulators, airlines, and policymakers to create a culture of accountability, prioritise crew welfare
, and enhance safety standards.
As India’s aviation industry grows,
ensuring safety must remain paramount,
lest the nation continues to ‘cut a sorry figure’ in international aviation.

**********India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement marks two years of success
Why in news?
The India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (Ind-Aus ECTA) has successfully strengthened economic ties, boosting growth, MSMEs, businesses, and employment in both nations.
Entering its third year, the Indian government aims to sustain this momentum to achieve the Vision 2047 goal of making India a developed country.
What’s in today’s article?
Two Years of Ind-Aus ECTA
About
ECTA significantly reduces tariffs on over 90% of Australian goods exports to India.
From 29 December 2022, over 85% of Australian goods exports by value to India become tariff free, rising to 90% in six years.
Similarly, 96% of imports from India are now tariff free, rising to 100% by 2026.
ECTA is a stepping stone towards a full Australia-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).
Both India and Australia aim to build on ECTA's success, deepening economic integration to achieve a bilateral trade target of AUD 100 billion by 2030.
Background
In April 2022, India and Australia signed an ECTA that came into effect on December 29, 2022.
Significance of ECTA For India

**********Challenges of Holding Judges Accountable in India
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
Accountability of Judges (Legal Framework, Impeachment Process, Case Studies, Need for Reforms, etc.)
Introduction:
The accountability of judges in India, particularly in the higher judiciary, remains a contentious issue due to the complex mechanisms and significant immunity granted to them.
Recent events, such as controversial remarks by Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav of the Allahabad High Court, have reignited the debate on judicial accountability and the difficulties in addressing judicial misconduct effectively.
Accountability Mechanism for Judges:
The process for holding judges accountable is governed by the
Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968
, supported by Articles
124(4)
124(5)
217
, and
218
of the Indian Constitution.
Review Process
A judge can only be removed based on "
proved misbehaviour or incapacity
" as determined by a
three-member committee
comprising:
A Supreme Court judge
A Chief Justice of a High Court
An eminent jurist
Initiation of impeachment requires a motion in either the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, approved by the respective presiding officer.
Removal demands a
two-thirds majority
of members present and voting in both Houses of Parliament.
Case Studies Highlighting the Challenges:
Justice V. Ramaswamy (Supreme Court Judge)
Allegations
: Accused of financial impropriety, such as extravagant spending on his official residence and misusing public funds.
Outcome
A committee found him guilty, leading to the Chief Justice of India deciding not to allocate any work to him.
Despite this, the impeachment motion in the Lok Sabha failed in 1993 due to abstentions by the ruling Congress Party.
Justice Ramaswamy continued in office and retired with full benefits, highlighting the inadequacy of the impeachment process.
Justice Soumitra Sen (Calcutta High Court Judge)
: Misappropriation of ₹33.23 lakh as a court-appointed receiver and misrepresentation of facts.
Found guilty by a three-member committee.
Rajya Sabha voted for his removal, but he resigned before the motion could be tabled in the Lok Sabha.
His resignation underscored the challenge of ensuring accountability once a judge steps down.
Justice P.D. Dinakaran (Sikkim High Court Chief Justice)
: Accused of land grabbing and other serious misconduct.
Resigned on the day the three-member committee was to begin its proceedings.
His resignation effectively halted the investigation and highlighted the loophole wherein resignation can abort accountability mechanisms.
Need for Reforms:
Continue Investigations Post-Resignation
Resignation should not end an investigation, as it allows accused judges to evade accountability.
Legal reforms must ensure the continuation of proceedings to establish guilt or innocence, irrespective of resignation.
Independent Oversight
Establish a more robust framework to investigate allegations without requiring parliamentary approval at the initial stages.
Revisiting the Judges (Inquiry) Act
Amendments are needed to address procedural delays and reduce political interference in impeachment motions.
Conclusion:
The current framework for holding judges accountable in India is inadequate to address instances of judicial misconduct effectively.
High levels of immunity, coupled with procedural delays and loopholes, undermine public confidence in the judiciary.
Strengthening the legal mechanisms and ensuring continuity in accountability processes are essential to uphold judicial integrity and maintain trust in the rule of law.

**********Poor electoral participation of overseas Indian voters in Lok Sabha polls 2024
Why in news?
As per the data released by the Election Commission of India, ~1.2 lakh overseas Indians registered as voters for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, showing enthusiasm for electoral participation. However, only a small fraction actually voted.
What’s in today’s article?
Voting by overseas Indian voters
Participation of overseas Indian voters in Lok Sabha polls 2024
What is the current process of voting by NRIs/overseas Indian voters?
Currently, Election Commission of India (ECI) allows
NRIs to register as overseas electors
as long as they have not acquired the citizenship of another country.
An NRI can vote in the constituency in which his/her place of residence, as mentioned in the passport, is located.
He/she can only
vote in person
and will have to produce her passport in original at the polling station for establishing identity.
Voting rights for NRIs were introduced only in 2011
, through an amendment to the Representation of the People Act 1950.
As per the government,
total number of overseas voters
on January 1, 2023 stood at over 1.15 lakh.
In Lok Sabha elections of 2019, roughly 25,000 of them flew to India to vote.
Proxy voting proposal
In 2018, a bill to allow proxy voting for NRIs was passed in the Lok Sabha but stalled in the Rajya Sabha.
Postal Ballot Proposal
The EC, in 2020, had written to the Law Ministry proposing NRIs be allowed to vote through postal ballots.
For this, EC had proposed the extension of
Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot System (ETPBS)
facility to these voters.
ETPBS enables the voters to cast their vote on an electronically received postal ballot from their preferred location.
ETPBS facility is
so far available to service voters, including members of the armed forces and central armed police forces posted outside their home constituencies and members of Indian embassies and diplomatic missions
According to the EC proposal, any NRI interested in voting through postal ballot in an election will have to inform the Returning Officer (RO).
RO should be informed in a time period not later than five days after the notification of the election.
On receiving such information, the RO will dispatch the ballot paper electronically.
The NRI voters will download the ballot paper, mark their preference on the printout and send it back.
This ballot is to be sent back along with a declaration attested by an officer appointed by the consular representative of India in the country where the NRI is resident.
Enthusiasm in Registration but Poor Turnout
Overseas Indians showed significant enthusiasm in registering as electors, with 1,19,374 enrolling in the 2024 voter list, an increase from 99,844 in 2019.
However, only 2,958 flew to India to cast their votes, with Kerala contributing the majority (2,670).
State-Wise Voting Trends
: Highest participation with 2,670 voters out of 89,839 registered electors.
Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Bihar, Goa
: Zero turnout despite registrations.
Gujarat
: Only 2 out of 885 overseas electors voted.
Maharashtra
: Only 17 of the 5,097 electors participated.
Andhra Pradesh
: 195 out of 7,927 electors cast their votes.
Legal and Logistical Challenges
Registered NRI voters must travel to their constituencies in India to vote and show their original passports for identity verification.
High travel costs, employment obligations, and education are cited as barriers to participation.
Future Prospects
The Election Commission continues to receive appeals from the Indian diaspora for postal voting, highlighting the need for electoral reforms to address the low turnout among overseas electors.

**********The challenge of holding judges accountable
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to the Judiciary;
Why in the News?
Recently, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav’s speech at a Vishwa Hindu Parishad event, showing bias against Muslims, has raised concerns about the challenges in holding higher court judges accountable in India.
Why do the judges need to be accountable?
Upholding Judicial Integrity
: Judges are the guardians of the Constitution and are expected to exhibit the highest ethical standards to maintain public trust in the judiciary.
Safeguarding Democracy
: Accountability ensures that the judiciary acts as a fair and impartial arbiter, without overstepping or undermining democratic institutions.
Preventing Abuse of Power
: Judicial independence is vital, but unchecked power can lead to misconduct or corruption, as seen in cases like Justice V. Ramaswami and Justice Soumitra Sen.
Maintaining Public Confidence
: Accountability is critical to reinforcing public confidence in the judiciary, especially in a democracy where the judiciary acts as a check on other branches of government.
What are the accountable-related issues?
High Bar for Impeachment
: The process requires “proved misbehaviour or incapacity” and a two-thirds majority in Parliament, making it almost impossible to remove errant judges.
Resignation to Evade Accountability
: Judges like Justice Soumitra Sen and P.D. Dinakaran resigned before the completion of impeachment proceedings, avoiding scrutiny while retaining post-retirement benefits.
Immunity Misuse
: Judges continue to enjoy post-retirement benefits even after accusations of misconduct, as seen in Justice Ramaswami’s case, undermining accountability.
Limited Scope for Independent Oversight
: The judiciary lacks an independent review mechanism outside the Parliament-driven impeachment process, leaving little room for holding judges accountable in real time.
What is the review mechanism of committee set up under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968?
Initiation
: A removal motion, signed by 100 Lok Sabha MPs or 50 Rajya Sabha MPs, is submitted and approved by the Speaker or Chairman to initiate the process.
Investigation
: A three-member committee (Supreme Court judge, Chief Justice of a High Court, and an eminent jurist) is constituted under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 to investigate allegations of
“proved misbehaviour or incapacity.”
Parliamentary Decision
: If the committee confirms the charges, the motion is debated in Parliament and requires a two-thirds majority in both Houses for the judge’s removal by the President.
Is there any accountability limitation by the Constitution for the judges?
Article 124(4) and (5)
: These articles provide for the removal of judges only through impeachment, which is a political and cumbersome process requiring a majority in Parliament.
Lack of Disqualification
: The Constitution does not explicitly disqualify judges found guilty of misconduct from holding future public office.
Insufficient Deterrence
: Provisions under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, do not offer significant penalties
apart from removal,
leaving gaps in ensuring judicial accountability.
Ambiguity in “Proved Misbehavior”
: The term is not clearly defined, leading to challenges in establishing guilt and enforcing accountability.
Way forward:
Streamlining the Impeachment Process:
Simplifying procedures and reducing the threshold for initiating impeachment could make it easier to hold judges accountable.
Clear Disqualification Guidelines:
Introducing clear guidelines regarding disqualification from future judicial roles following findings of misconduct would reinforce accountability.
Public Awareness and Advocacy:
Increasing public awareness about judicial accountability issues can foster demand for reform and greater scrutiny of judicial conduct.
Legislative Reforms:
Revisiting the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, to address its limitations and ensure it meets contemporary standards for accountability is crucial for restoring public confidence in the judiciary.
Mains PYQ:
Critically examine the Supreme Court’s judgement on ‘National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014’ with reference to the appointment of judges of higher judiciary in India.
