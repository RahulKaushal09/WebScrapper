REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE (REER) SOARS TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
Context:
The rupee is hitting fresh lows against the US dollar each day, yet its exchange rate has scaled an all-time-high in “real effective” terms.
Background: –
Real effective exchange rate (REER) is a measure of a currency’s value against its trading partners, adjusted for inflation.
Key takeaways
The real effective exchange rate (REER) index of the rupee touched a record 108.14 in November, strengthening by 4.5 per cent during this calendar year, according to the latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data.
The REER measures the rupee’s value vis-à-vis not only the dollar, but other global currencies as well. In this case, it is a weighted average of the rupee’s exchange rate against a basket of 40 currencies of countries that account for about 88 per cent of India’s annual exports and imports. The REER also adjusts for inflation differentials between India and each of these trading partners.
The rupee’s REER — with 2015-16 as the base year — fell from 105.32 in January 2022 to 99.03 in April 2023. But since then, it has been on an appreciating trajectory.
The main reason for the divergence — the rupee’s simultaneous weakening and strengthening — has to do with the dollar’s behaviour over the past three months, especially post Trump’s victory.
In other words, the rupee isn’t weakening as much as the dollar is strengthening — against all currencies. The dollar is strengthening because of Trump’s public pronouncements favouring tariff hikes, income tax cuts and deportations of illegal immigrants.
From a longer timeframe, the rupee has, since the start of 2022, dipped against the dollar (from 74.30 to 85.19), euro (84.04 to 88.56) and pound (100.30 to 106.79), while firming up only against the yen (0.6454 to 0.5425). Despite that, its REER has increased. And that is a result of inflation in India being higher relative to its major partners.
Assuming the rupee was “fairly” valued in 2015-16, when the REER was set to 100, any value above 100 signifies overvaluation and the exchange rate not falling enough to offset higher domestic inflation. The rupee is, to that extent, is overvalued today, making imports cheaper and exports less competitive.

CONDUCT OF ELECTION RULES
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
The Centre recently amended the Conduct of Election Rules to restrict access for the public to a section of poll documents. This was done by the Union Law Ministry following a recommendation from the Election Commission (EC).
While the EC said the amendment aims to restrict access to electronic data, the Opposition and transparency activists have been up in arms, branding it as an attack on the right to information and electoral freedom.
The Conduct of Election Rules,1961, is a set of rules which provide for provisions on how to conduct the elections as per the Representation of People Act.
Rule 93(2)(a) of the 1961 Conduct of Election Rules had earlier stated that “all other papers relating to the election shall be open to public inspection” but after the amendment, it reads, “all other papers as specified in these rules relating to the election shall be open to public inspection.”
Why has the amendment been brought in now?
The move comes after a recent direction to the EC by the Punjab and Haryana High Court to share all documents related to the Haryana Assembly election, including treating CCTV footage also as permissible under Rule 93(2) of the Conduct of Election Rules, to a petitioner.
An official of the Election Commission explained that the rule previously mentioned election papers but did not explicitly refer to electronic records, leading to ambiguity. To address this and considering concerns over the violation of voting secrecy and the potential misuse of CCTV footage from polling stations, particularly through artificial intelligence, the rule was amended. The official noted that sharing such footage could have serious consequences, especially in sensitive regions like Jammu and Kashmir, where voters’ lives might be at risk.
Why are the transparency activists protesting?
RTI activists have termed the move as a setback to transparency. Rule 93 is akin to the Right to Information Act as far as elections are concerned and, any change hurts the citizen’s right to know about the process.
The amendment appears to aim at restricting citizens access to a wide range of documents generated during elections. Many of these documents are not explicitly mentioned in the Conduct of Election Rules but are referenced in handbooks and manuals published periodically by the Election Commission. These records include reports submitted by Election Observers, scrutiny reports from Returning Officers after polling day, and Index Cards sent to the Election Commission following the declaration of results, which contain detailed election statistics.
Given the controversy surrounding voter turnout in recent Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, access to the Presiding Officers’ diaries, which include detailed data about voter turnout at various times during polling day and the number of tokens distributed to voters in the queue at the scheduled closing hour, is not specifically mentioned in the Conduct of Election Rules. Yet access to such documents is crucial to assess the fairness of elections.

BELGAUM CONGRESS SESSION
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
The centenary celebrations of the historic 1924 Belgaum Congress session was inaugurated on December 26 in Belagavi (as Belgaum is now called).
The session remains historic because it is the only one chaired by Mahatma Gandhi (39th All-India Congress session). The leader, who arrived from South Africa became a Congress members in 1915, and became president of the all-India session after nine years.
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-200748" decoding="async" height="191" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/27-dna-2-300x191.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/27-dna-2-300x191.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/27-dna-2.png 605w" width="300"/>
Held from December 26 to December 28, 1924, in Belgaum (now Belagavi, Karnataka), this session marked a crucial phase in India’s struggle for independence.
Key Features and Importance:
Gandhi’s Leadership: This session highlighted Mahatma Gandhi’s influence within the Congress. It allowed him to address growing differences within the party and reaffirm his commitment to non-violence and Swaraj (self-rule).
Resolution on Unity: The session emphasized Hindu-Muslim unity, a theme central to Gandhi’s vision for a united struggle against colonial rule.
Focus on Grassroots Movements: Gandhi advocated for strengthening grassroots movements, including promoting khadi and boycotting foreign goods, as part of the larger non-cooperation strategy.
Strategic Recalibration: Coming after Gandhi’s release from prison following the Non-Cooperation Movement, the session provided an opportunity to reassess the movement’s direction and strategies.
As chairman of the session, Gandhiji reduced the annual membership fee by 90% and urged all party members to realise that the Congress was a movement, and that they were all social workers, working not only for political liberation from the British, but also from social evils like untouchability.
Apart from the routine sessions, the Belgaum session held separate conferences against untouchability and in favour of khadi and village industries, students, municipal administration, and formation of States on linguistic grounds.

**********Tapping into Kazakhstan’s Rare Earths Potential
Context
As the global shift toward renewable energy accelerates,
rare earth elements (REEs) have become vital for enabling cleaner technologies.
India, the third-largest carbon emitter globally, faces a growing need for rare earths
as it transitions to sustainable energy sources.
Despite being the fifth-largest holder of REE reserves
, India heavily depends on imports from China due to insufficient domestic extraction technologies.
However,
geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions have prompted India to diversify its sources,
with Kazakhstan emerging as a promising alternative.
Understanding the Strategic Challenge of China’s Rare Earth Monopoly
Geopolitical Leverage and Economic Influence
China has frequently leveraged its monopoly in rare earth elements as a geopolitical tool
, disrupting supplies to assert its strategic interests.
For instance,
it has imposed export restrictions or outright bans on critical minerals during diplomatic standoffs.
A recent example is its halt on antimony supplies
, a mineral integral to flame retardants, batteries, solar cells, and military applications, under the pretext of national security.
Additionally,
in December 2023, Beijing implemented a ban on exporting technologies related to rare earth extraction and magnet production
, further consolidating its grip on the sector.
Such actions illustrate how China wields its dominance
not just for economic advantage but also to influence global trade dynamics.
Concentrated Supply Chains and Global Dependence
China's control
over the rare earth industry also
stems from its vertically integrated supply chain.
It not only mines the resources but also processes them and manufactures high-value products like permanent magnets
, which are essential for wind turbines, electric vehicles, and defence technologies.
This comprehensive control ensures that nations reliant on rare earth imports have limited alternatives,
further entrenching their dependence on Beijing.
The
vulnerabilities of such concentrated supply chains became evident during geopolitical crises
, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Reduced Russian ore supplies,
primarily antimony concentrates used in renewable energy production,
exacerbated global reliance on Chinese sources.

Kazakhstan is a leading producer of tantalum and niobium, essential components for nuclear reactors
and clean energy technologies.
Strategic Connectivity and Proximity to India
Geographical proximity and shared strategic interests
further enhance
Kazakhstan’s appeal as a rare earth partner for India.
Initiatives such as the
‘Connect Central Asia’ policy and the International North-South Transport Corridor provide robust frameworks
for deepening economic and logistical ties between the two countries.
These connectivity projects aim to streamline trade routes
, reduce transportation costs, and facilitate the flow of critical materials like rare earth elements.
India’s increasing engagement with Kazakhstan is exemplified by high-level dialogues
and cooperative agreements.
the second India-Central Asia Summit saw discussions on establishing an ‘India-Central Asia Rare Earths Forum.’
India’s Renewable Energy Goals, Challenges, and the Path Forward
India’s Renewable Energy Goals and Challenges
India’s ambitious pledge at COP29 to achieve 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 underscores the critical role of REEs in this transition.
India’s current capacity across the rare earth supply chain remains insufficient.
While
the government aims to increase mining output by 400% over the next decade, challenges persist
, including limited extraction technologies and logistical hurdles in connecting with resource-rich regions like Kazakhstan.
The establishment of the ‘India-Central Asia Rare Earths Forum,
’ proposed during the second India-Central Asia Summit,
represents a strategic move to address these challenges.
initiative aims to foster bilateral training, joint mining ventures, and the exchange of geological expertise
, thereby paving the way for sustainable and efficient rare earth extraction.
Such collaborations could reduce India’s reliance on China
and create a regional market for critical minerals.
The Path Forward
India’s partnership with Kazakhstan offers a pathway to secure its rare earth needs
while reducing dependency on China.
By leveraging Kazakhstan’s advanced technologies
and vast reserves,
India can enhance its energy security and support its renewable energy transition.
Collaborative frameworks
, such as the proposed Rare Earths Forum,
will be instrumental in overcoming technological and logistical barriers.
Kazakhstan’s role as a strategic partner aligns with India’s broader geopolitical objectives.
Diversifying rare earth sources
through closer ties with Kazakhstan
not only enhances India’s energy security but also mitigates risks associated with China’s monopoly.
For Kazakhstan, collaboration with India provides an opportunity to expand its market reach and attract investments in mining and technology sectors.
Conclusion
Kazakhstan’s vast rare earth reserves, advanced extraction capabilities
, and strategic proximity to India,
position it as a compelling alternative to China.
By deepening ties with Kazakhstan, India can secure its rare earth supply chain
, support its renewable energy transition, and reduce its reliance on Chinese imports.
This partnership represents a mutually beneficial opportunity for economic growth, technological advancement, and geopolitical stability

**********China to build world’s largest hydropower dam in Tibet
Why in news?
China has approved the construction of the world's largest hydropower dam on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River (Brahmaputra) on the Tibetan plateau.
The ambitious project aims to produce 300 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity annually, more than tripling the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam, the current world leader in hydropower.
What’s in today’s article?
Course of the river Brahmaputra
China’s Brahmaputra Dam project
Concerns and implications of China's Tibet dam project on India
India’s response
The Brahmaputra, originating in Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo, flows through India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam before entering Bangladesh and emptying into the Bay of Bengal.
As a perennial river, it sustains communities through irrigation, fisheries, and inland transport.
While it enriches agriculture by depositing fertile alluvial soil, its lower course poses challenges with recurring, devastating floods in Assam and Bangladesh due to climatic and geographical conditions.
About
China is constructing the dam in Medog County, Tibet Autonomous Region, where the Yarlung Tsangpo drops 2,000 meters, creating ideal hydropower conditions.
The project is part of China’s renewable energy initiatives, aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 while promoting regional development in Tibet.
The project, costing $137 billion, is part of China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025) and Long-Range Objectives through 2035.
Scale and Significance of the Project
The dam is projected to generate up to 60 gigawatts of power, triple the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam.
It will produce 300 billion kWh of clean, renewable electricity annually, supporting Beijing’s clean energy targets and bolstering water security.
The project will generate 20 billion yuan ($3 billion) annually for Tibet.
Agriculture
The dam could retain a significant amount of silt, which is crucial for downstream agriculture. Reduced silt deposits may negatively impact the fertility of agricultural lands in India.
Water Resources
China claims the dam is a run-of-the-river hydropower project.
However, experts warn it could reduce water flow downstream during dry seasons and exacerbate flooding during monsoons if excess water is released, potentially causing disasters in Assam.
Potential Use of Water as a Weapon
China’s upstream position gives it control over the Brahmaputra’s flow.
During geopolitical tensions, such as the 2017 Doklam standoff, China withheld hydrological data crucial for flood forecasting, raising concerns over the weaponization of water resources.
Seismological Threats
The Himalayan region's seismic vulnerability could pose risks to downstream populations due to the scale of infrastructure projects like this dam.
Ecological Impact
The dam could disrupt the fragile Himalayan ecosystem, home to critically endangered species.
Combined with ongoing climate change effects, deforestation, and soil erosion, the ecological consequences may be severe.
India’s Response
India has urged China to safeguard downstream interests.
Additionally, India is planning a 10 GW hydropower project in the Dibang Valley, Arunachal Pradesh, to counterbalance the potential impacts of China’s dam.
Also, data sharing between India and China on trans-border rivers, established under the Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) in 2006, remains critical.

What’s in Today’s Article?
What is Migration?
Methodology Used by the EAC-PM for Finding Domestic Migration in India
Key Findings EAC-PM Paper on Domestic Migration in India
Challenges in Migration Data
Conclusion
Meaning:
Migration is the
movement of people away from their usual place of residence
, either internal (within the country) or international (across countries) borders.
The migration arising out of various
social, economic, or political reasons
helps in
understanding the dynamics of the society better.
Various forms and patterns of migration:
Internal migration
(rural-urban, intra-state, inter-state, etc.) refers to migration from one place to another within a country, while
external migration or international migration
refers to migration from one country to another.
Forced migration
refers to migration that is not chosen by the individual or family but is forced upon them by factors such as war, persecution, or natural disasters.
Voluntary migration
refers to migration that is chosen by the individual or family, driven by factors such as better economic opportunities or a desire for a better life.
Temporary migration
refers to migration that is intended to be of short duration, such as seasonal or temporary work.
Permanent migration
refers to migration that is intended to be of long duration, intending to settle permanently in a new place.
Reverse migration
refers to the migration of individuals or families (who have previously migrated), back to their country of origin or their original place of residence.
Methodology Used by the EAC-PM for Finding Domestic Migration in India:
The report used 3 datasets to estimate migration trends:
Indian Railway Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) for passenger volumes.
TRAI mobile roaming data to study seasonal movement.
District-level banking data for remittances.
These alternative sources were employed due to delays in the decennial Census, which is a more comprehensive but less timely data source.
Key Findings EAC-PM Paper on Domestic Migration in India:
Decline in migration numbers:
Overall reduction:
The number of migrants reduced from 45.57 crore (2011 Census) to 40.20 crore (2023).
Migration rate:
The migration rate dropped from 37.64% in 2011 to 28.88% in 2023.
Improved economic opportunities:
Migration is slowing due to better economic opportunities in smaller cities, improved infrastructure, and access to education and healthcare near traditional migration hubs.
This shift indicates overall economic growth in source regions.
Recipient states:
Top recipient states:
UP, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh remain prominent,
while West Bengal and Rajasthan are new entrants
, replacing Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.
Growth patterns:
States like West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Karnataka showed the highest growth in migrant arrivals, whereas Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh experienced a decline.
Regional migration trends:
Top origin districts:
Areas around major urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, and Kolkata remain prominent sources.
Top destination districts:
Mumbai, Bengaluru urban, Howrah, Central Delhi, and Hyderabad are key destinations.
Seasonality of migration:
Peak migration movements occur during April-June, with secondary peaks in November-December.
Post-pandemic data shows reduced passenger movement during these high months, with May 2023 levels 6.67% lower than May 2012.
Challenges in Migration Data:
The lack of regular and granular data
poses challenges in understanding migration patterns.
Existing reports, such as the MoSPI Migration in India 2020-21 and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MoHUPA) Working Group Report on Migration (2017),
highlight limitations in tracking trends effectively.
Conclusion:
The slowdown in domestic migration reflects

Criminalizes unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, making hacking a punishable offense.
Section 66:
Addresses cybercrime and provides penalties for violations of computer-related laws.
Section 69:
Allows government agencies to intercept data on grounds of national security but does not authorize the installation of spyware like Pegasus on devices without proper oversight.
Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009:
These rules require that no interception can occur without the direction and approval of a competent authority, aiming to provide some level of oversight.
Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA):
Recently passed in 2023, this act has faced criticism for allegedly providing legal cover for state surveillance while lacking robust protections for individual privacy rights. Critics argue that its vague language allows for arbitrary government.
What should be the next steps for Indian authorities following the US verdict? (Way forward)
Reinitiate Investigations:
Indian authorities should consider reopening investigations into Pegasus with renewed vigour, leveraging insights from the US court ruling. This includes calling for transparency from technology companies involved in the case.
Engage with Stakeholders:
Authorities should actively engage with WhatsApp, Apple, and other relevant parties to gather comprehensive evidence regarding the spyware’s use in India. This collaboration is crucial for establishing accountability.
Legislative Reforms:
There is an urgent need for systemic reforms in surveillance laws and practices in India. Authorities should work towards creating robust frameworks that protect citizens’ privacy rights and establish clear guidelines for state surveillance activities.
Public Disclosure:
To rebuild public trust, it is essential for the government to disclose findings from previous inquiries and commit to transparency moving forward. This includes making reports from technical committees publicly available
