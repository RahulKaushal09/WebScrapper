This is the second time in the past year that such a resolution has been passed.
What’s in today’s article?
Process of changing the name of a State
Resolution passed by Kerala Assembly
Process of Changing the Name of a State
Constitutional provision
Article 3 of the Indian Constitution outlines the process for changing the name of a state.
Article 3 also empowers the Parliament to:
Form new states by separating territory from existing states, uniting states or parts of states, or attaching a territory to a state.
Increase or decrease the area of a state.
Alter the boundaries of a state.
Proposal by the State Legislature
The proposal to change the name of a state typically begins with a resolution passed by the state legislature.
The resolution reflects the desire of the state to change its name.
This process can also be initiated by the central government through a proposal to change the name of a state.
Recommendation by the President
Once the state legislature passes the resolution, it is sent to the central government.
If the proposal is initiated by the Central govt, it must be submitted to the President of India.
The President of India must recommend the proposal to the Parliament before any action can be taken.
Introduction of a Bill in Parliament
A bill to alter the name of a state is introduced in either house of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha).
The bill can only be introduced with the prior recommendation of the President
Referral to the State Legislature
Before the bill is taken up for consideration in Parliament, the President is required to refer it to the legislature of the state concerned for expressing its views within a specified period.
This is done to seek the opinion of the state legislature on the proposed change.
Consideration of State Legislature's Views
The state legislature’s views are communicated back to the central government.
However, the
Parliament is not bound by the state legislature’s opinion. It is merely a consultative process
Passage of the Bill in Parliament
The bill must be passed by a simple majority in both houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha).
This means more than half of the members present and voting must approve the bill.
Assent of the President
Once both houses of Parliament pass the bill, it is sent to the President for assent.
Upon receiving the President’s assent, the bill becomes law, and the name of the state is officially changed.
Notification in the Official Gazette
The change in the state’s name is then notified in the Official Gazette of India. This marks the formal and legal change of the state’s name.
Resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly
About
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan moved a resolution stating that the state's name should be changed to "Keralam" in the Constitution to match its Malayalam name.
The Kerala Assembly unanimously requested the Union Government to make this change under Article 3.
A similar resolution was passed on August 9 last year but needed reintroduction due to technical issues.
The previous resolution aimed to amend the First Schedule (list of states) and inadvertently omitted a demand to amend the Eighth Schedule (list of official languages).
This oversight led to the reintroduction of the modified resolution.
Why Keralam
Kerala is the English version of the
Malayalam word "Keralam," with several theories about its etymology
The earliest mention is in
Emperor Ashoka’s Rock Edict II
from 257 BCE, referring to "Keralaputra" or "son of Kerala," associated with the Chera dynasty.
German linguist Dr. Herman Gundert noted that "keram" in Kannada corresponds to "cheram," describing the coastal land from Gokarna to Kanyakumari.
The term "cher" in Old Tamil means to join, possibly indicating the origin of the name.
Story of statehood
The demand for a united Malayalam-speaking state began in the 1920s, aiming to integrate Travancore, Cochin, and the Malabar district.
After independence, on July 1, 1949, Travancore and Cochin merged to form Travancore-Cochin.
The State Reorganisation Commission recommended creating states on linguistic bases.
This led to the inclusion of Malabar and Kasargod into the new state for Malayalam speakers and the exclusion of four southern taluks of Travancore, now part of Tamil Nadu.
erala was officially formed on November 1, 1956

**********Government Offers Ten New Critical Mineral Blocks
Why in the News?
The Ministry of Mines launched the fourth tranche of critical minerals auction, offering a total of 21 blocks across 14 states.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Critical Minerals (Meaning, Characteristics, Examples, Reserves, etc.)
News Summary
What are Critical Minerals?
Critical minerals are raw materials essential for economic and national security, often used in
high-tech industries
renewable energy technologies
They are typically rare, difficult to mine and substitute, and often vulnerable to supply chain disruptions due to limited global production and geopolitical factors.
The growing demand for these minerals, driven by technological advancements and the global transition to green energy, underscores their critical importance.
Securing a stable supply of critical minerals is thus a strategic priority for many countries to ensure economic stability and technological progress.
Characteristics of Critical Minerals:
Economic Importance:
Critical minerals are indispensable for the production of high-tech devices, electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems, and other key industries.
Supply Chain Vulnerability:
The supply of these minerals is often concentrated in a few countries, making them susceptible to geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and other disruptions.
Limited Substitutability:
These minerals typically have few or no viable substitutes, which means that any disruption in their supply can have significant economic and technological impacts.
Examples of Critical Minerals:
Lithium:
Used in lithium-ion batteries for EVs, consumer electronics, and energy storage systems.
According to the US Geological Survey (USGS),
Australia
Chile
boast the largest reserves of lithium available in mines around the world today.
Cobalt:
Essential for battery production, aerospace components, and other high-strength alloys.
Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) is by far the largest global supplier of cobalt, possessing almost half of all cobalt reserves in global mines.
Graphite:
Key for batteries, fuel cells, and high-temperature applications.
In 2023,
China
had the world's largest reserves of natural graphite, at approximately 78 million metric tons.
Nickel:
Important for stainless steel production and battery manufacturing.
Indonesia
boast the world’s largest reserves of nickel in global mines today.
Rare Earth Elements (REEs):
Vital for manufacturing electronics, magnets, and military applications.
According to estimates, the total worldwide reserves of rare earths amount to approximately 110 million metric tons.
Most of these reserves are located within China, estimated at some 44 million metric tons.
After China, the major rare earth countries based on reserve volume are Vietnam, Russia, and Brazil.
Critical Minerals Reserves in the World & India:
India does not have reserves of nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, rare earth elements, neodymium and indium, and the country’s requirement of copper and silver are higher than its current reserves.
India’s Critical Minerals Policy:
India is bolstering its position in the global supply chain of critical minerals like lithium and cobalt through domestic exploration and international partnerships. The Ministry of Mines, in collaboration with the joint venture
Khanij Bidesh India Ltd.
(KABIL), is acquiring critical mineral assets in Australia, Argentina, and Chile to ensure a steady supply.
India has joined the U.S.-led Mineral Security Partnership to enhance cooperation and investment in critical mineral supply chains.
The MMDR Amendment Act, 2023, empowers the Central Government to auction mining leases and licenses for 24 critical minerals, promoting self-sufficiency and advancing sectors like high-tech electronics, telecommunications, and renewable energy.
The first tranche of e-auction for 20 blocks of critical minerals, including lithium and rare earth elements, was launched on November 29, 2023. This initiative
aims to reduce import dependency, attract mining sector investments, and support India’s goal of becoming self-reliant (Atma Nirbhar Bharat)
Additionally, a new Exploration Licence has been introduced for 29 critical and deep-seated minerals, encouraging expertise and advanced technologies in mineral discovery and mining. This effort is expected to enhance domestic production, secure supply chains, and contribute to India's economic growth and technological advancement.
Government Offers Ten New Critical Mineral Blocks:
The Ministry of Mines launched the fourth tranche of critical minerals auction, offering 21 blocks across 14 states.
To incentivize exploration, the
ministry announced a scheme to reimburse up to Rs 20 crore in exploration expenses for license holders
The fourth tranche brings the total number of critical mineral blocks offered to 48.
The auction history has seen mixed results: out of 48 blocks, 24 have been annulled due to low bidder interest.
The ministry remains optimistic about successful re-auctions, with efforts to intensify investor engagement.
The newly announced
exploration reimbursement scheme
aims to boost investor interest.
License holders can claim up to Rs 20 crore for exploration activities and may receive additional reimbursements if they hand over a block for mining lease within three years.
This incentive addresses concerns about the need to re-auction blocks for mining after exploration.

**********What is in Great Nicobar, site of NITI Aayog’s mega Island Project?
Prelims Only
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Nicobar Triangle, GNI Project
Why in the News?
The opposition party has demanded the immediate suspension of all clearances granted to NITI Aayog’s Great Nicobar Island (GNI) Project.
It alleged violations of due process, legal and constitutional provisions protecting tribal communities.
Great Nicobar Island: An Overview
Geography and Ecology
: Southernmost tip of India, part of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago comprising 600-odd islands.
Environment
: Hilly, covered with lush rainforests, annual rainfall of around 3,500 mm.
Biodiversity
: Hosts numerous endangered and endemic species including the giant leatherback turtle, Nicobar megapode, Great Nicobar crake, Nicobar crab-eating macaque, and Nicobar tree shrew.
Area
: 910 sq km with mangroves and
Pandan forests
along the coast.
Indigenous Communities:
Shompen Tribe
: Approximately 250 people live in interior forests, predominantly hunter-gatherers, classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group.
Nicobarese Community
: Two groups – Great Nicobarese and Little Nicobarese, practice farming and fishing.
Resettlement
: The Great Nicobarese were resettled in Campbell Bay after the 2004 tsunami.
Administrative Hub
: Campbell Bay serves as the administrative hub, housing local offices of the Andaman and Nicobar administration and the panchayat.
Back2Basics:
“Nicobar Triangle”
It is named after the Nicobar Islands, which are located at the northern apex of this triangular area.
The islands within the Nicobar Triangle include:
: This group of islands belongs to India and is situated to the south of the Andaman Islands. They are known for their diverse flora and fauna and are inhabited by indigenous tribes.
: Located to the north of the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman Islands are also part of India. They are well-known for their lush forests, coral reefs, and indigenous tribes.
Indonesian Archipelago
: To the south and southeast of the Nicobar Islands lies the Indonesian archipelago, which includes thousands of islands spanning a vast area between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
What is GNI Project?
The GNI Project refers to the “Holistic Development of Great Nicobar Island,” a proposed mega project being piloted by NITI Aayog.
Implementing Agency
: The project is to be implemented by the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation (ANIIDCO).
Historical Context
: Development plans for a port in Great Nicobar date back to the 1970s, aimed at leveraging its strategic location near the Malacca Strait.
The project aims to develop the southern end of the Andaman and Nicobar group of Islands in the Bay of Bengal by constructing –
Transshipment port
Dual-use military-civil international airport
Power plant (450 MVA gas and solar-based) and
A township over a span of 30 years on more than 160 sq. km of land, of which 130 sq. km is primary forest
Features of the Project
Transshipment hub of the East:
The proposed port will allow Great Nicobar to participate in the regional and global maritime economy by becoming a major player in cargo transshipment.
Naval control:
The port will be controlled by the Indian Navy, while the airport will have dual military-civilian functions and will cater to tourism as well.
Urban amenities:
Roads, public transport, water supply and waste management facilities, and several hotels have been planned to cater to tourists.
Significance of the project
Economic significance:
The proposed port would allow GNI to become a significant player in cargo transhipment, as it is positioned equidistant from Colombo, Port Klang (Malaysia), and Singapore.
Strategic significance:
The proposal to develop GNI has been on the table since the 1970s, and it has been highlighted repeatedly as a crucial element for national security and consolidation of the Indian Ocean Region.
In recent years, the escalating Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean has added greater urgency to this imperative.
Issues with the Project
The project entails the deforestation of 130 sq km, and felling 10 lakh trees, threatens biodiversity at
Galathea Bay
, displaces indigenous tribes, lacks thorough impact assessments, and poses seismic risks to vulnerable communities.
Due-process Violations highlighted by the ‘Opposition’
(1) Did not recognise the grant ownership:
The island administration did not recognise or grant ownership of any forest land to local tribespeople as per FRA, a requisite step under the Forest Conservation Rules, 2017, before Stage-I clearance is granted.
This is despite the fact that Rule 6(3)(e) of Forest Conservation Rules-2017 (FCR) requires that any diversion of forest land first requires the District Collector to recognise and vest rights to locals under the FRA.
The legislation allows forest communities the right to control and manage the use of the forest land over which they hold titles, and their consent is mandatory for diverting it.
(2) Inconsistencies with Stage-I Clearance:
The Stage-I clearance for the project was granted in October 2022, two years after the application was received. Monthly progress reports show that the district administration did not process any claims over forest land under the FRA in the 26 months since project sanction.
(3) Withdrawal of Consent:
Weeks after the Stage-I clearance was granted, the Tribal Council at Campbell Bay withdrew the consent granted by the Gram Sabha.

Mains level:
16th Finance Commission can catalyse municipal-level financial reforms
Why in the news?
With the new Lok Sabha and Union government in place, this final piece focuses on how the 16th Finance Commission can drive substantive public finance reforms for India’s cities.
Note:
The Sixteenth Finance Commission has been requested to make its recommendations available by October 31, 2025, covering an award period of 5 years commencing 1st April, 2026.
Strengthening State Finance Commissions:
The Commission should emphasize the need for state governments to constitute state finance commissions on time, provide them with adequate resources, and ensure their recommendations are taken seriously.
Fiscal Decentralization:
The 16th FC should recommend a formula-based approach for predictable fiscal transfers from state governments to municipalities, moving away from the current practice of ad hoc, discretionary grants. This will enhance the financial autonomy of urban local bodies.
Revenue Optimization:
The Commission should incentivize municipalities to enhance their own revenues through measures like property tax reforms, user charges, and leveraging land assets. This will reduce their dependence on state grants and promote fiscal responsibility.
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management:
The 16th FC can provide incentives for municipalities to adopt fiscal responsibility and budget management frameworks to accelerate municipal borrowings for infrastructure development. This will enable cities to access capital markets for financing their growth.
Transparency and Citizen Participation:
The 16th FC can encourage municipalities to enhance transparency and citizen participation in urban governance for improved accountability at the neighbourhood level. This will make urban local bodies more responsive to the needs of citizens.
Need for the Reforms
Inadequate Funding and Resource Utilization:
Indian cities face significant financial shortfalls and struggle to effectively utilize the funds they have, leading to underdeveloped infrastructure and services.
Lack of Accountability:
There is minimal accountability regarding how municipal spending improves citizens’ lives, resulting in inefficient use of resources and unmet public needs.
Cities need predictable fiscal transfers for effective planning, but state governments often delay constituting State Finance Commissions (SFCs) and implementing their recommendations.
Cities underutilize their revenue-generating powers due to outdated valuation processes controlled by state governments. Comprehensive reforms are needed at all stages of revenue collection.
Transparency and Fiscal Responsibility:
The legal framework for financial accounting, reporting, and budgeting is inconsistent across states. Standardized formats, mandatory accounting standards, and management accounting systems are necessary to improve transparency and fiscal responsibility.
Activities by State Governments
Timely Constitution and Implementation of State Finance Commissions:
State governments must ensure the timely establishment and effective implementation of SFC recommendations to support fiscal decentralization and provide predictable funding to cities.
Updating Valuation Processes:
States should regularly update guidance values or circle rates to reflect current market values, enabling cities to optimize revenue collection and ensure financial sustainability.
Enhancing Legal and Institutional Frameworks:
States should establish and enforce standardized formats for financial accounting, reporting, and budgeting to ensure consistency, transparency, and comparability across municipalities.
Empowering Local Governments:
States should delegate reasonable expenditure authority to city councils, reducing dependency on state-level approvals and enabling more efficient and responsive local governance.
Mandating Transparency and Citizen Participation:
States should mandate public disclosure of municipal financial data and project details in machine-readable formats and support the implementation of participatory budgeting to enhance transparency and citizen involvement in governance.
Conclusion:
The 16th Finance Commission can drive critical municipal-level financial reforms by strengthening state finance commissions, promoting fiscal decentralization, optimizing revenues, enhancing fiscal responsibility, and encouraging transparency and citizen participation in governance.
Mains PYQ:
How is the Finance Commission of India constituted? What do you know about the terms of reference of the recently constituted Finance Commission? Discuss.

**********How the PESA has boosted forest conservation in India
Polity

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
PESA Act
Mains level:
How PESA ensures Equitable Representation
Why in the news?
Conservation policies in India have long wrestled with dual conflicts: balancing conservation goals against local communities’ resource extraction needs, and reconciling conservation with the imperative of economic development.
Structural Mandate of Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA):
PESA was passed in 1996 and it mandates local government councils in Scheduled Areas
to reserve all chairperson positions and at least half of the seats for Scheduled Tribes (ST).
This legislative framework is designed to empower marginalized communities by giving them a
direct say in local governance and resource management.
Implementation in India:
Unlike the 73rd Amendment (which applies to non-Scheduled Areas), PESA ensures mandated representation for STs in decision-making bodies.
Variations in PESA implementation across states highlight challenges and successes in translating legislative intent into effective governance structures.
How it Ensures Equitable Representation:
Impact on Forest Conservation:
The study employs a “difference-in-differences” methodology to analyze the effect of PESA on forest cover. Findings indicate that areas with mandated ST representation under PESA experience lower rates of deforestation and higher afforestation rates compared to areas without such representation.
Economic Incentives for Conservation:
ST communities, dependent on forest resources for livelihoods, are incentivized to protect forest cover under PESA. This “forest stewardship” mechanism emerges as STs engage in sustainable practices and resist deforestation pressures driven by mining and commercial interests.
On Democratic Decentralization:
Comparison with Administrative Decentralization:
The paper distinguishes between administrative decentralization (focused on efficiency) and democratic decentralization. Democratic decentralization, as exemplified by PESA, emphasizes representative and accountable local governance structures with decision-making autonomy over resource management.
Single Umbrella Institution:
Advocates for consolidating power into a single, empowered institution that integrates both conservation and development objectives. Such an institution would better navigate the complexities of balancing local economic interests with sustainable conservation practices.
Conclusion:
PESA serves as a critical example of how legislative mandates for political representation can drive positive environmental outcomes while addressing socio-economic disparities among forest-dwelling communities in India.
Mains PYQ:
What are the two major legal initiatives by the state since Independence, addressing discrimination against Scheduled Tribes (ST)?

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Power markets working and Power exchanges in India
Why in the news?
Amid rising summer demand, the government has permitted the trading of excess electricity produced from “linkage coal” within the nation’s power markets.
What is the Power Market?
A power market is a platform where electricity is bought and sold, enabling generators and consumers to trade electricity based on market-driven prices and conditions.
Types of Markets related to Power exchanges in India include:
Spot Markets:
These include real-time markets (RTM) and day-ahead markets (DAM). RTM allows for immediate buying and selling of electricity, while DAM involves bidding for electricity to be delivered the next day.
Term-Ahead Markets:
These markets facilitate trades for longer durations, ranging from hours to several days in advance, providing more certainty and planning for market participants.
Their working and Power exchanges in India
Market Operation:
Power exchanges in India operate as platforms where electricity generators (sellers) and consumers (buyers) participate in trading electricity. Generators submit offers indicating the quantity of electricity they can supply at various prices, while buyers submit bids indicating the quantity they wish to purchase at various prices.
Renewable Energy Certificates (REC):
Power exchanges also manage the trading of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). RECs represent the environmental attributes of renewable electricity generated and can be sold to utilities to meet their renewable purchase obligations (RPOs).
Regulation:
Power exchanges are regulated by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) in India. The regulatory framework ensures fair and transparent trading practices, oversees market operations and sets rules to promote market integrity.
Market Dominance:
The Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) is the dominant power exchange in India, handling the majority of electricity trading volume. Other exchanges include Power Exchange India Limited (PXIL) and Hindustan Power Exchange Ltd (HPX), though IEX holds more than 90% of the market share.
Their advantages
Flexibility:
Enables generators to respond swiftly to fluctuating electricity demand by selling surplus power at market-driven prices, enhancing grid stability.
Efficiency:
Optimizes utilization of coal-based power generation assets, minimizing wastage and maximizing revenue through market-based transactions.
Transparency:
Promotes transparent pricing mechanisms in the electricity sector, fostering competitive market dynamics and benefiting consumers with potentially lower electricity costs.
The Road Ahead for Power Exchanges:
Market Coupling:
It matches bids from different power exchanges to discover a uniform market clearing price, promoting efficiency and reducing price disparities across regions.It enhances price discovery, market stability, and regional grid integration by providing a reliable reference price for policymakers.
Capacity Markets:
It compensates generators for maintaining available capacity, incentivizing investment in reliable generation infrastructure. They ensure long-term grid reliability, especially during peak demand periods, aligning India’s power market with international standards and attracting investment.
International Alignment and Competitiveness:
India’s adoption of advanced market structures (like market coupling and capacity markets) aims to align with mature international markets.These developments can foster greater competition, attract investment, and enhance overall sector efficiency and reliability.
Mains PYQ:
Write a note on India’s green energy corridor to alleviate the problem of conventional energy.
