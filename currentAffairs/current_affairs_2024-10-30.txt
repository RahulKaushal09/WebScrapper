Highlights of the Bulletin
The globally averaged surface concentration of
reached 420 parts per million (ppm),
1934 parts per billion and
9 parts per billion (ppb) in 2023.
Carbon
is the single most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere related to human activities, accounting for approximately 64
percent
of the warming effect on the climate, mainly because of fossil fuel combustion and cement production,
The long-term carbon dioxide increase is due to fossil fuel combustion, but there are year-to-year variations due to the El Nino–Southern Oscillation, which impacts photosynthetic carbon dioxide uptake, respiratory release, and fires.
Methane

**********A collective effort towards peace in Myanmar
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Importance of Myanmar;
Why in the News?
The 44th ASEAN Summit in Vientiane highlighted growing regional issues, especially Myanmar’s crisis. Despite ASEAN’s peace efforts, Myanmar’s turmoil persists, testing the group’s commitment to stability.
What are the key challenges facing ASEAN and India in their efforts to stabilize Myanmar?
Lack of Consensus within ASEAN
: ASEAN’s principle of consensus-based decision-making complicates strong, unified responses.
Nations like Indonesia and Malaysia advocate for firm action, while others, including Thailand and Laos, maintain closer ties with Myanmar’s military government, slowing decisive actions.
Failure of the Five-Point Consensus
: Despite ASEAN’s efforts to enforce the 2021 Five-Point Consensus, which mandates an end to violence and inclusive dialogue, Myanmar’s military has shown little interest in cooperating, undermining ASEAN’s credibility.
Exclusion of Key Groups
: ASEAN’s initiatives mainly engage the junta without including the
National Unity Government (NUG)
Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs)
, limiting the inclusiveness and effectiveness of peace efforts.
Worsening Humanitarian Crisis
: Myanmar’s civil war has led to massive displacement and humanitarian needs, with over 18.6 million people requiring aid.
This poses logistical and diplomatic challenges for ASEAN and complicates India’s border security and refugee policies.
Balancing Regional and Security Concerns for India
: India faces a dilemma balancing its Act East Policy objectives and the need for stability on its Myanmar border.
Issues such as cross-border militancy, illegal activities, and the refugee crisis strain India’s relations with the junta and impact regional connectivity projects.
How can Inclusive dialogue be achieved among all stakeholders in Myanmar?
ASEAN must involve non-state actors like the
NUG, EAOs, and the People’s Defense Forces (PDFs)
in dialogue efforts to ensure all key groups have a stake in Myanmar’s peace process.
Thailand’s recent
‘Troika’ proposal
to host talks with ASEAN chairs (current, past, and future) and possibly other stakeholders indicates a potential pathway for more flexible discussions, albeit with the need for junta cooperation and broader participant involvement.
Establishing humanitarian corridors
that operate beyond junta-controlled areas, with the cooperation of EAOs, could lay the groundwork for inclusive engagement and build trust among conflicting parties.
What role does India’s Foreign Policy play in addressing the Myanmar crisis? (Way forward)
Strategic Engagement and Regional Connectivity
: Under its
, India invests in key infrastructure projects like the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project, linking Myanmar and ASEAN.
Balanced Relations with Junta and Democracy Advocates:
Need to principles of
non-interference
, India maintains ties with Myanmar’s military and democratic groups, addressing security needs while ethically supporting democratic aspirations.
As per Gujral Doctrine:
India should engage constructively with Myanmar, respecting its sovereignty, promoting regional connectivity, and fostering dialogue among all stakeholders to enhance stability and mutual prosperity.
Mains PYQ:
Evaluate the economic and strategic dimensions of India’s Look East Policy in the context of the post-Cold War international scenario.

**********Delimitation, women’s quota
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Women Reservation; Implication of reservation in politics;
Why in the News?
The Centre has hinted that the delayed Census might begin next year and finish by 2026, which would play a key role in redrawing constituencies and starting women’s reservations in elected bodies.
What are the implications of the Women’s Reservation Bill for women’s political representation in India?
Increased Representation
: The bill, once implemented, will reserve
33% of seats
in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies for women, marking a significant increase in women’s representation and fostering a more inclusive legislative environment.
Long-Term Social Change
: With more women in legislative positions, issues relevant to women’s rights, safety, and empowerment could receive greater legislative focus, driving long-term societal shifts toward gender equality.
Gradual Integration
: By mandating women’s reservation for
15 years post-implementation
, the bill allows time for systemic integration of women into Indian politics, potentially encouraging more women to enter politics.
Key features of the Women’s Reservation Bill:
Reservation of Seats:
The bill reserves one-third of all seats in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies for women, including those seats already reserved for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).
Implementation Timeline:
The reservation will come into effect after the next census is conducted and published, which has not yet been scheduled. The law is set to remain in place for 15 years, with provisions for extension.
Rotating Constituencies:
Reserved seats will be rotated after each delimitation exercise to ensure fair representation across different regions.
How does the delimitation process affect the implementation of the Women’s Reservation Bill?
Dependency on Delimitation
: The reservation will only be implemented following a census-based delimitation exercise, making the timeline for reservation contingent on the next Census, expected to conclude in 2026.
Thus, the reservation may only be actionable around the
2029 general elections.
Impact on Seat Allocation
: The delimitation exercise will likely increase the total seats in the Lok Sabha, which could make implementing the
33% reservation
less disruptive.
For example, if Lok Sabha seats rise to around
770
, this will allow for a more balanced accommodation of both male and female representatives without substantial loss of seats for male incumbents.
Challenges and Criticisms Surrounding the Women’s Reservation Bill and Its Implementation:
Delay in Implementation
: As the reservation is contingent on delimitation, the immediate impact of the bill remains deferred.
Critics argue that the reservation could be enacted sooner if it did not depend on the Census and delimitation.
Intra-Party Resistance
: Male incumbents might resist the bill due to concerns over losing their seats, and political parties might face difficulties balancing this resistance with the need for compliance, despite an increase in overall seats.
Exclusion of Other Marginalized Women
: The bill lacks sub-quotas for women from marginalized communities, such as SC/ST/OBCs, sparking criticism that it may predominantly benefit women from privileged backgrounds rather than addressing the political representation gap for all women.
Dependence on Census Accuracy
: Any delays or inaccuracies in Census data could delay the bill’s impact or result in skewed representation due to reliance on outdated demographic data.
Way forward:
Expedite Delimitation and Census
: Streamline Census and delimitation processes to ensure timely data collection and boundary adjustments, enabling earlier implementation of the reservation without prolonged delays.
Include Sub-Quotas for Marginalized Women
: Introduce provisions for SC/ST/OBC sub-quotas within the reservation to ensure fair representation of women from diverse social backgrounds, addressing inclusivity concerns in political representation.
Mains PYQ:
“The reservation of seats for women in the institutions of local self-government has had a limited impact on the patriarchal character of the Indian Political Process.” Comment.

**********Why India is at risk of becoming a ‘diminishing democracy’
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Democracy and Challenges in India;
Why in the News?
In her book “
Democracy on Trial: Majoritarianism and Dissent in India”,
Zoya Hasan points out that, though India’s democracy is strong in elections, it has struggled with fairness and freedoms due to growing majoritarianism since 2014.
What factors contribute to the erosion of civil liberties in India?
Majoritarian Politics:
Since a decade ago, India’s democracy has seen a shift toward majoritarianism, with the rights of minorities, particularly Muslims, facing marginalization.
This tilt toward majoritarian views fosters unequal treatment, weakening the universal protection of civil liberties and undermining the democratic principles of inclusion and equality.
Compromised Media Landscape:
Traditionally, media acted as a watchdog on power, but now it frequently functions as a government advocate.
This shift has narrowed public discourse on civil rights and accountability, reducing the media’s role in preserving civil liberties.
Legislation Targeting Minorities:
Laws such as the
Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA
) are seen as religiously discriminatory, especially when considered with the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
Such laws challenge the Constitution’s guarantee of equal rights for all citizens, placing undue pressure on certain communities and further eroding civil liberties.
Role of Political Institutions in Undermining Democracy:
Judicial Autonomy and its Challenges:
While the judiciary has traditionally been a pillar of democracy, recent trends indicate compromised judicial independence.
There are instances where courts appear reluctant to challenge the executive because political pressure may be impacting judicial autonomy, thereby diminishing an essential check on power.
Media’s Decline as a Check on Power:
Media independence has weakened as corporate and political influences have taken root, limiting its role in holding power to account.
Legislative and Executive Power Dynamics:
The increasing concentration of power within the executive, combined with a legislative body that often aligns with the ruling agenda, limits checks and balances.
Impact of Political Polarization on Democratic Processes:
Divisive Identity Politics:
Identity-based polarization is intensifying, with significant events such as the Ayodhya dispute and the Shaheen Bagh protests illustrating how political narratives can frame majority identities against minority rights.
Silencing of Dissent:
Governmental responses to protests, like those against the CAA, often include the use of force, indicating reduced tolerance for opposition.
Steps taken by the Election Commission of India:
Voter Education and Awareness Campaigns:
The ECI has launched extensive voter education campaigns to promote awareness about the electoral process, emphasizing the importance of informed voting.
Monitoring and Regulation of Political Parties:
The ECI has increased scrutiny over political parties’ funding and activities to ensure transparency.
Strengthening Electoral Laws:
Recent amendments to electoral laws have been made to enhance the integrity of elections.
Use of Technology:
The ECI has implemented technology-driven solutions such as Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) to ensure transparency and reliability in the voting process.
Way forward:
Strengthening Institutional Independence
: Reinforce the autonomy of key institutions like the judiciary, media, and law enforcement through stricter legal safeguards and transparent appointment processes.
Promoting Inclusive and Balanced Governance
: Establish mechanisms to ensure equal representation and protection for all communities, addressing grievances through impartial review processes. Implementing inclusive governance policies can help counter majoritarian biases and foster a more cohesive democratic environment.
Mains PYQ:
To enhance the quality of democracy in India the Election Commission of India has proposed electoral reforms in 2016. What are the suggested reforms and how far are they significant to make democracy successful?
