Key outcome of the Swiss Peace Summit
India’s stand at the summit
About
The Swiss Peace Summit, also known as the Summit on Peace in Ukraine, is an international conference aimed at addressing and finding solutions to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
Held at the Bürgenstock resort in Switzerland, this summit gathers representatives from various countries and organizations to discuss and promote peace initiatives.
Objective
The primary goal of the Swiss Peace Summit is to facilitate dialogue and negotiations aimed at ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has been ongoing since February 2022.
Participants
The summit brings together a wide range of participants, including representatives from numerous countries, international organizations, and peace advocacy groups.
In the recently held summit, 80 countries and four organizations supported the final joint communiqué.
Key outcome of Swiss Peace Summit
Joint Communiqué:
A final joint communiqué was issued, supported by 80 countries and four organizations out of the 100 attending delegations.
This document outlines the collective consensus and recommendations for achieving peace between Russia and Ukraine.
Territorial integrity of Ukraine should be respected
According to the communique, the territorial integrity of Ukraine should be the basis for any peace agreement to end Russia’s war.
Important themes featured in the final statement
The three themes of nuclear safety, food security and prisoner exchanges featured in the final statement.
It said that:
Any threat or use of nuclear weapons in the context of the ongoing war against Ukraine is inadmissible;
Food security must not be weaponized in any way.
Ukrainian agricultural products should be securely and freely provided to interested third countries
It emphasized that:
All prisoners of war must be released by complete exchange;
All deported and unlawfully displaced Ukrainian children, and all other Ukrainian civilians who were unlawfully detained, must be returned to Ukraine.
Commitment to Peace
Participants expressed a strong commitment to ending the war, emphasizing the need for continued dialogue and diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.
Humanitarian Aid
The summit underscored the importance of providing humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict, including displaced persons and civilians in war-torn areas.
International Cooperation
The summit facilitated international cooperation and solidarity, with countries and organizations pledging to work together to promote peace and stability in the region.
India attended the summit
India had joined the summit to explore the way forward to a negotiated settlement of a very complex and pressing issue.
India was represented by the Secretary (West) in the Ministry of External Affairs.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the summit.
However, India, which has strategic ties with Moscow and a strong dependence on Russia for defence supplies, decided to send a Secretary-level official for the summit.
Ever since the war began, India has also been buying Russian oil at discounted prices to cushion the inflationary impact of rising oil prices.
Decided not to sign the joint communique
India decided to not sign the joint communique by saying that only those options acceptable to both parties can lead to abiding peace.
It underlined that enduring peace can be achieved only through dialogue and diplomacy.
Reasons behind the Indian position of not becoming a signatory to the joint communique
Russia- one of the two warring parties —declined to attend the summit in Burgenstock in central Switzerland.
With Russia not attending the Swiss summit on peace in Ukraine, there can not be a lasting peace on this issue.
Other countries which did not sign the final communique
Besides
India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, Indonesia, Mexico and UAE
were among countries participating at the summit on peace for Ukraine but did not sign a final communique.
Brazil, which was listed as an observer on the list of attendees, also did not feature as a signatory.

**********Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary: India’s Second Home for Cheetahs
Why in News?
The Madhya Pradesh government has completed its preparations for the reintroduction of the cheetahs in the Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary, which will be the second home for cheetahs in India, after the Kuno National Park (KNP).
Under the
ambitious cheetah reintroduction project
, 8 Namibian cheetahs were released into enclosures at KNP in MP’s Sheopur district on September 17, 2022.Later (in February 2023), 12 more cheetahs were brought from South Africa.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About the Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary
Preparations for the Introduction of Cheetahs in Gandhi Sagar
Challenges in Making Gandhi Sagar a Viable Cheetah Habitat
About the Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary:
Location:
The sanctuary (notified in
1974
) is spread across (an area of 368.62 sq km) the districts of Mandsaur (187.12 sq km) and Neemuch (181.5 sq km) in
western MP
, right on the border with Rajasthan.
The Chambal River
cuts the sanctuary into two almost equal halves and the
Gandhi Sagar dam
(constructed on the river in 1960) lies within the area of the sanctuary.
Ecosystem:
Due to the rocky terrain and shallow topsoil, the
savanna ecosystem
- comprising open grasslands interspersed with dry deciduous trees and shrubs, belongs to the sanctuary.
However, the riverine valleys of the sanctuary are
evergreen
Why is Gandhi Sagar an ideal habitat for cheetahs?
According to MP’s wildlife officials,
the sanctuary makes for perfect cheetah habitat
, as it looks like
Maasai Mara
- a national reserve in Kenya known for its savanna wilderness and wildlife.
Preparations for the Introduction of Cheetahs in Gandhi Sagar:
Currently,
an area of 64 sq km has been developed for the cheetahs
, at a cost of Rs. 17.72 crores.
A soft release enclosure
(or boma, which is 1 sq km in area) has been constructed to ensure a suitable and secure habitat for the cheetahs upon their arrival.
A hospital
has also been constructed to cater to the needs of cheetahs.
In order to gauge the existing ecological dynamics, the wildlife officials are currently in the process of
conducting a comprehensive status assessment of herbivores and predators
in the sanctuary.
The Chairperson of the Cheetah Steering Committee
was tasked to oversee and evaluate the overall readiness of the WLS -
To ensure that the sanctuary is adequately equipped and prepared and
To support the successful integration and conservation of cheetahs within its natural landscape.
Challenges in Making Gandhi Sagar a Viable Cheetah Habitat:
Food:
For cheetahs to sustainably survive in Gandhi Sagar, the first step is
prey base augmentation
, i.e. increasing the number of animals that the wild cats can prey upon.
Leopard and other co-predators:
Just like in Kuno, the leopard population in Gandhi Sagar will pose a threat to cheetahs, with the two feline predators possibly clashing with each other for the same prey.
Human habitation:
Unlike Kuno, highways and human habitation pass right outside the boundary of the protected area in Gandhi Sagar.
Inter and intra state coordination:
The potential of expanding the cheetah habitat in Gandhi Sagar to an area of around 2,000 sq km will depend on
The coordination between
Rajasthan’s
Bhainsrodgarh sanctuary,
As well as the territorial divisions of
Mandsaur and Neemuch
Infection:
The final call on when the cheetahs will be imported from Namibia and South Africa will be made after the monsoons, during which the cats may be vulnerable to infection.

**********INCOIS’ New Product to Forecast El Nino and La Nina
Why in the News?
Hyderabad-based Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has developed a new product to predict the emergence of El Nino and La Nina conditions.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About INCOIS (Meaning, Objective, Activities)
About ENSO (Meaning, El Nino, La Nina, etc.)
About INCOIS:
Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) is an autonomous organization, established in 1999, under the Ministry of Earth Sciences.
It is a unit of the Earth System Science Organization (ESSO).
: To provide ocean data, information and advisory services to society, industry, the government and the scientific community.
Activities of INCOIS Include
Provides round-the-clock monitoring and warning services for the coastal population on tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, etc.
Provides daily advisories to fisher folk to help them easily locate areas of abundant fish in the ocean while saving on both fuel and time used to search for the same.
Short term (3-7 days) Ocean State Forecasts (waves, currents, sea surface temperature, etc.) are issued daily.
Deploys and maintains a suite of Ocean Observing Systems in the Indian Ocean to collect data on various oceanic parameters to understand the processes in the ocean and to predict their changes.
What is ENSO (El Nino and Southern Oscillation)?
ENSO is one of the most important climate phenomena on earth due to its
ability to change the global atmospheric circulation
, which in turn, influences temperature and precipitation across the globe.
Though ENSO is a single climate phenomenon, it has three states, or phases, it can be in:
El Nino:
This phase is characterized by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.
El Nino typically leads to altered weather patterns around the world, including increased rainfall in the southern United States and Peru, and drought conditions in Australia, Indonesia, and India.
It can also affect marine life due to changes in nutrient availability in the ocean.
La Nina:
This phase features unusually cold sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.
La Nina generally causes the opposite weather effects of El Nino.
For instance, it can lead to increased rainfall in Australia and Indonesia, and drier conditions in the southwestern United States.
La Nina events can also influence hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean, often increasing the number of hurricanes.
Neutral:
In this phase, sea surface temperatures and atmospheric conditions in the equatorial Pacific are near average.
This phase is also sometimes referred to as ENSO-neutral.
During this phase, the global weather patterns are more stable and not significantly influenced by the extreme conditions seen during El Nino or La Nina.
New Product to Forecast El Nino and La Nina:
Known as
Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network
(BCNN), the new product uses the latest technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), deep learning, and machine learning (ML) to improve forecasts related to the ENSO phases.
Working of BCNN:
The model predicts El Nino or La Nina by observing slow changes in the ocean and how they interact with the atmosphere.
This interaction allows enough time to make early forecasts.
The prediction uses the Nino3.4 index, which helps identify the different ENSO phases.
This index is calculated by averaging the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in a specific part of the central equatorial Pacific, ranging from 5°N to 5°S latitude and 170°W to 120°W longitude.

About the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
It is a regional intergovernmental organization that aims to promote economic, political, and cultural cooperation among its member states.
The GCC was established in 1981 and currently consists of six Arab countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The council’s main headquarters is located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
What is the Kafla system?
The Kafala system is a sponsorship system used in several Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. It governs the legal status of migrant workers, particularly those from other countries in Asia and Africa, who come to work in these countries. It binds migrant workers to a specific employer, known as the “kafeel,” who is responsible for the worker’s visa and legal status.
:  sponsorship by local sponsor or employer in West Asian countries
Migrants’ Rights in GCC countries:
Vulnerabilities of Migrant Workers:
Migrant workers in GCC countries face systemic vulnerabilities due to the Kafala system, tying their legal status to employers who control their accommodation, wages, and freedom of movement. Lack of independent legal status and dependency on employers make them susceptible to exploitation, poor living conditions, and arbitrary deportations.
Living Conditions and Safety:
Many migrants live in crowded and substandard accommodations, which exacerbate risks during emergencies such as fires, as seen in the Mangaf tragedy. Safety standards in workplaces and living spaces often fall short, posing significant risks to migrants’ health and well-being.
Legal Protections and Access to Justice:
Legal protections for migrant workers vary, with some categories like domestic workers often excluded from labor laws and protections. Limited access to justice and the ability to organize or unionize further restrict their ability to advocate for improved rights and conditions.
India’s Relationship with GCC Countries:
Economic Dependence and Migrant Workforce:
India has a significant economic relationship with GCC countries, with millions of Indian migrants working across sectors such as construction, healthcare, and services. Remittances from GCC countries contribute significantly to India’s economy, highlighting the mutual economic interdependence.
Diplomatic and Policy Engagements:
India engages diplomatically with GCC countries to safeguard the interests and welfare of its migrant workers, advocating for better working conditions, legal protections, and safety measures. Bilateral agreements and negotiations focus on labour rights, remittance flows, and crisis management during emergencies affecting Indian migrants.
What India can do? (Way forward)
Diplomatic Engagement and Advocacy:
Strengthen diplomatic ties with GCC countries to advocate for better working conditions, legal protections, and safety measures for Indian migrants.
Consular Services and Support:
Enhance consular services and support networks in GCC countries to provide timely assistance, legal aid, and emergency relief to Indian migrant workers.

**********What is SWM Cess and Why is It Levied on Waste Generators?
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Implication of SWM Cess
Why in the news?
The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahangara Palike (BBMP) has proposed a Solid Waste Management (SWM) Cess of ₹100 per month for each household.
What is Cess?
A cess is a form of tax or levy imposed by governments to fund specific services or purposes, such as waste management or infrastructure development.
How has the SWM cess fared so far?
Purpose of SWM Cess:
SWM Cess is intended to cover a portion of the costs incurred by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in providing SWM services, which are resource-intensive and crucial for maintaining cleanliness and health standards in urban areas.
Legal Provisions:
According to the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, ULBs are mandated to collect user fees/cess for SWM services. The proposed increase reflects the rising costs and challenges faced by ULBs in managing solid waste effectively.
Why has it hit the headlines suddenly?
Significant Increase in User Fee:
The proposed SWM Cess represents a substantial increase from the previous user fees typically charged by ULBs (Urban Local Bodies) across India, which are generally in the range of ₹30-50 per month. Such a significant rise in fees has garnered attention and sparked debate among residents and stakeholders in Bengaluru.
Impact on Residents:
The SWM Cess directly affects every household in Bengaluru, potentially adding financial burden on residents. This has led to widespread discussions and concerns among citizens about the affordability and justification of the proposed increase.
How has Bengaluru been handling its solid waste management?
Current Challenges:
Bengaluru faces significant challenges in solid waste management (SWM) due to its large population and high daily waste generation of approximately 5,000 tonnes. Managing such volumes requires extensive resources and infrastructure.
Operational Focus:
The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahangara Palike (BBMP) primarily focuses its SWM efforts on the collection and transportation of waste. These activities are labour-intensive and consume a major portion of BBMP’s budget allocated for SWM services.
Financial Strain:
SWM services constitute a substantial portion of BBMP’s budget, with limited revenue generated from these services. This financial strain necessitates the proposal of initiatives like the SWM Cess to bridge the funding gap and ensure sustainable service delivery.
What is about to change going forward?
Proposed Changes:
Going forward, Bengaluru plans to implement several changes in its SWM strategy. These include revising user fees and potentially increasing charges on bulk waste generators to better cover operational costs and enhance service efficiency.
Strategies for Improvement:
BBMP aims to enhance waste management practices through initiatives such as waste segregation at source, promoting decentralized composting centres, and launching public awareness campaigns. These efforts are aimed at optimizing resource utilization and improving overall SWM effectiveness in the city.
Mains PYQ:
What are the impediments in disposing of the huge quantities of discarded solid wastes which are continuously being generated? How do we remove safely the toxic wastes that have been accumulating in our habitable environment?

Recently Scientists have designed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner that costs a fraction of existing machines, setting the stage for improving access to this widely used diagnostic tool. So we need to know about the Electromagnet.
Invented in
1824
by
William Sturgeon
, electromagnets revolutionised technology.
Sturgeon was an
English physicist
and inventor who discovered that
wrapping a coil of wire around a piece of iron
passing an electric current through
the wire produced a magnetic field.
Electromagnets are used in Loudspeakers for sound reproduction, Motors for mechanical movement., and MRI machines for medical imaging, etc
How Electromagnets Work?
Electric
current flowing through a wire
generates a
around the wire.
Coiling
the wire enhances this magnetic field by
concentrating
it within the
coil’s core
This configuration creates an
, where the
strength
of the magnetic field is
directly proportional to the current
flowing through the coil.
magnetic flux
density
so generated is measured in ‘
Tesla’
Enhancing Magnetic Strength with a Core
Coiling the wire around a magnetic material (core), such as iron or steel:
Amplifies the magnetic field produced by the electric current.
Ferromagnetic materials like iron align their internal magnetic domains with the external magnetic field generated by the coil.
This alignment significantly increases the overall magnetic strength of the electromagnet compared to a non-magnetic core.
Persistence of Magnetization
It refers to the
property of a material
to retain a certain
amount of magnetization
even after the removal of an external magnetic field.
Certain core materials exhibit retained magnetization even after the current ceases.
residual magnetism
is useful in applications requiring sustained magnetic fields, such as:
Superconducting electromagnets used in
, are capable of producing magnetic fields up to
30 Tesla
Research electromagnets like those used in
particle physics
, which require stable and powerful magnetic fields.
Who was Michael Faraday (1791-1867)?
Michael Faraday was a pioneering English scientist and physicist who made substantial contributions to the fields of electromagnetism and electrochemistry.
Faraday is best known for his experiments and discoveries in electromagnetism, which laid the groundwork for the principles of electromagnetic induction and the laws of electrolysis.
Key achievements of Michael Faraday include:
Electromagnetic Induction:
He discovered electromagnetic induction in 1831, showing that a changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a nearby conductor.
Electrochemistry:
Faraday formulated the laws of electrolysis, which describe the quantitative relationship between the amount of material produced or consumed during electrolysis and the amount of electricity passed through the electrolyte.
Faraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction:
These laws describe the fundamental principles of generating electricity using magnetic fields, forming the basis for the development of electric generators and transformers.
Faraday Cage:
He invented the Faraday cage, a device used to block electromagnetic fields.

**********Madras High Court’s Interpretation of POSH Act, 2013
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Right to Report, POSH Act ,2013
Why in the News?
Madras HC upheld the ‘
Right to Report’
serious incidents of sexual harassment a time,
rejecting the 3-month deadline
under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act (POSH), 2013.
Long-term emotional and psychological damage on victims underscored the need for a broader application of the law.
Right to Report under POSH Act, 2013
Case Background:
The decision came while addressing a police officer’s petition to quash an enquiry report for alleged sexual assault against a female colleague.
Madras HC Reasoning:
Serious allegations leading to “grave mental trauma” and “stress” constitute a “continuing offence” under POSH, allowing victims to report and investigate at any time.
Notable Observations:
the Madras HC distinguished between isolated incidents and serious allegations like assault or molestation.
Isolated Incidents:
Must adhere to strict deadlines under POSH.
Serious Allegations:
Treated as continuous misconduct until addressed, allowing flexibility in reporting timelines due to fear of victimisation.
What is the POSH Act?
The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act was passed in 2013.
It
defined sexual harassment
, laid down the procedures for a complaint and inquiry, and the action to be taken.
It broadened the
Vishakha Guidelines
, which were already in place.
The POSH Act broadened these guidelines:
It mandated that
every employer must constitute an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)
at each office or branch with 10 or more employees.
It lays down
procedures and defines various aspects of sexual harassment
, including the aggrieved victim, who could be a woman “of any age whether employed or not”, who “alleges to have been subjected to any act of sexual harassment”.
This meant that the
rights of all women working or visiting any workplace
, in any capacity, were protected under the Act.
Definition of Sexual Harassment
Under the 2013 law, sexual harassment includes “
any one or more
of the following
unwelcome acts or behaviour
” committed directly or by implication:
Physical contact and advances
A demand or request for sexual favours
Sexually coloured remarks
Showing pornography
Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature.
The Ministry of Women & Child Development has published a Handbook on Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace with more detailed instances of
behaviour that constitutes sexual harassment
at the workplace. These include, broadly:
Sexually suggestive remarks or innuendos; serious or repeated offensive remarks; inappropriate questions or remarks about a person’s sex life
Display of sexist or offensive pictures, posters, MMS, SMS, WhatsApp, or emails
Intimidation, threats, blackmail around sexual favours; also, threats, intimidation or retaliation against an employee who speaks up about these
Unwelcome social invitations with sexual overtones, commonly seen as flirting
Unwelcome sexual advances.
Unwelcome behaviour
The Handbook says “unwelcome behaviour” is experienced
when the victim feels bad or powerless; it causes anger/sadness or negative self-esteem.
It adds unwelcome behaviour is one which is “illegal, demeaning, invading, one-sided and power based”.
Circumstances amounting to SHW
The Act mentions five circumstances that amount to sexual harassment implied or explicit:
The promise of preferential treatment in her employment
The threat of detrimental treatment
Threat about her present or future employment status
Interference with her work or creating an offensive or hostile work environment
Humiliating treatment likely to affect her health or safety
Procedure for complaint
Description
Filing a complaint
The aggrieved victim has the option to file a complaint with the ICC, but it is not compulsory for the ICC to act.
Assistance in filing a complaint
