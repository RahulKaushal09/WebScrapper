On
January 7, 2025
, a powerful earthquake of magnitude
struck the Tibetan region of China and parts of Nepal.
The epicentre was located approximately
10 km below the surface
Tingry County, Shigatse region
, around
80 km north of Mount Everest
By evening, reports confirmed at least
95 fatalities
130 injuries
, and the destruction of hundreds of houses. Tremors were felt as far as
Kathmandu (Nepal)
Thimphu (Bhutan)

Polar Vortex

Why in News?
A severe
winter storm
has affected a large part of the US, impacting over 60 million people across 30 states.
This extreme weather is attributed to the
southward expansion of the
polar vortex,
highlighting its role in causing frigid temperatures and severe storms.
Note:
Winter storms are weather events characterized by
extreme cold, snow, sleet, or freezing rain,
often accompanied by strong winds.
They form when
moist air rises, cools, and condenses into precipitation,
with cold temperatures ensuring it falls as snow or ice.
What is the Polar Vortex?
About:
The polar vortex is a large
area of low-pressure and cold air
that rotates around the
Earth’s polar regions.
The term
"vortex" describes the counter-clockwise flow of air
that confines colder air near the poles.
Polar Vortex exists year-round, but it weakens in summer and strengthens in winter.
Types:
Tropospheric Polar Vortex
: Located at the lowest layer of the atmosphere, from the
surface up to 10-15 km
, where most weather phenomena occur.
Stratospheric Polar Vortex
: Occurs higher up, between
15 km to 50 km
, and is
strongest during autumn
, disappearing in the summer.
Its changes are influenced by
air movement and heat transfer in the polar region.
During autumn, circumpolar winds accelerate, strengthening the vortex and forming a unified, rotating mass of polar air in the
stratosphere.
Mechanism of Extreme Cold:
When the
polar vortex is strong,
it keeps the jet
stream stable,
preventing cold air from moving south.
However, when the
vortex weakens,
a disrupted jet stream (a narrow band of strong winds), which usually moves in a straight line, becomes wavy, allowing Arctic air to flow farther south.
This disruption leads to
extremely low temperatures, severe storms, and extreme weather,
including snowfall and freezing rain.
Global Warming and Polar Vortex:
Researchers state that the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet, a phenomenon known as
Arctic amplification.
This reduces the
temperature gradient
(rate of change of temperature)
between the poles and the mid-latitudes
, weakening the
polar vortex.

Climate Change and African Easterly Waves
Source: DTE
Why in News?
A study published in
Communications Earth & Environment
predicts that
climate change
will increase the intensity and frequency of
extreme
flooding
in the
Sahel region,
driven by changes in
African easterly waves (AEWs)
.
What are the Key Highlights of the Study?
Increased AEW Activity
: The study predicts an increase in AEWs over the
Sahel-Sahara
by the end of 21st century
The intensification is driven by
increased baroclinicity
(variation in
atmospheric pressure and density
with height) due to a
stronger meridional temperature gradient
(difference in temperature between regions) between the Guinea Coast and the Sahara.
Enhanced Monsoon Flow:
The study found that
low-level warming reinforces monsoon flow,
increasing
convergence
(more air entering a vertical column than leaving it) and vertical motion of air along the
intertropical discontinuity ( ITD )
altering AEWs formation.
The ITD is the boundary between the
hot and dry desert air
cooler and more moist air
from the Arabian Sea.
Implications:
Saharan Dust Transport:
Strong winds from a northern track AEW (close to Sahara Desert) can transport
dry Saharan air, preventing or delaying tropical cyclogenesis
(the formation of tropical cyclones) until more favorable conditions in the warmer western Atlantic.
Connection to MCSs:
AEWs are linked to
Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs),
which cause extreme rainfall. The study suggests that increased AEW activity may
lead to more frequent and intense flooding events
in the Sahel.
What are African Easterly Waves?
Definition:
African easterly waves (AEWs) are weather systems that form over
northern Africa
during the summer and move
east to west toward the Atlantic Ocean.
Significance:
AEWs bring rainstorms to drought-prone areas in northern Africa.
Carry
Saharan dust across the Atlantic ocean
and AEWs act as precursors for
hurricanes.
Influence:
AEWs significantly affect the
regional hydroclimate,
particularly in the Sahel, making it essential to understand their behavior under global warming.

Artesian Well in Rajasthan and Tethys Sea
Source: IE
Why in News?
Recently, large amounts of
water
began
gushing out
from underground in
Jaisalmer, Rajasthan
that is attributed to the
in India.
Experts
rejected
the idea of the water being
linked
to the ancient
Saraswati river
suggesting water may be
millions of years old
, with origins from
Tethys sea
(pre-Vedic times).
What is an Artesian Well?
About:
An artesian well is a type of well in which
water rises naturally to the surface
under pressure without the need for pumping. This occurs when
water is trapped
in a
confined
aquifer
and is under significant pressure.
It is also described as “confined” water because of
hardy materials above and below it.
Formation
: Artesian wells are formed when a
well penetrates a confined aquifer
, which is a layer of
permeable rock
or sediment
sandwiched between impermeable layers like clay or rock.
Pressure Mechanism
: The water in the confined aquifer is
due to the
weight of the water above
it, and when the well is drilled, the pressure forces the water to rise through the
borehole
Water Flow
: In an artesian well, the water may
flow freely to the surface
if the pressure is sufficient, which is known as
"flowing artesian wells."
If the p
ressure is not enough
to force the water to the surface, it can be
extracted using a pump.
Locations
: Famous artesian wells are found in regions such as the
Great Artesian Basin in Australia
Dakota aquifer
in the United States, and
Africa.
Difference with Tube Wells:
Artesian water can
naturally rise to the surface
on its own and is
found deeper
beneath the earth's surface whereas
tube wells require external power
to pump water.

What are the features of Artesian Well Found in Rajasthan?
Water Eruption:
In desert regions of Rajasthan, water is
confined underneath
a geological layer of
sandstone
As soon as the top layer is
punctured
, water starts flowing upwards due to heavy pressure, often gushing out like a
fountain.
Ancient Sea Evidence
: The water found in the borewell exhibited
high salinity
that is similar to that from
ancient sea or saline groundwater sources.
The water is believed to be linked to the
, which existed
around 250 million years ago.
Presence of Marine Clay
: Along with the water,
Oozes (fine white marine clay having skeletal remains)
surfaced, further supporting the idea that the groundwater is remnants of an
ancient sea.
The sand found in the area, believed to be from the
Tertiary period (around 6 million years ago),
was also brought up with the groundwater.
Geological Significance
: The Jaisalmer region once
bordered the Tethys Sea
dinosaurs
inhabiting one side and deep waters on the other.
Giant shark fossils
have been found only in India (Jaisalmer), Japan, and Thailand in Asia.
What are the Key Facts About the Tethys Sea?
The Tethys Sea formed during the early stages of the
Mesozoic Era
, particularly during the
Triassic
(about 250 to 201 million years ago).
It was located between the landmasses of
Gondwana
(the southern supercontinent) and
Laurasia
(the northern supercontinent).
Gondwanaland incorporated present-day
South America, Africa, Arabia, Madagascar, India, Australia, and Antarctica.
Laurasia included
North America, Europe, and Asia (except peninsular India).
Geographic Extent
: The Tethys Sea extended across what is now parts of
Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East
and connected the
Pacific Ocean
in the east and the
Atlantic Ocean
in the west.
Closure:
By the
Late Cretaceous
(around 66 million years ago), the Tethys Sea began to close as the
tectonic plates
continued to shift.
The remnants of the Tethys Sea can still be seen today in the form of smaller seas, like the
Mediterranean Sea
Caspian Sea
Black Sea
Tectonic Significance
: The gradual closure led to the creation of new landmasses, such as the
Indian subcontinent
moving toward the
Asian plate
, leading to the uplift of the
Himalayan mountain range
Tibetan Plateau
Fossil Evidence
: The Tethys Sea is known for being home to a rich diversity of marine life, including early forms of
sharks, ammonites
marine reptiles
ichthyosaurs
mosasaurs
The Tethys Sea's evolution helped form
petroleum basins
in North Africa and the Middle East, aiding
organic material accumulation and hydrocarbon maturation.

Conclusion
The recent gushing of water from underground in
, attributed to an artesian well, has sparked debates about its connection to the
ancient Saraswati River
. However, scientific analysis suggests that the water is from
ancient sea remnants,
specifically linked to the
Tethys Sea, rather than the Saraswati River.
Drishti Mains Question:
Discuss the concept and formation of artesian wells.
