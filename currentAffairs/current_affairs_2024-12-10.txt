DIGITAL AGRICULTURE MISSION
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Context:
Gujarat became the first State in the country to generate Farmer IDs for 25% of the targeted number of farmers in the State. The Farmer ID is part of  Digital Agriculture Mission.
Background: –
A Farmer ID is a unique digital identity of farmers based on Aadhaar, linked dynamically to the State’s land records system, which means the Farmer ID gets automatically updated with the changes in the land record details of an individual farmer.
Key provisions of the Copyright Act
The Digital Agriculture Mission is designed as an umbrella scheme to support various digital agriculture initiatives. These include creating Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), implementing the Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES), and supporting IT initiatives by the Central Government, State Governments, and Academic and Research Institutions.
The scheme is built on two foundational pillars:
Agri Stack
Krishi Decision Support System.
Additionally, the mission includes ‘Soil Profile Mapping’ and aims to enable farmer-centric digital services to provide timely and reliable information for the agriculture sector.
AgriStack: Kisan ki Pehchaan
AgriStack is designed as a farmer-centric Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) to streamline services and scheme delivery to farmers. It comprises three key components:
1. Farmers’ Registry
2. Geo-referenced village maps
3. Crop Sown Registry
A crucial feature of AgriStack is the introduction of a ‘Farmer ID’, similar to Aadhaar card, serving as a trusted digital identity for farmers.
The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) will integrate remote sensing data on crops, soil, weather, and water resources into a comprehensive geospatial system.
Under the mission, detailed soil profile maps on a 1:10,000 scale for approximately 142 million hectares of agricultural land have been envisaged, with 29 million hectares of soil profile inventory already being mapped.
The Digital Agriculture Mission focuses on grassroots implementation, targeting farmers as the primary beneficiaries.
Some of the key benefits of the mission include:
Digital authentication for accessing services and benefits, reducing paperwork and the need for physical visits.
Enhanced efficiency and transparency in government schemes, crop insurance, and loan systems through accurate data on crop area and yield.
Crop map generation and monitoring for better disaster response and insurance claims.
Development of digital infrastructure to optimize value chains and provide tailored advisory services for crop planning, health, pest management, and irrigation.

THE PLACE OF CHARITY IN AN UNEQUAL SOCIETY
Mains  – GS 2, GS 3 & GS 4
Warren Buffet has given away an amount of almost 52 billion dollars to charities. While such a move is commendable, one must also question the processes generating the concentration of such wealth in the first place, regardless of whether it is to be used for philanthropy or not
Mr. Buffet believes that wealth should be used to equalise opportunities, that the luck that favoured certain individuals and helped them get rich should be extended after one’s death in order to help those less fortunate.
Critics argue that distribution of private wealth through charity may help to equalise well-being between individuals, but the process by which this wealth was generated and concentrated has led to the differences in opportunities in the first place.
Mr. Buffet’s ideas can be seen in the context of a philosophical idea called “luck egalitarianism”, which states that no-one should have to suffer the consequences of inequality owing to bad luck or adverse situations.
Mr. Buffet credits much of his fortune to fortuitous circumstances, such as being born as a white male in the U.S.
Some might accuse Mr. Buffet of false modesty, claiming that his fortune has been generated through his own efforts and his understanding of markets. But there is truth in what he says. A significant factor driving global inequality is the differences in income between countries. Where one is born determines how wealthy one might be relative to the global population.
In the developed world, wealth distribution was largely equal during the post World War II. Widespread deregulation and a turn towards neo-liberal economics saw an explosion of inequality from the 1980s onwards, with the ‘trickle-down’ economics of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher leading to the concentration of gains for few.
In India as well, the liberalisation of the economy may have led to faster growth, but has dramatically increased inequality and skewed the distribution of opportunities.
Differences in opportunities are not merely a question of luck, but of specific policy choices and interventions. Examples:
Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos benefited from monopolistic markets.
Amazon workers faced stagnant wages despite the company’s profits.
The Role of Philanthropy:
While philanthropy can be a powerful tool for social change, it is essential to critically examine its limitations and potential drawbacks:
Band-Aid Solution: Philanthropy often addresses the symptoms of inequality rather than the root causes. It may alleviate suffering in the short term but fails to challenge the underlying systemic issues that perpetuate poverty and injustice.
Dependency Culture: Excessive reliance on philanthropy can weaken the role of the state in providing essential social services and can create a dependency culture.
Elite Capture: Philanthropic efforts can be influenced by the values and priorities of wealthy donors, potentially leading to a narrow focus on specific issues or causes.
The Need for Systemic Change:
To address the root causes of inequality, a more comprehensive approach is required:
Progressive Taxation: Implementing progressive tax policies can help redistribute wealth and fund public services.
Strong Labor Unions: Empowering workers through strong labor unions can help ensure fair wages and working conditions.
Regulation of Financial Markets: Stricter regulation of financial markets can prevent excessive wealth accumulation and reduce systemic risk.
Investment in Public Goods: Investing in public education, healthcare, and infrastructure can create opportunities for all and reduce inequality.
In conclusion, while philanthropy can be a valuable tool, it should not be seen as a substitute for systemic change. To truly address the challenges of inequality, a combination of public policy, social activism, and individual responsibility is necessary.

HEDGE AGAINST DOLLAR RELIANCE
Mains – ECONOMY
Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said recently that India is not pursuing “de-dollarisation”, and that recent measures promoting transactions in domestic currencies are intended to de-risk Indian trade.
The clarification came days after Donald Trump threatened “100 per cent tariffs” against BRICS countries if they sought to reduce reliance on the US dollar in international trade.
A key reason India is not backing de-dollarisation is the rise of the Chinese yuan as a challenger to the US dollar. India has resisted using the yuan for Russian oil imports, even as the acceptance of the currency is growing in Russia.
At the same time, India is wary of over-dependence on the dollar. The RBI has increased gold purchases in recent times.
Why are central banks on a gold-buying spree?
Central banks have increased their gold holdings sharply so as to diversify away from a dollar-dominated financial system.
The Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows a gradual decline in the share of the dollar in central bank and government foreign reserves. The gains of the yuan, especially, “match a quarter of the decline in the dollar’s share”, the IMF said.
How does the high cost of holding dollars play out in this scenario?
Depleting dollar reserves amid surging oil prices has recently caused considerable social and political unrest in India’s neighbourhood. Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan witnessed sharp declines in their dollar reserves following the Ukraine war, which upset their trade relations with India.
While India has managed to keep a robust reserve, the surging value of the dollar has become a concern.
India is pushing for trade with Russia and the UAE in domestic currencies that could help cut reliance on the US dollar. However, the domestic currency trade has not yet picked up as expected because of India’s low foothold in goods and services trade internationally.
India’s efforts toward internationalising the rupee could get a boost if oil exporters begin accepting rupee payments. But they have remained hesitant due to the high transaction costs.
A reason for the rise of the yuan has been its use in purchasing Russian oil. As China and Russia have a bilateral trade balance, both countries have been able to reduce reliance on the US dollar by successfully trading in domestic currency. India has a bilateral trade deficit with most countries except the US.

**********In Energy-Dependent World, the Issue of Food Security
Context
As emphasised by the World Bank,
the intertwined crises of food insecurity and energy poverty present one of the most significant challenges
of the 21st century.
Both sectors face individual and systemic threats
, yet their interconnected nature magnifies the complexity of the problem and the agricultural sector, critical for human survival,
simultaneously contributes to and suffers from energy dependency and climate change.
Therefore,
it is imperative to explore the strain on food and energy systems, highlighting the economic and environmental vulnerabilities
they face, and
potential pathways toward a sustainable future.
The Dual Strain on Food and Energy Systems
Impact of Climate Change
Food production and energy systems are
increasingly strained by climate change, population growth, and systemic inequalities.
Agriculture consumes nearly 70% of global freshwater
resources and contributes over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
This
sector’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels for irrigation, mechanisation
, fertiliser production, and transportation
perpetuates environmental degradation.
At the same time,
rising temperatures and erratic weather patterns disrupt agricultural output,
threatening the livelihoods of 2.5 billion people globally.
Geopolitical Challenges
Similarly,
the energy sector faces geopolitical tensions
, outdated infrastructure, and a slow transition away from fossil fuels.
Despite a $500 billion investment
in renewable energy in 2022,
short-term economic and geopolitical pressures have sustained high fossil fuel consumption.
Nations such as the
United States, Brazil, and Guyana continue expanding oil and gas production,
exacerbating energy and food system vulnerabilities.
A Detailed Analysis of Agriculture’s Fossil Fuel Dependency and Its Consequences
The Role of Fossil Fuels in Agriculture
Mechanisation, irrigation systems, and transportation networks depend on oil, diesel, and coal-based electricity.
Additionally,
fertilisers, which are critical for boosting crop yields, are predominantly produced using natural gas.
Approximately
80% of natural gas in agriculture is used as a feedstock for ammonia synthesis,
a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers, while
the remaining 20% powers the energy-intensive production process.
Price Volatility and Food System Vulnerabilities
The close link between energy prices and agricultural costs creates a cascade of vulnerabilities and
when fossil fuel prices rise, production costs for farmers increase dramatically.
Fertiliser prices are
highly sensitive to natural gas costs
, for example,
geopolitical actions such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered spikes in global energy prices
, which reverberated through agricultural supply chains.
Fertiliser costs surged, leading to increased food prices
and putting millions at risk of hunger, especially in low-income nations with limited resources to absorb such shocks.
For countries like India, which imports 60% of its diammonium phosphate (DAP)
fertilisers, this
led to delays during critical cropping seasons, undermining food security
and agricultural productivity
Environmental Consequences of Fossil Fuel Dependency
Fertiliser production and transportation are
major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
heavy use of synthetic fertilisers leads to nitrous oxide emissions
, a potent greenhouse gas, and causes soil degradation and water pollution through runoff.
Mechanised farming practices reliant on fossil fuels worsens these issues
, contributing to a vicious cycle of environmental harm and reduced long-term agricultural productivity.
Inequities in Energy Access and their Impact
The unequal access to energy systems
disproportionately affects low-income nations
, where unreliable power grids and limited resources hinder agricultural productivity.
In sub-Saharan Africa
, for instance
, fertiliser usage per hectare remains far below the global average
, contributing to chronic food insecurity.
Despite spending $1.9 billion on fertilizer imports in 2021
, double the expenditure of 2016, many
African nations remain trapped in cycles of low productivity
and high dependency on imports.
Furthermore,
the transition to renewable energy remains uneven.
High-income countries installed 83% of new renewable capacity in 2022,
leaving low-income nations dependent on outdated,
carbon-intensive systems.
While solutions like solar-powered irrigation and biomass energy hold promise for transforming agriculture, their
high costs and inadequate infrastructure limit widespread adoption in vulnerable regions.
Competing Demands on Agriculture and Economic and Environmental Costs of Inaction
In addition to feeding a growing global population,
agriculture faces the added responsibility of supporting the energy transition through biofuel production.
dual role often pits food security against energy needs
, as biofuel cultivation consumes vast land and water resources.
With nearly 12% of the global population experiencing hunger
, prioritising energy production over food
raises ethical questions.
Ensuring basic caloric needs for the world’s most vulnerable populations would require $90 billion annually until 2030
, while transforming global food systems could cost $300 billion to $400 billion annually, just 0.5% of global GDP.
However,
for low-income nations, these figures are staggering
, often surpassing 95% of GDP in some cases.
Food insecurity could cost the global economy trillions in lost productivity
and adverse health outcomes,
while climate-induced energy disruptions threaten to destabilise entire regions.
For example,
Africa’s mineral wealth, critical for renewable energy technologies, is often extracted without benefiting local economies
, perpetuating poverty, and underdevelopment.
Way Forward to a Sustainable Future
A Call for Inclusive Solutions
Despite record investments in renewable energy,
the expansion of fossil fuels continues unabated, compounding environmental and economic costs.
To address these intertwined crises effectively,
clean energy solutions must overcome structural barriers to inclusivity, ensuring that vulnerable communities are not left behind.
Renewable energy technologies like solar-powered irrigation and decentralised biomass systems offer opportunities
for sustainable agricultural transformation but
require targeted investments and infrastructure development.
Reimagining Agriculture for a Sustainable Future
twin crises of food and energy insecurity demand a fundamental shift
in global priorities.
Agriculture must be reimagined as a cornerstone of sustainable development
rather than merely a source of sustenance.
Achieving this vision requires significant investments in renewable energy, equitable resource distribution
, and the inclusion of marginalized communities in decision-making processes.
Breaking the Fossil Fuel Dependency
Addressing agriculture’s reliance on fossil fuels
requires a multi-faceted approach. Transitioning to renewable energy sources is crucial.
Technologies like solar-powered irrigation systems, wind-driven farm equipment, and decentralised biomass energy production hold the potential to revolutionise agricultural practices.
For instance, solar-powered pumps can reduce the dependence on diesel for irrigation
, while biogas plants can convert agricultural waste into sustainable energy.
Conclusion
Agriculture’s dependence on fossil fuels is a pressing issue that threatens food security,
exacerbates economic inequalities, and accelerates environmental degradation.
As the clock ticks,
the question remains: will the world rise to meet this moment of unprecedented challenge and opportunity?
By addressing food and energy insecurity
as interconnected priorities,
humanity can chart a course toward a more equitable and sustainable future.

**********The Friction Between RBI Governors and the Indian Government
Why in News?
As Shaktikanta Das concludes his tenure as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on December 10, his leadership witnessed a familiar tension between the central bank and the government.
This friction,
particularly over monetary policy decisions
, echoes a longstanding history of conflicts between successive RBI Governors and governments.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Historical Context - Tensions Between RBI Governors and Governments
Key Issues During Shaktikanta Das’ Tenure - Policy Rate Standoff
Recurring Themes in RBI-Government Conflicts
The 26th RBI Governor
Conclusion
Historical Context - Tensions Between RBI Governors and Governments:
YV Reddy (2003-2008):
Conflicts with Finance Ministry:
Reddy faced disagreements with then-Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, particularly over the development of financial markets and a controversial farm loan waiver of ₹60,000 crores.
Foreign exchange reserves debate:
Reddy opposed utilising India’s growing forex reserves for government-backed lending without guarantees, ensuring fiscal prudence.
D Subbarao (2008-2013):
Resistance to cheerleading:
Subbarao frequently clashed with Finance Ministers Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee over the
RBI’s anti-inflation stance
, which was perceived as a barrier to growth.
Creation of FSDC:
Subbarao opposed the formation of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC), arguing it undermined the RBI’s role in maintaining financial stability.
Raghuram Rajan (2013-2016):
Advocating independence:
He strongly defended the RBI’s
autonomy
resisting government moves to shift money market regulation to SEBI.
He famously emphasised the importance of the RBI’s ability to say “
No
.”
Demonetisation disapproval:
Rajan advised caution on demonetisation, warning of the costs and preparation required.
His recommendations were not heeded, and his term ended shortly before the policy was implemented.
Urjit Patel (2016-2018):
Surplus transfer dispute:
Patel resisted the government’s attempt to tap into the RBI’s excess reserves, leading to escalating tensions.
Resignation:
Citing personal reasons, Patel resigned amid increasing government pressure, notably after the invocation of
Section 7 of the RBI Act
to influence policy.
of RBI Act of 1934 gives the central government the power to direct the RBI on matters of public interest.
Key Issues During Shaktikanta Das’ Tenure - Policy Rate Standoff:
Despite government pressure to cut key policy rates to address GDP slowdown, the RBI maintained the repo rate at 6.50% to control inflation.
This decision, opposed by Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal,
highlighted the central bank’s prioritisation of inflation management over growth stimulation.
Recurring Themes in RBI-Government Conflicts:
Autonomy of the central bank:
Governments often push for accommodative monetary policies, while RBI Governors prioritise inflation control and fiscal discipline.
Interest rate policies
: Disagreements frequently arise over interest rate cuts, as governments aim to spur growth, while the RBI remains cautious about inflationary risks.
Regulatory jurisdiction:
Conflicts over the RBI’s regulatory authority, including disputes on financial market reforms and surplus reserves, underscore tensions in governance.
Diverging priorities:
While governments focus on immediate economic growth and political considerations, the RBI emphasises long-term economic stability.
The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet gave its nod for the selection of the 56-year-old
Sanjay Malhotra
(currently Revenue Secretary in the Finance Ministry) as the 26th RBI Governor with effect from December 11 for a period of three years.
Conclusion:
The tension between the RBI and the government
reflects the delicate balance of ensuring monetary policy autonomy while addressing fiscal and economic imperatives
As Shaktikanta Das’ tenure ends, this enduring dynamic underscore the
critical role of the RBI in safeguarding financial stability against political pressures.

**********On Reforms in Merchant Shipping
Why in news?
The Government plans to introduce the
Merchant Shipping Bill, 2024
and the
Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024
to drive reforms and bring transformative changes aimed at boosting the shipping industry.
What’s in today’s article?
Need for new bill
Features of the Merchant Shipping Bill
Focus on coastal shipping
Need for a new bill
Merchant Shipping Act, 1958
, and the
Coasting Vessels Act, 1838
, which the new bills aim to repeal, are outdated and fail to address the contemporary needs of the merchant marine sector.
Significant regulatory gaps exist, particularly for vessels operating in the offshore sector, comprising nearly 50% of Indian-flagged vessels.
Furthermore, maritime training was liberalised allowing private sector participation, yet
there is no legal framework in the existing Act to regulate their activities effectively
Welfare provisions in the Merchant Shipping Act are limited to Indian-flagged ships, though 85% of Indian seafarers work on foreign-flagged vessels.
The existing Act lacks enabling provisions for implementing international conventions signed or planned by India.
License-era provisions hinder modernization, preventing maritime administration from transitioning to a regulator-cum-facilitator model.
Expanded vessel scope
The existing Act regulates only large mechanized ships, leaving smaller and non-mechanized vessels unregulated, creating operational and safety risks in the offshore sector.
India’s offshore drilling sector gained prominence in 1974 when
Sagar Samrat
, a merchant vessel designed for exploratory offshore drilling, drilled the first well in Bombay High.
Since then, the offshore sector has employed a diverse range of mechanised and non-mechanised vessels.
However, these vessels remain either unregulated or inadequately regulated
The new Bill addresses this by expanding the definition of 'vessels' to include a wide range of crafts, such as submersibles, hydrofoils, and Mobile Offshore Units (MOUs), ensuring comprehensive oversight and enhanced transparency.
Foreign investment
Lowers the ownership threshold for Indian entities from 100% to 51%, enabling NRIs, OCIs, and foreign entities to invest while maintaining majority Indian ownership.
Bareboat charter-cum-demise
The Bill allows the registration of vessels chartered by Indian entities under the bareboat charter-cum-demise, enabling entrepreneurs to acquire ownership of vessels at the end of the charter period.
A bareboat charter-cum-demise is a maritime contract where a vessel is leased without crew or provisions, with the intention that ownership will transfer to the charterer after a set period, functioning like a lease-to-own arrangement for the ship.
This provision, particularly beneficial for capital-deficient entrepreneurs, facilitates entry into the shipping industry without upfront investment.
Provisions for temporary registration of vessels destined for demolition
India, the second-largest ship recycling center after Bangladesh, faces challenges in registering vessels for demolition as they are often deemed unseaworthy.
The Merchant Shipping Bill introduces provisions for temporary registration of such vessels, aiming to boost activities at recycling hubs like Alang.
Enhancing coastal security
The 26/11 Mumbai attacks highlighted gaps in maritime security, emphasizing the need for stricter vessel regulations.
The new Bill empowers authorities to issue instructions to all vessel types, enhancing coastal security and safeguarding India’s coastline.
Marine Pollution Measures
Reduction of sulphur content in marine fuel to less than 0.5%.
Ban on single-use plastics on Indian ships.
Launch of the ‘Swachh Sagar’ portal for ship waste disposal at ports.
The new Bill fully incorporates international conventions like MARPOL and the Wreck Removal Convention, aligning India's maritime regulations with global standards and promoting sustainable shipping practices.
Provisions for Seafarers
Indian seafarers on foreign-flagged ships have grown significantly, from 1,16,000 in 2015-16 to 2,85,000, representing 85% of the workforce.
The existing Act lacks provisions for the welfare and safety of this vast workforce working on foreign-flagged vesels.
The new Bill addresses gaps in welfare and safety provisions for these seafarers by extending government welfare measures and protections under the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), ensuring better working conditions and safety standards.
Provision for
The Union Government is responsible for regulating maritime education and training under
Entry 25 of List 1 (Union List) of the Constitution
Previously, training was managed by government-run institutions, so no specific legal framework was needed.
However, with economic liberalization has allowed unauthorized institutes to thrive, complicating regulatory actions.
The proposed Bill introduces clear legal provisions to regulate maritime training, aiming to eliminate illegal institutes and ensure high-quality, standardized education, protecting rural youth from exploitation.
Distinguishing Technical Regulation and Commercial Utilisation
The Government has separated the technical regulation of ships from the commercial use of Indian coastal waters.
Licensing, operational permissions, coastal planning, and integration of inland and coastal shipping are now part of the proposed
It has removed the provisions related to the commercial utilisation of Indian coastal waters from the Merchant Shipping Act.
The Merchant Shipping Act will focus on technical regulation of ships
Alignment with ‘Sagarmala’ Program
The new Bill supports the Government’s
‘Sagarmala’ program
, which promotes coastal shipping through dedicated berths and better hinterland connectivity for coastal cargo.
This approach is essential for infrastructure growth and a strong regulatory framework.
Conclusion
The reforms are intended to be bipartisan, focusing on investment, safety, marine pollution prevention, and seafarers' welfare. These measures are aimed at unlocking the full potential of India’s maritime sector.

Opposition's Grievances
Accusations of partisanship against Dhankhar have been building.
This was significant after he named Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi in the context of alleged currency recovery.
Recently, Rajya Sabha Chairman announced in the House that “a wad of currency notes” was recovered from a seat allotted to Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi.
There are claims that the ruling party and its government are undermining constitutional offices and parliamentary democracy.
No Precedent for Chairman Impeachment
There is no precedent for moving an impeachment or no-confidence resolution against the Rajya Sabha Chairman.
A similar no-confidence resolution was moved against Deputy Chairman Harivansh in 2020 over procedural disagreements regarding contentious farm Bills.
Historical Context
Past instances of resolutions against
Lok Sabha Speakers
include G V Mavalankar (1951), Sardar Hukam Singh (1966), and Balram Jakhar (1987).
These were all discussed and negated by the House.

**********Under Trump 2.0, the world and the India outlook
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Bilateral Relations; India-USA relations;
Why in the News?
After the recent Elections, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will likely hold a more favourable view of India compared to other nations.
What are the potential impacts of Trump’s protectionist trade policies on India?
Increased Tariffs:
Trump’s administration is likely to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports, which could lead to a shift in trade dynamics.
India might benefit from this situation as companies look to relocate their manufacturing bases away from China, potentially increasing Indian exports.
Supply Chain Diversification:
As U.S. firms seek to diversify their supply chains to reduce dependency on China, India could emerge as an attractive alternative for manufacturing and technology services, boosting economic ties between the two nations.
Pressure on Indian Goods:
Conversely, if Trump’s policies lead to retaliatory measures from China or other countries, Indian goods may face increased scrutiny or tariffs in those markets, affecting India’s export competitiveness.
How will Trump’s immigration policies affect the Indian workforce in the US?
H-1B Visa Restrictions:
Trump’s administration may implement stricter immigration policies, particularly affecting H-1B visas commonly used by Indian IT professionals. This could limit the ability of Indian workers to enter or remain in the U.S. job market.
Talent Drain:
Stricter immigration laws might lead to a talent drain, where highly skilled Indian professionals seek opportunities in other countries with more favorable immigration policies, impacting India’s tech sector.
Focus on Skilled Workers:
On the flip side, if Trump prioritizes skilled labor that aligns with U.S. economic needs, there could be opportunities for Indian professionals who meet those criteria to gain entry into the U.S. market.
What strategic opportunities and challenges will arise for India in the Indo-Pacific region?
Strengthened Alliances:
Under Trump’s leadership, India is likely to see strengthened ties with the U.S. and other allies like Japan and Australia through frameworks such as the Quad, which aims to counterbalance China’s influence in the region.
Defence Cooperation:
Enhanced defence cooperation could lead to increased military sales and joint exercises between India and the U.S., bolstering India’s defence capabilities against regional threats.
Balancing Relations with China:
While India may benefit from a closer relationship with the U.S., it will need to navigate its complex relationship with China carefully. Increased tensions between the U.S. and China could put India in a difficult position regarding its economic and security interests.
Regional Stability Challenges:
Trump’s assertive foreign policy might lead to greater instability in the Indo-Pacific region. India will need to manage its responses carefully to maintain peace while pursuing its strategic interests.
Way forward:
Leverage Strategic Partnerships
: India should capitalize on strengthened ties with the U.S. and allies like Japan and Australia to enhance its defence, trade, and technology capabilities while maintaining a robust independent foreign policy to balance regional dynamics.
Promote Domestic Resilience
: By advancing initiatives like “Make in India” and diversifying export markets, India can reduce reliance on vulnerable sectors impacted by U.S. protectionism and prepare to attract global supply chains shifting away from China.
Mains PYQ:
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is transforming itself into a trade bloc from a military alliance, in present times Discuss.

**********Indians need the right to disconnect
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to women;
Why in the News?
After an EY employee’s death allegedly linked to work pressure, a report highlights Indian women in professions like IT and auditing exceeding 55-hour workweeks, with marginalized unorganized sector workers facing varied hours.
What are the present issues arising at Workplaces in India?
Long Working Hours:
Many Indian professionals, especially women in sectors like auditing and IT, work over 55 hours per week, contributing to high levels of stress and burnout.
Mental Health Impact:
A significant percentage (49%) of Indian workers report that workplace stress negatively affects their mental health, highlighting the urgent need for better work-life balance.
Lack of Legal Protections:
Unlike several countries that have implemented laws to protect employees’ right to disconnect from work outside official hours, India lacks specific legislation addressing this issue.
Cultural Attitudes:
There is a pervasive workaholic culture where employees feel compelled to remain available outside working hours, often leading to a blurring of boundaries between personal and professional life.
What benefits and challenges would India face in enforcing a ‘right to disconnect’ law?
Benefits:
Improved Employee Well-Being:
Enforcing a right to disconnect could help mitigate stress and improve mental health among employees, leading to a healthier workforce.
Enhanced Productivity:
Research indicates that allowing employees to disconnect can lead to increased productivity during working hours as they can focus better without after-hours distractions.
Work-Life Balance:
Such legislation would promote a more balanced approach to work, allowing employees to prioritize personal time and family life.
Challenges:
Economic Concerns:
Implementing a right to disconnect may b e seen as detrimental to economic growth in a competitive landscape like India, where companies often push for extended working hours.
Resistance from Employers:
Many employers may resist such regulations, fearing it could hinder their operational flexibility and responsiveness.
Cultural Shift Required:
There would need to be a significant cultural shift within organizations to embrace the right to disconnect, moving away from the expectation of constant availability.
How does the concept align with India’s economic growth and competitive landscape?
Boosting Productivity:
Recognizing the right to disconnect could enhance overall productivity by fostering a healthier work environment. This aligns with India’s goal of becoming the third-largest economy by 2030.
Attracting Talent:
A commitment to employee well-being through such legislation could make Indian companies more attractive to skilled professionals, particularly in competitive sectors like technology.
Global Competitiveness:
As global standards for employee rights evolve, India risks falling behind if it does not adapt its labor laws. Implementing a right to disconnect could position India favorably in the global market.
Way forward:
Legislative Framework:
Introduce comprehensive laws recognizing the right to disconnect, ensuring strict enforcement mechanisms and sector-specific guidelines to accommodate diverse workplace needs while safeguarding employee well-being.
Cultural Transformation:
Promote awareness campaigns and organizational policies to shift workplace culture towards respecting personal time, emphasizing the long-term benefits of work-life balance for productivity and economic growth.
