Decoding the Debate on PM Modi and Chandrachud’s Display of Faith
Context
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi
, celebrated with enthusiasm across the country,
is a vivid example of how faith, culture, and collective spirit can unite people
across regional and social divides.
However,
in modern times, even festivals can become the subject of controversy
, as seen in recent
debates over the celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud.
This
incident highlights not just the deep cultural traditions of the nation
but also how personal and institutional interactions are
perceived in today's political climate.
Significance of Ganesh Chaturthi and Transformation of the Festival into a Public Celebration
Historical and Cultural Roots of Ganesh Chaturthi
Ganesh Chaturthi’s
origins can be traced back to ancient India
, where it was celebrated in a more private, familial setting.
in the 19th century, the festival took on a new dimension
during the Indian independence movement.
Bal Gangadhar Tilak,
one of India’s foremost freedom fighters, transformed the celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi from a private ritual into a large public event.
His intent was to use the festival as a means to unite Indians across caste, religious, and regional lines in their common struggle against British colonial rule.
By
bringing people together in public spaces for prayers, processions
, and performances, Tilak envisioned the
festival as a platform for social and political solidarity.
Regional and National Celebrations: A Pan-Indian Festival
Ganesh Chaturthi is
celebrated with equal fervour from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the coastal temples of Tamil Nadu.
It is a truly pan-Indian festival, cutting across regional divides to engage millions of people across the country.
In Maharashtra, the state with the largest celebrations, large idols of Lord Ganesha are installed in public spaces,
neighbourhoods, and homes.
These idols, often handcrafted and decorated elaborately, become the focal point of community prayers and gatherings.
Processions, music, dance, and community feasts are organised, with people from all walks of life participating in the festivities.
Inclusivity Beyond Religion: A Social and Civic Occasion
One of the most remarkable aspects of
Ganesh Chaturthi is its ability to transcend religious boundaries.
Though rooted in Hindu worship, the festival has evolved into a social and civic occasion where people from all religions and backgrounds participate
in various aspects of the celebration.
The inclusivity of the festival is evident in the way neighbourhoods and communities organise events that welcome everyone, regardless of faith or cultural identity.
An Analysis of Institutional Integrity and Personal Relations
Critics of the Modi-Chandrachud meeting argue that
such interactions undermine democratic traditions or raise questions about institutional independence.
these concerns overlook the rich history of personal interactions
between Indian leaders, both judicial and executive.
Historically,
such relationships have not only existed but have often contributed to the better functioning of democracy.
late jurist Fali Nariman once remarked that Chief Justice M.C. Chagla of the Bombay High Court and then Chief Minister Morarji Desai used to meet regularly to discuss issues.
Similarly,
CJI Balakrishnan attended an Iftar party hosted by former PM Manmohan Singh without attracting controversy.
The Dangers of Politicising Personal Interactions
Erosion of Public Trust in Democratic Institutions
Democracies are built on trust — trust in elected representatives,
the judiciary, and the democratic processes that bind the system together.
public relies on these institutions to function independently
, maintaining a balance of power and ensuring that justice, governance, and law are upheld.
When personal interactions between the judiciary and executive are politicised,
it erodes public trust in these very institutions.
Undermining Democratic Functioning
Politicising personal interactions
between members of the judiciary and executive
can also weaken the functionality of democracy itself.
Democracy thrives on the principle of
separation of powers
, where the executive, legislature, and judiciary operate independently but must also interact and collaborate when necessary.
Interactions between these branches are not only normal but essential
for the healthy functioning of governance.
when such interactions are framed as politically suspicious or morally dubious, they can lead to unnecessary friction
between institutions.
This undermines the ability of leaders to engage in dialogue and resolve issues collaboratively.
Creating Divisive Narratives and Social Polarisation
The politicisation of personal interactions is
not just limited to institutional harm; it can also contribute to social polarisation.
critics politicize moments of personal connection, especially during cultural or religious events like Ganesh Chaturthi, they exploit these moments
to create divisive narratives that deepen societal rifts.
In India,
where religious and cultural festivals often bring communities together, politicising such events only serves to alienate groups and amplify differences.
Dehumanising Public Figures
By scrutinising the Ganesh Chaturthi celebration between the PM and the CJI,
critics fail to recognise that, outside their roles as public figures, these individuals are human beings with personal traditions, faiths, and relationships.
tendency to politicise their every action risk turning them into depersonalised figures
whose every move is interpreted as a political calculation.
This process of dehumanisation disconnects leaders from the public
, making it difficult for citizens to relate to or trust them on a personal level.
Conclusion
The celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi by PM Modi and CJI Chandrachud serves as a potent reminder of the strength of Indian democratic institutions
and the importance of personal relationships in fostering a healthy democracy.
Instead of questioning the integrity of such interactions,
we should focus on celebrating the shared traditions that unite us.
Festivals, after all, are meant to bring people together,
and it is in this spirit that India can continue to thrive as a diverse, democratic nation.

**********The Great Stupa of Sanchi
Why in News?
During his recent visit to Germany, the External Affairs Minister of India paid a visit to the replica of Sanchi's Great Stupa's East Gate standing in front of Humboldt Forum Museum in Berlin.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is a Stupa?
The East Gate of the Sanchi Stupa and its Replica
Meaning:
In Buddhism, a stupa is a mound-like or hemispherical structure containing relics (typically the remains of Buddha and other Buddhist monks or nuns) that is used as a place of meditation.
Origin:
Stupas were pre-Buddhist burial mounds in ancient India. They had no religious significance and were simply memorials that were less elaborate and conspicuous than they are today.
Structure:
Development:
Expansion under Ashoka (250 BCE):
According to Buddhist tradition, Emperor Ashoka recovered the relics of the Buddha from the earlier stupas and erected 84,000 stupas to distribute the relics across India.
Decorated stupas (from 125 BCE):
Stupas were soon to be richly decorated with sculptural reliefs.
For example,
Bharhut (115 BCE), Bodh Gaya (60 BCE), Mathura (125–60 BCE), Sanchi (for the elevation of the toranas), etc.
Development in Gandhara (3rd century BCE - 5th century CE):
Since Buddhism spread to Central Asia, China, Korea and Japan through Gandhara, the stylistic evolution of the Gandharan stupa was very influential.
Significance:
It is thought that the
temple
in the shape of a truncated pyramid may have derived from the design of the stepped stupas that developed in Gandhara. The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya is one such example.
The Great Stupa of Sanchi:
About:
Commissioned in the
3rd century BCE by Emperor Ashoka
, it is the oldest stone structure in India and is considered one of the best-preserved groups of Buddhist monuments in the country.
It was built over the relics of Buddha and his two disciples -
Sariputra and Maudgalyayan.
The most recent construction in Sanchi can be dated to as late as the 12th century CE, after which the site was abandoned.
British General Henry
Taylor
rediscovered the Sanchi Stupa in
1818
and Alexander Cunningham led the first formal survey and excavations at Sanchi in 1851.
The site was restored to its present condition by ASI director-general John Marshall in the 1910s with funding from the begums of nearby Bhopal.
It was designated as a
UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1989.
Location:
It is located on a hilltop at Sanchi Town in Raisen District of the State of
Madhya Pradesh
It provides a broad and instructive field for researching the origins, development, and decline of Buddhist art and architecture in India.
Gateways/ Toranas of the Great Stupa
While the original stupa was a plain hemispherical structure crowned by a chhatra (parasol),
the 4 ornamental gateways or toranas
(oriented to the four cardinal directions) were constructed in the first century BCE
These were constructed within a few decades of each other during the reign of the
Satavahana
These gateways are made of two square pillars adorned with beautiful sculptures depicting scenes from the Buddha’s life (not the Buddha in his human form) and stories from the
Jataka
The art impresses immensely by its rhythm, symmetry, visual splendour and exquisite treatment of the flower and plant elements.
The East Gate of the Sanchi Stupa and its Replica:
Features:
The upper architrave of the gate
represents the seven Manushi Buddhas (previous Buddhas, with the historical Buddha being the latest incarnation).
The middle architrave
depicts the scene of the Great Departure, when prince Siddhartha leaves Kapilavastu to live as an ascetic in search of enlightenment.
The lower architrave
depicts Emperor Ashoka visiting the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment.
Other decorative elements
include the shalabhanjika (a fertility emblem represented by a yakshi grasping the branch of a tree), elephants, winged lions, and peacocks.
Why is the East Gate the most famous of the Sanchi toranas in Europe?
There is a
historical reason
behind this. The East Gate was cast in plaster by Lieutenant Henry Hardy Cole for the Victoria and Albert Museum (London, UK) in the late 1860s.
Later, this cast was replicated and displayed all over Europe. The latest Berlin replica too traces its origin to this original cast.

**********Dissolution of Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS)
Why in news?
The Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has dissolved the 14-member Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS), led by economist Pronab Sen.
The government informed the members that the committee's work overlapped with that of the
Steering Committee for National Sample Surveys
, chaired by Rajeeva Laxman Karandikar. This overlap was cited as the reason for dismantling the SCoS.
What’s in today’s article?
Statistical system of India
New committee replacing SCoS
Statistical System of India
About
It is responsible for collecting, processing, analyzing, and disseminating data crucial for planning, policy-making, and governance.
It is a decentralized system, with responsibilities shared between the Central and State governments, covering a wide array of sectors including economics, agriculture, industry, demography, and health.
Constitutional Division of Responsibilities
India's Statistical System is
influenced by the constitutional division of powers between the Union, State, and Concurrent Lists, as outlined in the 7th Schedule
Each govt department or ministry, whether at the central or state level, is generally responsible for the collection of statistics related to its specific subject area.
E.g., - For education or labor welfare, mentioned in concurrent list, both the Union and the States may gather statistics.
But typically, the central agencies work in collaboration with state bodies to avoid duplication and ensure uniformity.
Institutions involved
Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)
Came into existence as an Independent Ministry in 1999 after the merger of the Dept of Statistics and the Dept of Programme Implementation.
National Statistical Office (NSO)
It is responsible for planning and coordinating the integrated development of the national statistical system.
It was formed in 2019 by merging the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and the Central Statistical Office (CSO).
National Statistical Commission (NSC
Created on the recommendation of Rangarajan Commission, it was established to ensure statistical quality and credibility.
It acts as an advisory body to improve the statistical system in India.
Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
Plays a role in collecting banking and financial statistics for policy and economic analysis.
State Statistical Bureaus (SSBs)
Each state has its own statistical departments that collaborate with central agencies to ensure data consistency.
Regulatory Framework
The Collection of Statistics Act, 2008
- Governs the collection of statistics across various sectors.
Census Act, 1948
- Governs the decennial Census of India, a major source of demographic and socio-economic data.
Challenges:
Data Quality and Timeliness
Concerns have been raised about the accuracy and timeliness of data, especially given delays in critical surveys like the decennial Census.
Capacity Constraints
State statistical agencies often lack adequate manpower, funding, and infrastructure, which hinders efficient data collection and processing.
Coordination Issues
Decentralized nature leads to coordination challenges between central and state statistical bodies, impacting data uniformity and integration.
Technological Adoption
While digitization efforts have been undertaken, there is a need for more advanced data collection and processing technologies to improve efficiency and accuracy.
Political Interference
Allegations of political pressure and manipulation of data, especially in areas like unemployment and GDP, have affected the credibility of official statistics.
Lack of Uniformity
Different methods used by various departments can lead to inconsistencies in data collection and reporting.
Recent controversy
The Centre has been claiming that data provided by the EPFO, ESIC on its enrolments and Reserve Bank of India’s KLEMS (K: Capital, L: Labour, E: Energy, M: Materials and S: Services) database gave a rosy picture about the employment scenario in the country.
However, questions have been raised as administration data, especially on labour, is threshold-based.
It is alleged that such data was airing the perspectives of policy architects or reflecting the government’s intentions.
The chances of manipulating the administration data set were also high as government agencies generated that data.
It is also argued that such data has limitations of analytical rigour.
On the other hand, survey-based data, including the census, has universal coverage without any thresholds, providing a wider and bigger platform
Background
The Government had formed Standing Committee on Economic Statistics (SCES) in December 2019.
In July 2023, the SCES was renamed as SCoS to advise on all surveys as and when required by MoSPI.
Function
SCoS advised the government on survey methodologies, including sampling design, survey instruments, and questions.
It played a key role in finalizing survey tabulation plans, reviewing existing frameworks, and addressing issues related to survey results and methodologies.
The SCoS was also tasked with guiding pilot surveys, exploring administrative statistics, identifying data gaps, recommending additional data requirements, and providing technical guidance to central and state agencies for conducting surveys.
The newly formed Steering Committee, replacing the SCoS, has 17 members and one non-member secretary.
Its two-year tenure and Terms of Reference are similar to the SCoS, including reviewing survey results, methodology, sampling design, and finalizing the tabulation plan for National Sample Surveys.
The main difference between the two committees lies in their composition,
with the Steering Committee having more official members, while the SCoS had a higher number of non-official members, leading to some overlap in their mandates

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS)
Mains level:
SCoS and Steering Committee;
Why in the News?
The Union Ministry dissolved the
headed by eminent economist and former chief statistician of the country
Pronab Sen
citing overlapping roles with the Steering Committee.
Why was the SCoS dissolved?
Overlapping Responsibilities:
The primary reason cited for the dissolution of the SCoS was that its
functions overlapped
with those of the newly formed
Steering Committee for National Sample Surveys.
Concerns Raised by Members:
Members of the SCoS had
consistently questioned the delay in conducting the census,
which has been a critical source of data for policymakers.
Lack of Communication:
Dr. Pronab Sen, the chair of the SCoS, noted that
members were not provided with a specific reason for the committee’s dissolution,
which raised concerns about transparency in the decision-making process.
What are the main roles of the new Steering Committee?
Advisory Role:
The Steering Committee will
advise the Ministry on survey methodologies
, including aspects like sampling frames, design, and survey instruments,
similar to the SCoS.
Finalizing Tabulation Plans:
This will play a crucial role in finalizing the
tabulation plans for various national sample surveys,
ensuring that the data collected is organized and presented effectively.
Reviewing Methodologies:
The committee will review
subject results, methodologies, and questionnaires
related to national sample surveys, maintaining the continuity of statistical rigor established by the SCoS.
Tenure and Composition:
The Steering Committee consists of
17 members, including at least four members retained from the SCoS
, and will serve a
tenure of two years
How do the SCoS and the Steering Committee differ?
The Steering Committee has a
higher number of official members compared to the SCoS,
which includes several non-official members. This shift may influence the dynamics and perspectives within the committee.
Mandate Overlap:
While both committees have similar mandates regarding survey methodologies and data collection, the Steering Committee is positioned to
focus more on the operational aspects of national sample surveys
, potentially leading to a more streamlined approach.
Response to Criticism:
The formation of the Steering Committee appears to be a response to criticisms of the statistical system in India, aiming to
address survey-related issues more effectively than the SCoS could.
How does the SCoS’s dissolution impact statistical data quality?
Delay in Census Data:
The dissolution of the SCoS amid ongoing delays in conducting the census raises concerns about the
availability of reliable and updated data
. The
last census was conducted in 2011, and reliance on outdated data
can negatively affect policy-making and the distribution of welfare benefits.
Quality of Administrative Data:
Critics argue that
administrative data,
which the government has been relying on,
may not accurately reflect the employment scenario,
as it is often threshold-based and susceptible to manipulation. This could lead to a distorted view of the economic situation.
Need for Comprehensive Data:
The census is crucial for
providing comprehensive demographic, economic, and social data
, which is essential for effective policy formulation. The absence of
updated census data
hinder
the government’s ability to
address issues like employment, poverty, and social welfare effectively.
Way forward:
Reinstate Independent Oversight
: Establish an independent statistical body with clear roles to ensure transparency, timely data collection, and oversight of key surveys like the census, addressing concerns of data reliability.
Modernize Data Collection
: Leverage technology to streamline and accelerate the census and national surveys, ensuring that updated and accurate data is available for policy-making and welfare distribution.
**********Is it time for India to introduce a Universal Basic Income?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Impact of automation on the Indian economy;
Why in the News?
The rise in jobless growth, driven by automation and AI, has led to growing inequality, prompting discussions on implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI) in many countries.
What does the ILO say on Inflation and unemployment in India?
The ILO reports that
83% of the unemployed population in India
are youth, due to the rapidly changing economy influenced by automation and AI.
This trend has exacerbated income inequality, with a
1.6% drop in global labour income share between 2004 and 2024,
significantly affecting developing nations like India.
The report indicates that persistent inflation and
geopolitical tensions have led to aggressive monetary policies,
which could further strain the labor market.
The ILO anticipates a
slight increase in global unemployment in 2024
, reflecting ongoing structural issues in labor markets.
What will be its implications on Indian growth and development?
Social Implications
: Falling living standards and weak productivity due to automation could lead to greater inequality, undermining social justice efforts in India.
The ILO suggests that increasing unemployment and inflation could result in social unrest and political instability without effective social safety nets.
Political Implications:
It makes it difficult for the decision making and governance due to the drop in global labour income, prompting India to increase budget allocations for welfare programs.
Economic Implications:
The emphasis on generating employment in labor-intensive sectors is crucial. The government policies should prioritize job creation to counteract the effects of automation and ensure that growth benefits a broader segment of the population.
What are the safety nets for India?
Cash Transfer Schemes:
Programs targeting farmers and women,
as well as cash transfers for unemployed youth,
represent existing safety nets that provide some level of income support.
Employment Guarantee Schemes:
Initiatives like the
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)
aim to provide employment and income security to rural households, although funding and implementation have faced challenges.
Universal Basic Social Safety Nets:
Experts suggest that rather than a full UBI,
India should focus on enhancing existing social safety nets
to ensure they are more
universal and effective
in addressing the needs of the unemployed and underemployed populations.
