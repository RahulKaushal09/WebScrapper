Supreme Court’s Landmark Judgment on Child Marriages in India
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
About Child Marriage (Data, Legal Framework, Court’s Judgement, Significance, etc.)
Conclusion
Background:
In a recent ground-breaking ruling in the
Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action v. Union of India
case, the
has shifted the focus on child marriages from criminal prosecution to addressing the harm and challenges faced by victims.
The Court laid out comprehensive guidelines aimed at strengthening the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) and highlighted the crucial role of state governments in enforcing these measures.
The judgment emphasizes that efforts to tackle child marriage should not only focus on prevention and punishment but also on empowering those already in child marriages to reclaim their independence.
Child Marriages in India:
According to the
National Family Health Survey (NFHS)
, the percentage of women aged 20-24 who were married before 18 has declined significantly from 47.4% in 2005 to 23.3% in 2021.
Despite this progress, India is far from achieving the
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
of completely eradicating child marriage by 2030.
Institutional Approach:
Efforts have traditionally focused on prevention and, more recently, on prosecution.
For instance, in Assam, the authorities took mass action by arresting men who were found married to minors.
However, criminal prosecution alone might not address the complexities surrounding child marriage, especially in cases where young individuals marry to escape challenging situations.
Legal Framework for Child Marriage in India:
Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA)
Defines child marriage as a marriage where either the husband is under 21 or the wife under 18.
Such marriages are “voidable,” meaning they remain valid until one party (who was a minor at the time) seeks to annul it.
In states like
Karnataka
Haryana
, child marriages are void from the start.
Annulment vs. Divorce
treats the marriage as though it never existed, restoring the individuals to an unmarried status.
acknowledges a valid marriage that existed before dissolution, requiring grounds like cruelty or adultery.
For annulment under PCMA, the petitioner needs only to prove that a child marriage occurred, without needing additional grounds.
Other Civil Remedies under PCMA
The Act also provides support measures like maintenance, residence orders, and the return of wedding gifts to ensure some security for those exiting child marriages.
Challenges of Criminalizing Child Marriage:
While child marriages can be voided, the
, along with other laws like
POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act)
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)
, criminalizes several activities related to child marriage. These include:
Performing or promoting child marriage
Adult men marrying minors
Sexual activity within a child marriage
Impact of Criminalization:
These criminal provisions may inadvertently penalize the families of the married minors, potentially isolating the young girl involved.
It could restrict her access to healthcare and reproductive services due to the fear of legal repercussions for her family.
Studies have shown that criminal laws often disproportionately target self-initiated marriages where young couples elope, as opposed to arranged marriages.
A 2024 study conducted by
Enfold Proactive Health Trust
Civic Data Lab
revealed that nearly half of the 174 PCMA cases examined were self-initiated marriages, pointing towards a nuanced scenario where adolescents exercise agency in patriarchal setups by eloping.
Key Features of the Supreme Court’s Judgement:
Child Betrothals
: The Supreme Court highlighted a loophole in the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), which bans child marriage but is silent on child betrothals.
Betrothals, often used to secure future alliances, can be arranged for children, allowing families to delay marriage until children are of legal age, thereby evading the law.
The Court urged Parliament to criminalize child betrothals, deeming them a violation of children's rights to autonomy, agency, and freedom of choice.
Gendered Impact
: The Court acknowledged for the first time that both boys and girls suffer due to child marriage.
While girls often face physical and emotional abuse, boys are pressured into premature responsibilities, disrupting their personal and professional lives.
Interaction with Personal Laws
: The judgment noted the confusion over how PCMA interacts with various personal laws governing marriage across religious communities.
While the government suggested that PCMA should override personal laws, the Court refrained from making this ruling, awaiting future legislative amendments.
Protecting Childhood
: The Court emphasized that child marriage infringes on the fundamental right to childhood, forcing minors into adult roles and denying them the ability to make informed choices. This perpetuates poverty and social marginalization.
Strengthening Enforcement
: The Court recommended appointing dedicated Child Marriage Prohibition Officers (CMPOs) in every district, ensuring they focus solely on preventing child marriages without other duties that might divert their attention.
Significance of Supreme Court’s Judgement:
Child marriage often results in social and economic hardships for those attempting to leave such unions.
The Supreme Court judgment urges the government to introduce comprehensive support measures, including:
Skill Development & Vocational Training
: To equip women exiting child marriages with economic independence.
Rehabilitation & Follow-Up Support
: Ensuring that those who exit marriages can reintegrate into society.
Compensation
: Consideration of compensation for women under victim support schemes.
Empowering Women within Child Marriages:
Some women might choose to stay in their marriages but need tools to assert their rights regarding reproductive health, employment, and education.
The judgment's focus on
sex education for adolescents
aims to empower young people in such marriages with knowledge to navigate these challenges.
Conclusion:
Recognizing the evolving trends of child marriage, where many young individuals choose to marry on their own, the judgment advocates for a more balanced approach that combines prevention with empowerment rather than solely relying on punitive measures.
This approach aligns with global best practices, which suggest that addressing socio-economic and educational factors can be more effective in eliminating child marriage than punitive action alone.

**********Understanding the U.S. Electoral College System
Why in News?
On November 5, Americans will cast their ballots for their 47th president in the 60th quadrennial elections, primarily between Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump and Vice-President and Democrat Kamala Harris.
Rather than winning the popular vote, the U.S. Constitution stipulates that the winner is the candidate who clinches the most electoral college votes.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the Electoral College?
Structure of the Electoral College
Arguments For and Against the Electoral College
Electoral College for the Election of the President of India
Meaning
The Electoral College is a process
through which the
President and Vice President
of the United States are
indirectly
The system involves three stages:
Selection of electors by the popular vote.
Voting by these electors for President and Vice President.
Counting of electoral votes by Congress to determine the election outcome.
Historical context and rationale for the Electoral College:
The founding fathers debated two options:
Congressional election of the President:
Modelled on parliamentary systems, where the President would be elected by Congress.
Direct popular vote:
Preventing political collusion but potentially leading to dominance by populous states.
The compromise was the Electoral College, intended as a balance to preserve state influence and prevent centralization.
Structure of the Electoral College:
Total electors:
The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.
Elector distribution:
Each state’s number of electors is equal to its congressional delegation (House members + two Senators).
California
, the largest state, has 54 electors, while small states like
Alaska
and Vermont have only three.
Elector selection:
Each political party nominates electors prior to the election, typically party members or affiliates.
Electing the electors:
On Election Day, voters in each state choose electors indirectly by voting for a presidential candidate.
Most states have a "
winner-takes-all
" system, awarding all electoral votes to the candidate with the most popular votes.
However,
Maine and Nebraska use a proportional system,
splitting electoral votes based on congressional district wins.
Duties and voting by electors:
Electors meet in December to formally vote for the President and Vice President.
While electors traditionally vote in line with their party's candidate, there is
no federal law binding them to do so.
many states have laws
enforcing elector loyalty, and faithless electors are rare, as seen in the 2016 election.
Arguments For and Against the Electoral College:
For:
Founders' intent:
The Electoral College would ensure only highly qualified individuals would become President.
National cohesiveness:
Advocates argue it requires distribution of support across the country, preventing large states or cities from dominating.
Criticisms:
Vote disparity:
Large states have disproportionate representation, as individual votes are less influential than in smaller states.
Swing state focus:
Candidates prioritise swing states, neglecting those where one party traditionally dominates.
Faithless electors:
The Electoral College often binds electors to party lines, counteracting its initial purpose of screening candidates.
Conclusion:
The Electoral College remains a contentious aspect of U.S. democracy.
The debate over its relevance continues in the modern era, as advocates for reform push for a shift to direct elections.
Electoral College for the Election of the President of India:
Constitutional basis:
The Electoral College is established under
Article 54
of the Indian Constitution.
It provides a federal balance by
giving states representation proportional to their populations
maintaining parity between the Union and the states
Composition:
The Electoral College for the President’s election includes:
Elected members
of Parliament (MPs) from both the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States).
of the Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) of all states and Union Territories with Legislative Assemblies (such as Delhi, Puducherry and J&K).
Vote value:
Voting method:
The Single Transferable Vote (
STV
) system is used, which enables
Secret ballot
is employed to maintain the confidentiality of the vote.
Each elector casts a vote by
ranking
candidates in
order of preference
Election process:
A candidate must secure more than 50% of the total votes to win, which is referred to as an absolute majority.
If no candidate achieves this majority in the first count, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred based on subsequent preferences.
This process continues until one candidate attains the required majority.
Significance:
This carefully designed system ensures that the President of India is chosen through a representative process that respects both the federal and democratic principles of the Constitution.

**********DANA and deadly floods in Spain
Why in news?
Starting on October 28, intense rains hit southern and eastern Spain, submerging towns, cutting off roads, and impacting millions. Flash floods in Valencia have resulted in at least 64 fatalities.
In some regions, more than a month's worth of rain fell within a day, with Andalusia experiencing four times the usual October rainfall. Between 150 and 200 liters per square meter fell in just two hours, according to Spain’s meteorological agency.
The intense rainfall is attributed to “gota fría” (cold drop) or DANA (isolated high-altitude depression), an annual weather pattern that brings heavy rain.
What’s in today’s article?
Cumulonimbus clouds
Is DANA or cold drop becoming more intense?
About
These are large, towering clouds associated with thunderstorms and severe weather.
They form from warm, moist air rising rapidly in unstable atmospheric conditions and are characterized by their massive, anvil-shaped tops that can reach heights of up to 12,000 meters (39,000 feet) or more.
These clouds are composed of water droplets at lower levels and ice crystals at higher altitudes due to the cold temperatures.
Key Characteristics of Cumulonimbus Clouds
Vertical Growth
: They can extend high into the atmosphere, often reaching the stratosphere.
Thunderstorm Clouds
: They are responsible for intense weather phenomena such as thunderstorms, heavy rain, hail, lightning, and even tornadoes.
Anvil Shape
: Their tops spread out in a flat, anvil-like shape when they hit the upper levels of the atmosphere.
Dense and Dark
: They appear dark on the bottom due to the thickness of water droplets, which block sunlight.
DANA is the acronym for “depresión aislada en niveles altos,” or isolated depression at high altitudes.
(cold drop) phenomenon occurs when
cold air descends
over the
warm Mediterranean waters
, creating atmospheric instability.
This meeting causes a significant temperature difference between the layers of the atmosphere.
As a result, warm, moist air rises quickly, forming dense
cumulonimbus clouds
that release heavy rain.
How DANAs form
Role of the Polar Jet Stream
The polar
jet stream
—a high-altitude, fast-moving wind current separating polar and tropical air—affects the occurrence of DANA, intensifying rainfall patterns in parts of Spain.
A fast-moving wind current in the troposphere separates cold polar air from warm tropical air.
Cold air separation
A pocket of cold air separates from the polar jet stream and descends over the Mediterranean Sea.
Atmospheric instability
The contrast between the cold air and warm air causes the warm air to rise quickly, creating atmospheric instability.
The rising warm air becomes saturated with water vapor and forms dense cumulonimbus clouds.
Occurrence
DANAs are more likely to occur in autumn and spring when temperature variations are more pronounced. They can also cause large hail storms and tornadoes.
Affected regions
The clouds produce heavy rain in parts of
Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, and other areas around the Mediterranean Sea
Increased Frequency and Intensity of Cold Drops
Experts note that cold drops have become more frequent and intense in recent years, with their effects spreading to a wider geographical area.
The Spain’s meteorological agency indicated that heavy rains from cold drops now also impact inland cities like Madrid, where such abundant rainfall was previously uncommon.
Impact of Climate Change
This change is partly attributed to soaring global temperatures, which allow warmer air to hold more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall.
The rise in sea surface temperatures of the Mediterranean Sea has further exacerbated the situation, with record high temperatures recorded in August.
Experts emphasized that cold drops are formed by the interaction of cold air with increasingly hotter surfaces, contributing to this phenomenon.

**********Census: A Crucial Element for Delimitation and Women's Reservation Quota
Context:
The delayed Census, which may begin next year and conclude by 2026, is crucial for two major political processes: the delimitation of constituencies and the implementation of women’s reservation in elected bodies.
What’s in today’s article?
Delimitation Commission
About
In the Indian context, the exercise of redrawing the boundaries of Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly Constituencies in a region is known as delimitation.
In this process, the number of seats allocated to a particular state/UT in Lok Sabha or in the Legislative Assembly may vary.
For example – Delhi, a union territory with legislative assembly, has 7 Lok Sabha constituencies while in the Legislative Assembly it has 70 constituencies.
Need
Delimitation helps in redrawing the boundaries (based on the data of the last Census) in such a
way that the population of all the constituencies, as far as practicable, remain equal throughout the State/UT
It ensures a fair division of geographical areas so that all political parties or candidates contesting elections have a level playing field in terms of a number of voters.
Constitutional provisions
Article 82 and Article 170
of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to readjust the allocation of seats in the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies of States respectively,
after every census
Accordingly, Parliament establishes a
through specific Acts to oversee this process.
The Parliament has enacted the Delimitation Commission Acts in 1952, 1962, 1972 and 2002 for this purpose.
There was no Delimitation Commission Act after the 1981 and 1991 census.
Last delimitation was done in 2002
The present delimitation of constituencies has been done on the
basis of 2001 census data
under the provisions of Delimitation Commission Act, 2002
The next Delimitation Commission will be set up after 2026.
adjusted constituency boundaries based on population but did not increase the number of seats
, which have remained fixed since
1976
Constitutional amendments in
froze seat allocations until after the
first Census following 2026
Currently, there are
543 Lok Sabha seats
4,123 seats in state Assemblies.
These figures are based on the
1971 Census for Lok Sabha
2001 Census for state Assemblies
, reflecting a population of
81 crore
102.87 crore
, respectively.
With an estimated population of
5 billion
for the next Census, a substantial increase in the number of seats is anticipated.
Challenge for the next delimitation commission
Questions on the Use of 2021 Census Data
Debate exists on whether the 2021 Census (likely conducted in 2025 and published in 2026) can be used for readjustment per Article 82.
Need for Constitutional Amendments
To enable delimitation before the next Lok Sabha elections, amendments will be needed in Article 82, along with Articles 81, 170, and 55, which govern Lok Sabha composition, state Assemblies, and the President’s election, respectively.
Regional Disparities in Population Control
The issues that delayed delimitation in 1976 and 2001 persist.
Southern states, which have effectively controlled their populations, could lose representation if seat increases are based solely on population growth, which is higher in the North.
Delimitation Commission:
The Delimitation Commission is a high-powered committee entrusted with the task of drawing and redrawing of boundaries of different constituencies for state assembly and Lok Sabha election.
It is
appointed by the President
and works in collaboration with the Election Commission.
The Commission consists of –
A retired or working Supreme Court Judge (chairperson)
Election Commissioner
Concerned State Election Commissioners
The Commission’s orders have the force of law and
cannot be called in question before any court
The Commission’s orders are laid before the Lok Sabha and the legislative assemblies concerned,
but they cannot effect any modifications in the orders
Women’s reservation
Constitutional Amendment for Women’s Reservation
In September 2023, the
128th Constitutional Amendment
established a 33% reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and state Assemblies.
The implementation depends on the next delimitation exercise, which will occur after the 2021 Census results are published, likely in 2026.
The reservation is set to last 15 years.
Challenges of Seat Reservation for Men and Women
For over 35 years, concerns over losing seats hindered the passage of women’s reservation.
A 33% reservation would allocate 182 seats to women in a 545-member Lok Sabha, reducing available seats for men to 363 (from the current 467).
With delimitation potentially raising Lok Sabha seats to 770, around 257 seats could be reserved for women, while 513 seats would remain open for men, easing concerns for political parties and reducing disruptions for male politicians.
