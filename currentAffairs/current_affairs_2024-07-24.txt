Issue of Railway Safety in India
Why in News?
According to Union Budget 2024-25, the Ministry of Railways has received a record allocation of over ₹2.55 lakh crore in financial year 2024-25, which is a jump of 5.85% from the previous year’s ₹2.41 lakh crore.

Highlights of the Union Budget 2024-25
Highlights of the Economic Survey 2023-24
Issue of Railway Safety in India:
Total number of train accidents in India:
The six-year period between 2015-16 to 2021-22 saw 449 train accidents (excluding train accidents from Konkan Railways).
Most prominent categories of train accidents in India:
Incidents of derailments
have been the most common cause of train accidents in India.
According to the CAG’s Performance Audit of Indian Railways,
nearly three fourth of 217 train accidents
across the country between 2017-18 and 2020-21 were caused by derailments.
The 2nd most common cause of train accidents is
level crossing accidents
, followed by
fire and collisions
Major factors responsible for derailments:
Maintenance of tracks, deviation of track parameters beyond permissible limits, and bad driving/over speeding.
Recommendations of the CAG:
Development of a strong monitoring mechanism:
To ensure timely implementation of maintenance activities by adopting fully mechanised methods of track maintenance and improved technologies.
Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK):
Railway administration must follow the guiding principles for deployment of RRSK funds.
Detailed Outcome Framework:
Indian Railway may prepare the framework for each item of safety work.
Conducting and finalising accident inquiries:
Ensuring strict adherence to the scheduled timelines for conducting and finalising accident inquiries.
Highlights of the Union Budget 2024-25:
The total outlay provided for capital expenditure:
It comes to ₹2.65 lakh crore
after accounting for ₹2.52 lakh crore from general revenue, ₹200 crore from the Nirbhaya Fund, ₹3,000 crore from internal resources, and ₹10,000 crore from extra budgetary resources.
The majority of this fund will be spent on
ensuring safety works,
along with the creation of assets, acquisitions, construction and replacement.
In 2014, only ₹35,000 crore was spent towards capital expenditure on railways.
The actual operating ratio of the railways
Operating ratio is the number of rupees spent to earn every hundred rupees.
In Budget Estimates of FY 2024-25, this has gone up a bit to
98.22%
(from 98.10% for FY 2022-23). This means for every 100 rupees spent, railways earn 98.22 rupees.
The operating ratio shows how efficient the management is at keeping costs low while generating revenue.
Kavach installation:
Kavach (Automatic Train Protection System) consists of multiple components like hardware, software, optical fibre.
As India has a diverse network of railway systems, the challenge is to combine all networks for deployment of Kavach.
However, as approvals on Kavach 4.0 have been received, the pace of installation of the system will be rapid.
Highlights of the Economic Survey 2023-24:
Slow pace of Kavach installation:
Kavach has been deployed on 1,465 route km in the South-Central Railway. This is just 2.14% of the total railway network of 68,426 route km and 7,349 railway stations.
Switch from mechanical signaling:
Out of 17 operational railway zones in India, eight zones have become free from mechanical signaling.
However, only 46% of India’s 7,325 railway stations had made the switch from mechanical signaling to electronic interlocking system (introduced in India 12 years ago) till FY24.
Capex deployment:
The capex deployment in railways has increased by 77% over the past five years, ranging to ₹2.62 lakh crore in FY24 with significant investments in construction of new lines, gauge conversion and doubling.
Installation of signaling intervention - Automatic Block Signaling (ABS):
This system uses automatic signals to regulate train passage between blocks, preventing rear-end collisions and assisting trains travelling in the same direction.
While the ABS is a proven low-cost signaling solution, it has been commissioned on only
6.47%
of total length of Indian Railways.

**********Supreme Court’s Split Verdict on Permission for GM Mustard
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court on July 23 pronounced a split verdict on the validity of the Centre’s 2022 decision granting conditional approval for environmental release of genetically modified (GM) mustard crops.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About GM Crops (Meaning, Benefits, Concerns, etc.)
Regulations in India (Laws/Bodies Related to GM Crops)
News Summary
About Genetically Modified (GM) Crops:
Genetically Modified (GM) crops are plants whose DNA has been altered through genetic engineering techniques to introduce desirable traits.
These traits may include resistance to pests, diseases, or environmental conditions, improved nutritional content, or increased yield.
Unlike traditional crossbreeding methods, genetic modification allows for the direct manipulation of a plant’s genetic material, often incorporating genes from different species to achieve specific results.
Benefits of GM Crops:
Increased Yield:
GM crops can produce higher yields, contributing to food security.
Pest and Disease Resistance:
Crops can be engineered to be resistant to specific pests and diseases, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.
Herbicide Tolerance:
Some GM crops are designed to withstand certain herbicides, making weed control more effective.
Enhanced Nutritional Content:
Crops can be modified to contain higher levels of essential nutrients, addressing malnutrition in developing countries.
Environmental Benefits:
Reduced need for chemical inputs can lower the environmental impact of agriculture.
Concerns / Controversies w.r.t. GM Crops:
Environmental Impact:
There is ongoing debate about the potential for GM crops to affect non-target species and lead to a reduction in biodiversity.
Health Concerns:
While extensive research indicates that GM foods are safe to eat, public concern about potential long-term health effects persists.
Economic Issues:
GM seeds are often patented, leading to concerns about corporate control over the food supply and the economic impact on small-scale farmers.
Ethical and Labeling Issues:
There are ethical debates surrounding the manipulation of genetic material, and many advocate for clear labeling of GM products to inform consumer choice.
Regulations w.r.t. GM Crops in India:
In India, the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change oversees all activities, operations, and products associated with genetically modified organisms.
These are regulated under the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee
(GEAC), part of MoEFCC, has the authority to review, monitor, and approve all GMO-related activities, including import, export, transportation, manufacture, use, and sale.
GEAC is a statutory body established under the Environment Act.
Additionally, GM foods must comply with the regulations set by the
Food Safety and Standards Authority of India
(FSSAI).
Currently,
cotton is the only GM crop approved for commercial cultivation in India
About GM Mustard:
In 2023, the GEAC had recently given the green light for the commercial cultivation of genetically modified mustard.
Dhara Mustard Hybrid
(DMH-11), created by scientists at Delhi University, employs genes from soil bacteria to make mustard, typically a self-pollinating plant, more suitable for hybridization than traditional methods.
The GEAC approved "the environmental release of mustard hybrid DMH-11 for seed production and testing in accordance with existing ICAR guidelines and other applicable regulations prior to its commercial release."
Supreme Court’s Split Verdict on Permission for GM Mustard:
The SC delivered a split verdict on the Centre's 2022 decisions regarding the environmental release of the genetically modified mustard hybrid DMH-11 for seed production and testing.
Petitions:
The court was responding to pleas by activist Aruna Rodrigues and the NGO 'Gene Campaign.
The petition called for a moratorium on the release of any GMOs into the environment until a comprehensive, transparent, and rigorous biosafety protocol is publicly available and conducted by independent experts.
Divergent Opinions:
Justice Nagarathna:
She deemed the October 2022 decisions of the GEAC invalid due to the absence of a health department member and the absence of eight members from the meeting.
Justice Karol:
He found no manifest arbitrariness in the GEAC decisions and stated that field trials should proceed with strict safeguards.
Next Steps:
The bench referred the matter to Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud for further adjudication by the appropriate bench.
National Policy on GM Crops:
Both justices agreed on the
need for a national policy on Genetically Modified (GM) crops
They directed the Centre to consult all stakeholders and experts within four months to formulate this policy.

**********For the social sector, it is old wine in an old bottle 
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Schemes related to the social sector;
Mains level:
Employment challenges;
Why in the News?
Budget 2024 maintains the same approach as previous years regarding social sector allocations.
Decreasing allocations in the Budget for social sector schemes
Education Sector:
The allocations for school education increased by ₹5,000 crore and for higher education by ₹3,000 crore. The increased recoveries from fees and self-financing schemes suggest a shift towards cost recovery in educational institutions.
Health Sector:
The allocation for the Department of Health and Family Welfare rose by only ₹1,500 crore.
Food Subsidy:
There is a limited increase in food subsidies despite rising economic costs and the need to update coverage based on the latest population figures.
Shift in Approach:
The government giving greater emphasis on cost-effectiveness and privatization in education and health, shifting focus towards contributory schemes like the Atal Pension Yojana.
Social Sector Schemes in Budget 2024-25
Social Protection Schemes:
POSHAN Scheme:
There is a slight increase from ₹11,600 crore to ₹12,467 crore, but still less than the actual expenditure in 2022-23.
Saksham Anganwadi Scheme:
The allocation increased to ₹21,200 crore from ₹20,554 crore, but no increase in salaries for Anganwadi workers or honorarium for mid-day meal cooks.
Maternity and Social Assistance:
Samarthya Scheme:
The budget reduced to ₹2,517 crore from ₹2,582 crore. The PMMVY scheme’s maternity benefits have remained unchanged since 2017.
NSAP:
Allocation for social security pensions remains unchanged at ₹9,652 crore, reducing real coverage and value.
Schemes for the Unemployed
The ‘Prime Minister’s Package for Employment and Skilling’ includes government-sponsored internships, formalization of jobs through incentives for EPFO enrolments, and skill-development programmes
An allocation of ₹2 lakh crore over five years for the employment package, linked to industry response
Schemes for Street Vendors
The PM SVANidhi Scheme (PM Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi) aims to benefit over 50 Lakh street vendors across India
All lending institutions, including NBFCs, are participating in the scheme to provide affordable loans to street vendors
Employment Challenges
Stagnant Wages and Dampened Demand:
The Indian economy faces significant challenges with stagnant wages, which affect consumer demand. This stagnation can hinder overall economic growth and employment generation.
Reliance on the Private Sector for Job Creation:
The government is increasingly looking to the private sector to address employment challenges.
Initiatives like the
aim to incentivize private sector job creation through government-sponsored internships and skill development programs.
Limited Budgetary Allocations:
The budgetary allocations for employment-related schemes are limited, with the entire employment package amounting to ₹2 lakh crore over five years.
Focus on Supply-Side Solutions:
The current approach emphasizes supply-side measures to incentivize the private sector rather than addressing the underlying demand-side issues, such as low consumer spending and economic uncertainty.
Way forward:
Enhance Social Sector Investments
: The government should significantly increase budget allocations for critical social sector schemes, particularly in education, health, and social protection.
Comprehensive Employment Strategy
: Need to develop a holistic approach to employment that addresses both supply and demand-side issues.
**********Key takeaways from the 2023-24 Economic Survey   
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Data trends in economic survey;
Mains level:
Major five issues with the Indian Economy;
Why in the News?
The 2023-24 Economic Survey highlights realistic challenges for India’s growth, projecting GDP growth at 6.5%-7% for FY 2024-25 despite 8% growth in FY 2023-24.
What are the major five issues with the Indian Economy?
Weak Demand:
In India, an unfavourable environment for FDI growth is due to high interest rates in developed countries, which increases the cost and opportunity cost of investment in India.
Dependence on China:
Due to over-reliance on China for imports, particularly in key sectors like renewable energy, limits India’s manufacturing capabilities and increases vulnerability to geopolitical tensions.
Tepid Private Investment:
Despite tax cuts aimed at stimulating capital formation, the corporate sector has not significantly increased investment, leading to a lack of job creation and economic dynamism.
Employment Challenges:
The need to generate approximately 78.5 lakh jobs annually in the non-farm sector until 2030 to accommodate the growing workforce, coupled with insufficient data on job creation, complicates labour market analysis.
Infrastructure Deficiencies:
Inadequate infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and sanitation, continues to hinder economic development and efficiency, requiring substantial investment and reform to improve productivity.
What are the suggestions given in the Economic Survey?
Private Sector’s Role in Job Creation:
The corporate sector should take responsibility for creating jobs, as it is in their enlightened self-interest.
Embracing Healthy Lifestyle:
Indian businesses should learn from India’s traditional lifestyle, food, and recipes to live healthily and in harmony with nature.
Focusing on Agriculture:
The farm sector can generate higher value addition, boost farmers’ income, create opportunities for food processing and exports, and make the sector attractive to urban youth.
Removing Regulatory Bottlenecks:
Licensing, inspection, and compliance requirements imposed by various levels of government are an onerous burden on businesses, especially MSMEs.
Improving Data Quality:
The lack of availability of timely data on the absolute number of jobs created in various sectors precludes an objective analysis of the labour market situation.
Way forward:
Enhance Infrastructure Development
: Need to prioritize investments in essential infrastructure such as roads, railways, and sanitation to boost economic efficiency and productivity.
Strengthen Data Collection and Analysis
: The government should develop robust mechanisms for timely and accurate data collection on employment and other key economic indicators.
Mains PYQ:
Do you agree with the view that steady GDP growth and low inflation have left the Indian economy in good shape? Give reasons in support of your arguments.

International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Bordering countries of India;
Mains level:
Neighbourhood First Policy;
Why in the News?
The Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman prioritized India-funded projects in neighbouring countries, receiving the majority of the Ministry of External Affairs’ allocation.
What are the India-funded projects in the neighbourhood?
India has provided significant aid to
including funding for
hydroelectric power
plants like
Pardi, Trishuli and Devighat.
Afghanistan,
India has provided over $3 billion in assistance and was involved in over 400 projects across 34 provinces, including major infrastructure projects like the
Salma Dam
he Zaranj-Dalaram Highway.
Myanmar, Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Projects
is $484 million project aims to connect the northeastern Indian state of Mizoram to the Sittwe port in Myanmar’s Rakhine state.
In the 2024-25 budget, India allocated ₹700 crore to Nepal (up from ₹550 crore), ₹245 crore to Sri Lanka (up from ₹150 crore), and ₹30 crore to Seychelles (up from ₹10 crore).
Reasons for reduced focus on Bhutan
Bhutan, the largest recipient of MEA’s annual allocation, saw a dip in funding by ₹332.02 crore to ₹2,068.56 crore.
However, this slight reduction does not indicate a decrease in funding for projects in Bhutan, as India and Bhutan recently cleared 61 projects amounting to ₹4,958 crore.
Importance of Bhutan for India:
Strategic Importance:
Bhutan shares borders with India and China, acting as a buffer state between the two. Its strategic location is crucial for India’s security interests.
India has provided assistance to Bhutan in areas like defence, infrastructure, and communication to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
During the 2017 Doklam standoff between India and China, Bhutan allowed Indian troops to enter its territory to resist Chinese incursions.
Economic Importance:
India is Bhutan’s largest trading partner, accounting for 98% of its exports and 90% of its imports.
Bhutan’s hydropower potential is a significant source of revenue, and India has been instrumental in assisting Bhutan in developing these projects.
India provides substantial economic support to Bhutan. In 2015-16, India’s budgetary support to Bhutan stood at ₹61.60 billion, making it the largest recipient of India’s foreign aid.
Cultural Ties:
Bhutan and India share strong cultural ties, as both countries are predominantly Buddhist
Future scope for India’s Neighbourhood Policy (Way forward)
Strengthening Bilateral Ties:
Need to negotiate free trade agreements, promote investments, and collaborate on infrastructure projects to boost economic ties.
For example,
India and Bangladesh have made significant progress in recent years, with the inauguration of the Maitri Setu bridge connecting Tripura to Bangladesh. The two countries are also working on the Akhaura-Agartala rail link to enhance connectivity.
Promoting Regional Cooperation
Need to collaborate on regional initiatives such as the BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal) Motor Vehicles Agreement for seamless movement of goods and people.
For instance,
India has been actively involved in the BIMSTEC Coastal Shipping Agreement and the BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection project to enhance regional connectivity and energy cooperation.
Mains PYQ:
Evaluate the economic and strategic dimensions of India’s Look East Policy in the context of the post-Cold War international scenario.

**********Defence funds decline, BRO gets backing 
Security Issues
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Trend in Defence budgeting;
Mains level:
Significance of indigenisation in defence sector ;
Why in the News?
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has allocated ₹6.22 lakh crore for the Defence Ministry for 2024-25, matching the amount presented in the interim Budget in February.
Budgetary allocation for different sectors
Border Roads Organisation (BRO):
The BRO received a significant increase in funding, with an allocation of ₹6,500 crore, aimed at improving border infrastructure and promoting socio-economic development in border areas.
Indian Coast Guard:
The allocation for the Indian Coast Guard is ₹7,651.8 crore, which is 6% lower than the revised estimates for FY24. Of this, ₹3,500 crore is designated for capital expenditure to enhance maritime capabilities.
Innovation in Defence:
An additional ₹400 crore has been allocated for innovation in defence through the Acing Development of Innovative Technologies with iDEX (ADITI) scheme, aimed at engaging startups and MSMEs in developing indigenous defence technologies.
Overall Allocation Breakdown:
The allocation for the Defence Ministry includes 27.66% for capital expenditure, 14.82% for revenue expenditure, 30.66% for pay and allowances, 22.7% for defence pensions, and 4.17% for civil organizations under the Defence Ministry.
Marginal Capex Push
Slight increase in capital expenditure:
The budget reflects a marginal increase in capital expenditure, focusing on strengthening the capabilities of the armed forces and enhancing domestic procurement.
Strategic infrastructure development:
The increased allocation to the BRO and the Coast Guard indicates a strategic push towards improving infrastructure in border areas and maritime security, though the overall capital push remains modest.
Focus on Indigenous solutions:
The emphasis on domestic capital procurement and innovation through the iDEX scheme aims to bolster self-reliance in defence technology, fostering a more robust Indigenous defence industry.
Long-term strategic goals:
The allocations are aligned with long-term strategic goals, including enhancing operational preparedness and infrastructure development in sensitive regions, although the overall growth in capital expenditure may be viewed as conservative.
Balancing defence needs with budget constraints:
While the budget seeks to address critical defence needs, the slight reduction in the overall percentage of the budget allocated to defence suggests a balancing act between defence priorities and other pressing social and economic needs.
Way forward:
Enhance Focus on Indigenous Production:
The government should further promote indigenous production capabilities by increasing investments in research and development, and by providing incentives for domestic manufacturers to produce advanced defence technologies.
Strengthen Infrastructure Development:
The need for continued emphasis on infrastructure projects, particularly in border areas, should be prioritized to enhance national security and socio-economic development, ensuring that allocations are effectively utilized for maximum impact.

**********What is a Climate Finance Taxonomy, announced by FM Sitharaman?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
The 2024 Union Budget, presented by Finance Minister, includes developing a
taxonomy for climate finance.
The aim is to enhance the availability of capital for climate adaptation and mitigation.
What is a Climate Finance Taxonomy?
A climate finance taxonomy is a classification system that identifies which
economic activities
can be marketed as
sustainable investments.
It serves as a
guide for investors
financial institutions
to direct capital towards projects that contribute to climate adaptation and mitigation, aligning with broader environmental goals.
Significance of a Climate Finance Taxonomy
Net-Zero Economy:
With global temperatures rising and the adverse effects of climate change worsening, countries need to transition to a net-zero economy.
Alignment with Transition Pathways
: Taxonomies help ascertain if economic activities are aligned with credible, science-based transition pathways.
Deployment of Climate Capital
: They provide an impetus for the deployment of climate capital by directing investments towards sustainable projects.
Reduction of Greenwashing Risks
: Taxonomies help reduce the risks of greenwashing by providing clear criteria for what constitutes a sustainable investment.
Why does India need a Green Taxonomy?
According to the IFC,
India needs an estimated
$10.1 trillion
to achieve net-zero by 2070
Public investments alone can’t match this goal
, calling for standardization in investments.
Benefits for India
For India, a taxonomy could
attract more climate funds
from international sources.
Currently,
green finance flows in India are falling short
of the country’s needs, accounting for
only around 3% of total FDI inflows
, according to the Landscape of Green Finance in India 2022 report by the Climate Policy Initiative.
lack of clarity on what constitutes sustainable activity
is a significant reason for the low green finance flows. A taxonomy would address this issue.
India’s Climate Commitments:
India aims to achieve a
The country has pledged
to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030
, compared to the 2005 level.
India has also committed to
achieving about 50% of its cumulative electric power
installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.
Steps taken by India:
In January 2021, India established a
task force on sustainable finance
under the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.
The task force’s objectives include creating a framework for sustainable finance, establishing pillars for a sustainable finance roadmap, suggesting a draft taxonomy of sustainable activities, and creating a framework of risk assessment by the financial sector.
In April 2021, the RBI joined the Central Banks and Supervisors
Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)
as a member.
RBI is also a member of a task force on
climate-related financial risks
set up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Platform on Sustainable Finance.
Potential for Green Investments in India
According to a report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), India has a
climate-smart investment potential of $3.1 trillion
from 2018 to 2030.
The largest investment opportunity
lies in the electric vehicle segment
, with a potential of $667 billion as India aims to electrify all new vehicles by 2030.
renewable energy sector
also presents a substantial investment opportunity,
estimated at $403.7 billion.
International Adoption of Taxonomies
Many countries have either started developing or have finalized their taxonomies.
Countries with developed taxonomies include South Africa, Colombia, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Canada, and Mexico.
The European Union has also developed its own taxonomy.

tax on capital receipts

in the global context.
This clause was
inserted by the Finance Act
in 2012
to prevent laundering of black money, round-tripping via investments with a large premium into unlisted companies.
The tax covers investment in any private business entity, but
only in 2016
was it applied to startups.

money laundering
or round-tripping under guise.

net worth of ₹2 crores
or an income of
more than ₹25 Lakh
in the past 3 fiscal years.
Key Issues with Angel Tax

The tax impacted the valuation of shares, causing complications for startups in raising funds.
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method:
Issues arose with the treatment of estimated figures in the DCF method, leading to disputes.
Scrutiny of Funding Sources:
