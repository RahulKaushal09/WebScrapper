HINDU KUSH HIMALAYA FACES RISKS AMID RECORD GLACIER MELTING
Mains – ENVIRONMENT
The State of the Cryosphere 2024 report, presented at the UN Climate Change Conference in Baku, warns that rising carbon emissions could increase global temperatures by over 3°C by century’s end, causing unprecedented glacier melting, including in the Indian Himalayan Region.
The glaciers of the HKH region, also known as the “Third Pole” or the “Water Tower of the Earth”, are the source of some of the world’s major river systems like the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra.
Key takeaways
Cryosphere refers to the frozen water part of the Earth’s surface. Its components include snow, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, sea ice and permafrost. These elements are primarily found in polar regions, high latitudes and high-altitude areas of the Earth’s surface.
Rising temperatures are affecting every part of the Cryosphere. This year’s summer is the third in a row when sea ice in Antarctica was reduced to less than 2 million square kilometers.
If the current warming trend continues to grow, there is a possibility of complete sea ice loss around Antarctica during the summer months. This would cause the warming of water and further melting of Antarctica’s ice sheet.
Also, it is estimated that exceeding the 1.5°C limit could cause a rise above 10 meters in sea level in the coming centuries.
Venezuela lost its last glacier, ‘Humboldt,’ this year, while Indonesia’s ‘Eternity Glacier’ will likely melt completely within the next two years.
As the temperature increases, there will be less solid precipitation (snow) and more liquid precipitation, even at higher altitudes, resulting in less seasonal snow occurrence overall.
Additionally, thawing permafrost will lead to increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Hindu Kush Himalayan region
The HKH region witnessed record-low snowfall during the winter of 2023-2024. This decline in seasonal snow availability will also have an impact on food, energy and water security for both the country and the region.
The Indian Himalayan Region, which spans 13 states and Union Territories, will be directly affected by these changes. It is projected that even a 2°C rise in global temperatures could result in a 50 per cent loss of ice from High Mountain Asian glaciers.
This will intensify catastrophic hazards, such as the Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), already occurring in High Mountain Asia, particularly in India. Recent GLOF at South Lhonak Lake in Sikkim (October 2023), led to the loss of human lives and extensive damage to infrastructure.

ARCTIC TUNDRA IS EMITTING MORE CARBON THAN IT IS ABSORBING
Prelims & Mains – GEOGRAPHY
Arctic tundra, which has stored carbon for thousands of years, has now become a source of greenhouse gases (GHGs), according to a new analysis report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA).
The analysis, ‘Arctic Report Card’, is a yearly report on the polar region and was published last week.
How does the Arctic tundra store carbon?
In a typical ecosystem, plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. These plants grow, die, or are eaten by animals which also grow and die. When they die, the carbon in their corpse feeds microorganisms such as bacteria or fungi which break down larger molecules and return CO2 to the atmosphere, thereby completing the carbon cycle.
However, in the case of Arctic tundra, the decomposition of organic matter is dramatically slowed down due to the cold climate. Plant and animal remains can stay trapped for thousands of years in permafrost thwarting CO2 from getting released back into the atmosphere.
Scientists estimate that Arctic soils store more than 1.6 trillion metric tonnes of carbon across the region. That is about double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
Why is the Arctic tundra emitting more carbon than absorbing it?
In recent years, however, the Arctic tundra’s ability to emit less and absorb more carbon has taken a hit. The new analysis confirmed that the ecosystem has now become a source of CO2 and methane (CH4) emissions.
That has happened for two main reasons. One is rising temperatures. The report said the Arctic is warming four times the global rate.
As a result, the Arctic’s permafrost is thawing, meaning microbes in the soil are becoming active and breaking the organic matter down, releasing CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere.
Another reason is that, in recent years, the Arctic has witnessed an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires. Last year was the worst wildfire season in the Arctic on record. Wildfire smoke adds GHG emissions to the atmosphere while also speeding up the thawing of permafrost.
Wildfires and rising temperatures together, between 2001 and 2020, caused the Arctic tundra to release more carbon than its plants removed from the air, probably for the first time in many millennia, the report said.

MIRROR BACTERIA
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
A group of 38 scientists working in nine countries has sounded an alarm about the potential creation of mirror bacteria.
While the science and technology necessary to create mirror bacteria in a laboratory is a decade or more away, the scientists argued that the possibly lethal risks posed by this new field of research are “unprecedented” and “overlooked.”
Mirror bacteria are a hypothetical form of synthetic life that scientists are exploring. These organisms are constructed from molecules that are mirror images of those found in natural life forms.
What are Mirror Bacteria?
Chirality: Natural life forms use molecules with specific orientations, known as chirality. For example, DNA and RNA are composed of right-handed molecules, while proteins are made from left-handed amino acids. Mirror bacteria would have reversed chirality, with left-handed DNA and right-handed proteins.
Synthetic Creation: Scientists are working on creating bacteria with these mirror-image molecules, which could have unique properties and behaviors.
Potential Risks:
Immune Evasion: Mirror bacteria could potentially evade natural immune defenses, as these defenses rely on recognizing specific molecular shapes. This could make infections caused by mirror bacteria difficult to control.
Environmental Impact: These bacteria might also evade natural predators like viruses and protists, potentially leading to uncontrolled spread in the environment.
Health Threats: There is concern that mirror bacteria could cause lethal infections in humans, animals, and plants, posing a significant health risk.

**********Tuberculosis
The Government of India recently launched a 100-day tuberculosis (TB) campaign, focusing on active screening in 347 high-risk districts. In its first week, the campaign detected 6,267 new TB cases.
Understanding Tuberculosis (TB):
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
, which primarily affects the lungs.
TB is a
curable and preventable disease
if detected early and treated appropriately.
There are two types of TB infections:
Latent TB
: In this state, the bacteria remain inactive in the body and cause no symptoms. It is not contagious but can become active.
Active TB
: In this condition, the bacteria cause symptoms and can be transmitted to others.
Globally,
one-quarter of the population
is estimated to have latent TB.
Individuals infected with TB bacteria have a
5-15% lifetime risk
of developing the disease.
People with
compromised immune systems
—such as those with
HIV
malnutrition
diabetes
, or those who use
tobacco
—have a significantly higher risk of falling ill with TB.
Transmission of Tuberculosis:
TB spreads from person to person through the air.
When a person with lung TB
coughs, sneezes, or spits
, TB bacteria are released into the air.
Even inhaling a few droplets of contaminated air can cause an infection.
Key Facts and Objectives of the Campaign:
Over
5 lakh individuals
have been actively screened through
health and wellness centres
850 mobile testing vans
Target population
: The campaign targets
25 crore vulnerable individuals
, including:

**********Milkweed fiber
The Union Ministry of Textiles is encouraging by extending its research and development efforts into new natural fibers, including milkweed fiber.
About Milkweed fiber:
It is the
seed fiber
obtained from
milkweed plant.
Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) plant belongs to the genus Asclepias of the family Asclepiadaceae and is also known as
stubborn weed.
In India, it is found as a wild plant in the
Rajasthan, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
Milkweed contains an abundance of milk sap in its leaves, stems and pods.
Properties of Milkweed fiber:
It contains
oily material and lignin,
a woody plant substance, which makes them too brittle for spinning. It has a
hydrophobic–oleophobic surface
due to the natural waxes found on the surface of the fiber.
Applications:
It is used in
paper industries.
In addition, it is also used as an
insulative filling material.
It is used in such water-safety equipment as life jackets and belts.

**********Strengthening the Roots of an Agri-Carbon Market
Context
The concept of carbon markets holds immense promise for transforming Indian agriculture
by incentivising sustainable farming practices while addressing the pressing challenge of climate change.
These markets,
rooted in the principles of carbon pricing, function through compliance and voluntary mechanisms.
By developing a system where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are offset through regulated frameworks
or voluntary efforts,
carbon markets present a dual opportunity:
creating economic benefits for farmers and contributing to global climate goals.
Understanding the Concept of Carbon Markets and their Objective
Compliance Carbon Markets
Compliance markets, also known as mandatory markets, are
regulated by international agreements, national governments, or regional authorities.
Their
primary objective is to enforce emission reduction targets by establishing caps
on the amount of GHG emissions a company or industry can produce.
Entities that exceed these caps are required to purchase carbon credits
or face financial penalties, such as carbon taxes.
Carbon credits in compliance markets are often derived from projects that actively mitigate emissions,
such as reforestation, renewable energy generation, or sustainable agriculture.
For example,
agroforestry projects can absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide,
while renewable energy projects replace fossil fuel usage with cleaner alternatives.
Voluntary Carbon Markets
Unlike compliance markets,
voluntary carbon markets operate outside government mandates.
These markets enable organisations, individuals, and businesses to offset their
carbon footprint on a discretionary basis.
Participants purchase carbon credits to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability,
often as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives or to meet consumer expectations for environmentally conscious practices.
Credits in voluntary markets are issued through mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism
, Verra, and Gold Standard.
These frameworks certify projects that reduce or remove GHG emissions
, ensuring the integrity and credibility of the credits.
Objective of the Carbon Market: Complementary Roles in Climate Mitigation
While compliance and voluntary markets operate under distinct paradigms,
they share a common goal: reducing GHG emissions to combat climate change.
Compliance markets drive systemic change by enforcing stringent regulations,
while voluntary markets foster grassroots innovation and participation.
Together, they create a comprehensive approach to emissions reduction
, balancing mandatory obligations with voluntary contributions.
In the Indian context
, these markets hold immense potential for transforming agriculture
Challenges in India's Agricultural Carbon Market
Lack of Farmer Awareness and Participation
One of the most pressing issues is the l
imited awareness among farmers about the concept of carbon markets,
their benefits, and how they function.
Surveys indicate that 45% of farmers involved in carbon credit projects reported no communication
regarding the initiative.
Without a clear understanding of the goals
, processes, and rewards,
farmers are unlikely to actively engage in sustainable practices or trust the system.
Additionally,
cultural, and educational barriers often make it difficult for farmers
, especially those in rural and marginalised communities,
to comprehend complex carbon trading mechanisms.
Inadequate Training in Sustainable Practices
For farmers to meet the additionality condition,
a key criterion for earning carbon credits, they must adopt new and innovative sustainable practices.
However,
over 60% of farmers reported receiving no training or guidance in implementing techniques such as zero tillage
, intercropping, micro-irrigation, or alternate wetting and drying.
Without proper training, farmers struggle to implement these methods effectively,
leading to suboptimal outcomes and frustration.
The lack of technical support also increases the risk of project failure
Farmers unable to maintain sustainable practices
often revert to conventional methods, which
compromises the permanence of the environmental benefits achieved.
Delayed and Insufficient Financial Incentives
A significant incentive for farmer participation in carbon markets is the
potential for additional income through the sale of carbon credits.
the reality often falls short of expectations
alarmingly, 99% of farmers involved in these projects have not received carbon credit payments.
This
delay undermines trust in the system
and discourages continued participation.
Moreover,
the financial returns promised by carbon markets are often insufficient to offset the costs or risks
associated with transitioning to sustainable farming.
Yield Penalties and Food Security Concerns
Farmers transitioning to sustainable practices
often experience yield reductions during the initial years of implementation.
This is especially concerning for smallholder farmers
, who rely heavily on their harvest for both income and subsistence.
Yield penalties not only threaten their livelihoods but also raise broader concerns about food security,
particularly in a country like India where agriculture plays a critical role in feeding a large population.
Quality and Credibility of Carbon Credits
The credibility of carbon markets
depends on the quality of the credits generated.
Projects that fail to deliver promised environmental benefits produce unreliable credits
, eroding buyer confidence.
If buyers perceive Indian agricultural carbon credits as low-quality or unverifiable, they may stop purchasing them altogether.
This would deprive farmers of a vital income source
and discourage the adoption of sustainable practices.
The Path Forward to Address the Challenges in India’s Agriculture Carbon Market
Improving the Agricultural Carbon Market
Projects should prioritise smallholders and marginalised communities
, with higher prices for credits generated by these groups.
Effective communication, regular training, and guaranteed payments are essential
to sustaining farmer participation.
Partnerships with research institutions can help identify regions and interventions
that balance yield improvements with carbon farming.
Advancing the Science of Carbon Monitoring
measurement and monitoring of soil carbon and GHG emissions have seen significant advancements
, with tools like remote sensing, satellite imagery, drones, and sensors becoming more accessible.
These technologies can improve the accuracy and reliability
of carbon markets.
the key lies in overcoming traditional implementation challenges
, such as ensuring transparency, inclusivity, and timely rewards for farmers.
Conclusion
potential of carbon markets to revolutionise Indian agriculture cannot be overstated
and with concerted effort,
India can establish a robust agricultural carbon market that supports both its farmers and its environmental goals.
By aligning sustainable practices with economic incentives, these markets can serve as a powerful tool
for climate mitigation and rural development.
Success, however, depends on addressing the current challenges, creating collaboration among stakeholders, and ensuring that the benefits of carbon markets are accessible to all,
particularly smallholders and marginalised farmers.

**********Himalayan Birch Tree
According to new research, climate change is altering Himalayan tree landscape where drought-resistant fir trees are replacing the Himalayan birch Trees.
About Himalayan Birch Tree:
It is a
deciduous broadleaved species
that dominates the Himalayan region.
Distribution:
It is widely distributed in the altitudinal range from
3100 - 3800m
in North-western Himalaya.
It is native to the
Western Himalayas
and grows at elevations of up to 4,500 metres
Features:
It has a high
freezing tolerance potential,
allowing it to form a treeline in the Himalayan region.
It is a long-lived species which can
survive up to 400 years
and the only angiosperm in the Himalaya which dominates an extensive area at sub - alpine altitudes.
Ecological significance:
It contributes to the preservation of the Himalayan ecosystem by
reducing soil erosion and creating a bio-shield
for the remaining forests and sub-alpine meadows below the treeline.
Highlights of the research:
Birch trees are
struggling to grow
due to stress
from increased temperatures
and lack of moisture.
Birch tree which
need more moisture
, are growing less due to heat-related dryness.
Fir and birch compete for space, sunlight, water and nutrients, making it even harder for birch to grow.
Climate change-driven disturbances such as early snowmelt, snow fungi, avalanches, landslides, insect outbreaks, hotter droughts and fires will further hinder the recruitment of less resilient species like birch.
Impact on environment:
The shift of dominant plant functional types from deciduous to evergreen may also
alter ecological functions
such as the rate of litter decomposition, carbon and nitrogen cycling, water-use efficiency, interactions with animals and fungi and energy fluxes, with further impacts on the composition of alpine plant communities

**********Potential Reasons for Discontinuation of the Sovereign Gold Scheme
Why in news?
The government is considering ending the sovereign gold bond scheme due to its high financing costs. Initially launched to boost gold investment, this objective has been addressed by the recent reduction in gold import duty announced in the 2024-25 Budget, which has increased gold demand.
Earlier reports indicated concerns over using sovereign gold bonds to finance the fiscal deficit, prompting a review of the scheme's continuation.
What’s in today’s article?
Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme
Concerns regarding sovereign gold bonds
Conclusion
Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme (SGB)
About
Introduce in 2015 under the Gold Monetization Scheme, SGBs are government securities issued by RBI on behalf of the Government of India.
These are
debt securities linked to the value of gold
SGBs are denominated in grams of gold. They are substitutes for holding physical gold.
Investors have to pay the issue price in cash and the bonds will be redeemed in cash on maturity.
Features
Each unit represents one gram of gold and offers a fixed interest rate of 2.5% per annum, credited semi-annually.
These bonds can be traded in the secondary market and are redeemable in Indian rupees based on the average closing price of 999 purity gold from the last three business days before maturity.
Benefits
Key benefits include protection against market price fluctuations, redemption flexibility after five years (with an eight-year tenor), and lower risks and costs compared to holding physical gold.
High Cost of Financing Fiscal Deficit
The government views financing the fiscal deficit through SGBs as costly, with limited benefits in terms of physical gold collection.
The number of SGB tranches has been consciously reduced over time—from 10 per year to just two.
Impact of Reduced Customs Duty on Gold
In July 2024, the government lowered the customs duty on gold from 15% to 6%, leading to a drop in gold prices and a surge in demand.
This aligns with the government's objective to boost gold demand but diminishes the need for SGBs as an investment option.
Decline in SGB Issuances and Borrowing Targets
Gross SGB issuances for FY 2024-25 were reduced to Rs 18,500 crore from Rs 29,638 crore in the interim budget.
Net borrowing through SGBs was also cut to Rs 15,000 crore from the earlier Rs 26,138 crore.
No new issuances of SGBs have been made so far in FY 2024-25.
SGB Redemption Performance
SGB Series I (2016-17) matured in August 2024, providing a return of over 120% on the initial investment, with redemption prices rising from Rs 3,119 to Rs 6,938.
SGB Series II bonds redeemed in March 2024 yielded a 126.4% return over the investment value, excluding interest.
Premature redemption for bonds issued between May 2017 and March 2020 has been scheduled from October 2024 to March 2025.
Given the limited benefits of SGBs as an investment option and their high financing costs, the government is reevaluating the scheme's continuation.

**********Imaging of underwater hot spring active with microbial life
Why in news?
Indian oceanographers have achieved a historic feat by capturing an image of an active
hydrothermal vent
located 4,500 meters below the Indian Ocean.
This discovery, made under the Ministry of Earth Sciences' Rs 4,000-crore Deep Ocean Mission, holds immense potential for mineral exploration.
What’s in today’s article?
Deep Ocean Mission (DOM)
What Are Hydrothermal Vents?
About
DOM is a program to explore the deep ocean and develop technologies to use its resource.
The mission, estimated at Rs. 4,077 crore over five years, will be implemented in phases.
The first phase (2021-2024) has an allocation of Rs. 2,823.4 crore.
This mission-mode project supports India's Blue Economy initiatives, with MoES serving as the nodal ministry to coordinate this multi-institutional effort.
Goal
To develop technologies to use the ocean's living and non-living resources, and to improve understanding of the ocean's role in climate change
Components
The mission has six main components, including:
Manned submersible
: A submersible to carry three people to depths of 6,000 meters, equipped with scientific tools and sensors
Ocean climate change advisory services
: To develop models and observations to understand and predict climate variables
Deep-sea biodiversity
: To study the flora and fauna of the deep sea, including microbes, and to develop ways to use the ocean's bio-resources sustainably
Deep ocean survey and exploration
: To identify potential sites for multi-metal hydrothermal sulfide mineralization in the Indian Ocean
Energy and freshwater
: To develop ways to use the ocean for energy and freshwater
Advanced marine station
: To establish a station for ocean biology
Lead agencies
The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), the Department of Space (DoS/ISRO), the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), and other organizations.
Hydrothermal vents are underwater springs found near tectonic plate boundaries.
They occur when
cold water at the seabed (around 2°C) interacts with magma in tectonically active regions, heating up to 370°C
This superhot water emerges as plumes, rich in minerals and gases, through vent chimneys and fissures.
The Discovery Process
Survey History
The National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) in Goa has been conducting geophysical surveys in the Central and Southern Indian Ocean Ridges since 2012 to locate hydrothermal vents.
Recent Campaign
In April 2024, NCPOR and the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) conducted high-resolution imaging along the Central Indian Ridge, narrowing their search using an automatic underwater vehicle (AUV).
Historic Image captured
The Indian AUV launched from the research vessel Sagar Nidhi captured a high-resolution image of the vent during a 12-15 hour observation campaign.
Significance
Mineral-Rich Deposits
Hydrothermal vents are significant due to their deposits of valuable minerals and metals.
These are: Copper, Zinc, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Iron, Cobalt, Nickel etc.
These deposits can remain active for hundreds to thousands of years, making them economically and scientifically vital.
Biological Insights
Hydrothermal vents support unique ecosystems.
Chemosynthetic organisms thrive by utilizing chemicals enriched with minerals and metals, similar to how plants use sunlight for photosynthesis.
Chemosynthetic organisms are organisms that use chemical reactions to create food, rather than sunlight, and include bacteria and archaea.
Significance for India's Deep Ocean Mission
This discovery boosts India's Deep Ocean Mission, especially the Samudrayaan initiative, focusing on mineral exploration.
The findings confirm earlier surveys and open new opportunities for understanding deep-sea ecosystems and resource potential.
India as a leading player in deep-sea exploration
This milestone positions India as a leading player in deep-sea exploration, with promising implications for scientific and economic advancements.
Future Exploration Plans
NCPOR plans to intensify exploration through TV-guided grab sampling to study the economic and biological potential of these vents further.

**********Making affordable generics more reliable
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to health care sector;
Why in the News?
India’s decentralised drug regulation system dominated by State Drug Regulatory Authorities causes inconsistent quality standards. Strengthening oversight is essential to ensure generics are as affordable and effective as branded drugs.
How Reliable Are Generic Medicines?
Bioequivalence to Innovators
: Generic medicines are bioequivalent to brand-name drugs, meaning they have the same active ingredient and are intended to work the same way.
Affordability and Accessibility
: Generics significantly lower healthcare costs, making treatment more accessible, especially for low-income populations.
Challenges in Quality
: Despite their potential, the reliability of generics has been questioned due to variability in therapeutic outcomes, often caused by differences in excipients, manufacturing processes, and bioequivalence thresholds.
What are the main quality concerns associated with it?
Efficacy and Bioavailability:
Studies have shown that while generics are bioequivalent to branded drugs, they may not always achieve the same therapeutic levels.
For example, a study on itraconazole showed that only 29% of patients using generic versions achieved the right drug levels in their body within two weeks, compared to 73% of patients using the original branded drug.
Manufacturing Variability:
The manufacturing processes for generics can differ significantly from those of branded drugs. Variations in excipients (binders, fillers) and production methods can lead to differences in
tablet hardness, dissolution rates,
overall drug stability.
This variability can result in inconsistent therapeutic outcomes.
Regulatory Oversight:
India’s decentralized drug regulation system contributes to inconsistent quality standards across states.
Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)
has limited authority over
State Drug Regulatory Authorities (SDRAs),
leading to regulatory arbitrage where manufacturers exploit weaker oversight. Moreover, the lack of stringent enforcement of stability testing further jeopardizes the quality of generics available in the market.
What regulatory reforms are needed?
Centralisation of Drug Regulation:
A comprehensive overhaul of India’s drug regulation system is necessary. Centralising oversight under the CDSCO would help enforce consistent quality standards across all states and reduce the risk of substandard drugs entering the market.
Enhanced Stability Testing Protocols:
Uniform stability testing protocols should be established to ensure that all generics maintain their quality under various climatic conditions. This would involve periodic reassessment of approved generics to uphold their efficacy over time.
Stricter Impurity Standards:
Aligning India’s Pharmacopoeia with international standards regarding permissible impurity levels would improve the overall quality of generic medicines available in the market.
How can patient and healthcare provider perceptions of generics be improved? (Way forward)
To enhance patient and healthcare provider confidence in generic medicines, several strategies can be employed:
Public Awareness Campaigns:
Educating patients about the efficacy and safety of generics compared to branded drugs can help dispel misconceptions that higher-priced medications are superior.
Incentives for Healthcare Providers:
Offering incentives for prescribing generics can encourage healthcare professionals to recommend these cost-effective alternatives more frequently.
Strengthening Quality Assurance:
Implementing stronger regulatory frameworks and ensuring compliance with quality standards can build trust among both patients and providers regarding the reliability of generics.
Mains PYQ:
Why is there so much activity in the field of biotechnology in our country? How has this activity benefitted the field of biopharma?

**********Strengthening the roots of an agri-carbon market
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Carbon Market;
Why in the News?
In India, current carbon credit projects by private organisations should be reviewed to ensure they are fair and work effectively.
What are the current carbon credit projects?
Collaborative Initiatives
: NABARD, ICAR, and State Universities have listed five agricultural carbon credit projects in the Verra registry to promote sustainable agriculture.
Carbon Farming Projects
: Over 50 projects targeting 1.6 million hectares aim to generate 4.7 million carbon credits annually, but none are registered, leaving farmers without financial benefits.
Note:
Verra is a carbon credit registry that manages the
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)
, ensuring high-quality carbon credit projects and facilitating transparent trading of carbon credits.
What are the key challenges facing agricultural carbon markets?
Lack of Communication and Training:
A significant portion of farmers (45%) reported inadequate communication regarding carbon farming practices, and over 60% lacked training in new techniques. This gap in knowledge can hinder the effective implementation of sustainable practices necessary for generating carbon credits.
Exclusion of Marginalized Communities:
Many existing carbon farming projects have not adequately included smallholders and marginalized communities, with women representing only 4% of participants. This lack of inclusivity limits the socioeconomic benefits that carbon markets could provide to a broader segment of the farming population.
Financial Incentives:
A notable 28% of farmers discontinued sustainable practices by the second year due to insufficient financial incentives. The absence of timely payments for carbon credits further discourages participation and undermines project sustainability.
Unregistered Projects:
Despite over 50 agricultural carbon farming projects being listed in the Verra registry, none have been officially registered, meaning no carbon credits have been issued and farmers have not received any financial compensation.
Quality Assurance:
Ensuring that projects deliver reliable environmental benefits is crucial. If projects fail to produce credible carbon credits, it may lead to a loss of confidence among buyers, which would ultimately deprive farmers of income and discourage sustainable practices.
How can farmers be incentivized to participate in carbon markets?
Higher Prices for Inclusive Projects:
Offering premium prices for carbon credits from projects that actively include smallholders and marginalized communities can encourage broader participation and ensure equitable benefits.
Effective Communication and Training Programs:
Establishing robust communication channels and providing regular training on sustainable agricultural practices will empower farmers to adopt new techniques confidently.
Guaranteed Timely Payments
: Implementing a system that ensures farmers receive prompt payments for their carbon credits will enhance trust in the market and encourage ongoing participation in sustainable practices.
Collaboration with Research Institutions:
Partnering with national and international research organizations can help identify suitable regions for carbon farming, ensuring that interventions are effective and do not compromise food security.
Bundling Small Farmers into Cooperatives:
Creating Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can help reduce transaction costs, improve bargaining power, and facilitate easier access to carbon markets for smallholder farmers.
What role do technological advancements play in enhancing agri-carbon markets?
Improved Measurement Techniques:
Advances in digital technologies such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, drones, and sensors will enhance the monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) processes essential for assessing soil carbon levels and GHG emissions accurately.
Data Accessibility:
The increasing availability of technology will allow farmers to access real-time data on their farming practices, enabling them to make informed decisions that align with sustainable methods required for carbon credit generation.
Enhanced Project Implementation:
Technology can streamline project management by facilitating better communication between stakeholders, tracking progress, and ensuring compliance with additionality and permanence criteria necessary for successful carbon credit projects.
Scalability of Projects:
Digital tools can help scale successful carbon farming initiatives by providing frameworks that can be replicated across different regions, thus expanding the reach of agricultural carbon markets in India.
Way forward:
Strengthen Inclusivity and Farmer Incentives
: Promote inclusive projects that actively engage smallholders and marginalized communities by offering premium prices for carbon credits, ensuring timely payments, and bundling farmers into cooperatives for better market access.
Leverage Technology for Efficiency
: Utilize advanced digital tools like remote sensing and real-time data systems to improve monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) processes, enhance project scalability, and ensure effective implementation of carbon credit initiatives.
Mains PYQ:
Should the pursuit of carbon credits and clean development mechanisms set up under UNFCCC be maintained even though there has been a massive slide in the value of a carbon credit? Discuss with respect to India’s energy needs for economic growth..
