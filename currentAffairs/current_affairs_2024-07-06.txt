HOUSE RULES GOVERNING THE EXPUNCTION POWERS OF RAJYA SABHA CHAIRMAN, LOK SABHA SPEAKER
Syllabus
Prelims & Mains – Polity
Context:
The first special session of the 18th Lok Sabha witnessed heated discussions, with the Opposition clashing with the government. Rajya Sabha Chairman removed significant portions of Mallikarjun Kharge’s speech, Meanwhile, in the Lower House, parts of Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on the PM and the BJP were expunged from the records on the orders of Speaker.
Background:-
The practice of expunging remarks is a standard parliamentary procedure, but the ‘selective expunction’ by the presiding officers has become a flashpoint between the Opposition and the Centre.
When are remarks expunged from parliamentary records?
Parliament maintains a verbatim record of everything that is spoken and takes place during proceedings.
While Article 105 of the Constitution confers certain privileges and freedom of speech in Parliament on MPs, it is subject to other provisions of the Constitution and the rules of the House.
On the orders of the presiding officer, that is, the Chairman in the Upper House and the Speaker in the Lower House, words, phrases and expressions which are deemed “defamatory, indecent, unparliamentary or undignified” are deleted or expunged from records.
There have been recorded instances where the scope of expunction has been broadened. The Speaker, at their discretion, has ordered the expunction of words deemed prejudicial to national interest or detrimental to maintaining friendly relations with a foreign State, derogatory to dignitaries, likely to offend national sentiments or affect the religious susceptibilities of a section of the community, likely to discredit the Army, and not in good taste or otherwise objectionable or likely to bring the House into ridicule or lower the dignity of the Chair, the House or the members.
Members must withdraw objectionable remarks deemed irrelevant to the debate upon the Chair’s request and failure to comply may lead to expunction.
Similarly, quoting from an unreferenced document or speaking after being asked to desist can result in an expunction.
Continuous interruptions during speeches may also be expunged at the Speaker’s discretion.
How do presiding officers expunge remarks? What do the rules say?
The Chairman and Speaker are vested with the power to order the expunction of remarks under Rule 261, and Rule 380 and 381 of the Rules of Procedure of the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha, respectively.
Rule 261 states, “If the Chairman is of opinion that a word or words have or have been used in debate which is or are defamatory or indecent or unparliamentary or undignified, he may in his discretion, order that such word or words be expunged from the proceedings of the Council.
The Lower House has a similar provision. Rule 380 says, “If the Speaker is of the opinion that words have been used in debate which are defamatory or indecent or unparliamentary or undignified, the Speaker may, while exercising discretion, order that such words be expunged from the proceedings of the House.”
The expunged portions are marked by asterisks with an explanatory footnote stating ‘expunged as ordered by the Chair.’ If the Chair directs that nothing will go on record during a member’s speech or interruption, footnote ‘not recorded’ is inserted.
A comprehensive list of words and phrases is circulated to media outlets at the end of the day’s proceedings. Once expunged, these words or phrases cease to exist on the official record. Anyone who publishes them thereafter is liable to face charges for breach of privilege of the House.
However, the relevance of the practice of expunging remarks has lately come into question, in a digital age where expunged content remains accessible due to the live telecast of proceedings and wider circulation of screenshots and videos on social media.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND : A CRITICAL VIEW
Mains – GS 2
Mass protests in Kenya, in which at least 30 people were shot and killed by police, against an IMF-backed finance Bill that sought to raise taxes on essentials bring into focus, once again, the conditions the multinational lender imposes on poor countries in return for loan assistance.
The IMF describes itself as being governed by and accountable to its member countries. But its history and management structure tell a different story — of an organisation that has served as a tool of western elitist policy.
About the Kenyan crisis
In 2021, Kenya signed a four-year loan agreement with the IMF for $2.34 billion, and with another deal signed in May 2023, its loan volume rose to $3.6 billion. But IMF money for developing countries comes in tranches, and with conditions.
IMF periodically reviews the country’s progress in implementing its conditions, and only if it is convinced the country is on track, does it release the next tranche of funds.
As part of the 2021 loan deal, the IMF forced a COVID-battered Kenya to agree to austerity measures that would raise its revenue collection to 25% of GDP.
The lender’s demands included a combination of tax hikes and budget cuts, including elimination of subsidies on fuel and electricity and cuts in spending on education and health.
Government cut subsidies on maize and fuel, with the latter sparking a surge in inflation. Massive protests ensued. Nonetheless, government stayed the course on other fiscal consolidation measures, and earlier this month, government reached a staff level agreement with the IMF. It was expected to open the tap on another $976 million, provided the finance Bill — projected to raise revenues of $2.68 billion — went through. But protest has forced Kenyan president to abandon it, and now the future flow of IMF funds is in doubt.
None of this, however, is new. Kenya has been through this before, as have much of Africa, whose governments often find themselves caught between the interests of their people and that of private investors and Western commercial banks, fronted by the IMF.
In 1944, when the IMF was created at a conference of 44 nations in Bretton Woods, U.S., the global supremacy of American economic might was already a reality, with the rest of the world either devastated by the World War II or by colonial plunder, or both. This power dynamic got encoded into both the Bretton Woods twins — the IMF and the World Bank. For instance, the World Bank president is always an American citizen, while the IMF head is always from a European ally of the U.S.
Unwritten mandate
In theory, their function is to aid economic development and promote monetary cooperation and stability. But in practice, they have followed an unwritten mandate to foster the integration of former colonies into a global economic order on terms designed to serve American capital.
Voting rights at the IMF don’t follow the democratic logic of one-member country-one vote but are quota-driven, based on dollar contributions. The U.S. alone has a voting share of 16.5%, while the wealthy G-7 countries together command more than 40% of the voting power.
The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres flagged bias in the IMF framework when he said that the Bretton Woods system reflected the power relations of 1945. He also underscored how the IMF favoured the rich in the context of its distribution of Special Drawing Rights (a reserve asset), observing, “The IMF allocated $650 billion in SDRs during the pandemic. The G7 countries, with a population of 772 million people, received $280 billion. The African continent, with $1.3 billion people, received only $34 billion.”
This unfairness, and the unequal relationship with the IMF, is partly why so many developing countries, from Kenya to Ghana, Zambia and Pakistan, have witnessed protests against the IMF and IMF-imposed economic policies — the infamous ‘Structural Adjustment Programs’ (SAPs).
SAPs, adopted by the IMF from 1986 onwards, typically require governments to cut public spending (including on food subsidies, health and education), privatise state enterprises, reduce import duties and tariffs, and implement other measures so that the country pursues export-led growth.
Impact of SAPs
A 2002 World Bank-funded study by the Structural Adjustment Participatory Review International Network (SAPRIN) tracked the impact of the IMF’s SAPs.
Its report highlighted four ways in which they furthered “impoverishment and marginalisation of local populations”:
one, by causing the demise of domestic manufacturing sectors and loss of employment for small producers;
two, agricultural, trade and mining reforms decimated small farms and poor rural communities;
three, they triggered job losses, lower wages and degraded terms of employment due to privatisation, budget cuts and labour market flexibilisation measures;
four, the reduced role of state in providing guaranteed access to essential services led to increase in poverty.
Yet, the IMF, as the international lender of last resort, continues to impose SAP-like requirements.The erstwhile ‘SAP’ conditionalities have now morphed into generic austerity measures.
Faced with a backlash , the IMF did introduce ‘social spending floors’ to protect public spending on education, health and social protection from being cut as part of its loan conditionalities. But an Oxfam analysis of 27 loan programmes negotiated with low- and middle-income countries found that “for every $1 the IMF encouraged governments to spend on public services, it has told them to cut six times more than that through austerity measures.”

**********Spiritual Orientation, Religious Practices and Courts
Context
The
constant debate over the intersection of religion and law
often brings to the forefront the
complexity and sensitivity involved in adjudicating religious practices.
In the Indian context,
religion has been a cornerstone of societal existence
, with a pronounced religiosity among its population.
Therefore,
it is important to examine the judicial order in
Navin Kumar (2024)
by Justice G.R. Swaminathan of the Madras High Court
, which permitted the religious practice of angapradakshinam, and the broader implications of judicial intervention in religious practices.
Angapradakshinam and the Court's Ruling
Angapradakshinam is a ritual that involves devotees rolling over banana leaves on which others have partaken food,
specifically in the context of the Sri Sadasiva Brahmendral temple in Tamil Nadu.
This practice,
previously restricted by a 2015 order from Justice S. Manikumar due to concerns of caste discrimination.
Recently it was allowed by Justice Swaminathan, who argued that the ritual did not exclusively involve Dalits
but included participants from various castes.
Justice Swaminathan's decision relied heavily on constitutional provisions
, asserting that the petitioner’s right to practice his religion (
Article 25
) and his right to privacy and human dignity (
Article 21
) were upheld by this practice.
Implication of the Order: Revival of the Debate on Essential Religious Practices
The order has
reignited debates on several fronts
: the definition of religion, the criteria for determining essential religious practices, and the judiciary’s consistency in such determinations.
Justice Swaminathan, in his detailed judgment, cited several Supreme Court rulings
to assert that angapradakshinam was an established religious practice.
However, unlike similar cases, the court did not rigorously scrutinise whether the practice was essential
and integral to Hinduism or merely a superstitious act.
lack of scrutiny raises questions about the judiciary's approach
to defining essential religious practices.
An Analysis of Judicial Consistency and the Essential Practices Doctrine
Origin and Early Application
The doctrine was first articulated in the landmark case of The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt
(1954).
Supreme Court of India held that Article 25 protects not only religious beliefs but also the outward expressions
of those beliefs through rituals and ceremonies.
Court stated that what constitutes an essential part of religion should be determined with reference
to the doctrines of that religion itself.
case set a precedent for future determinations
of essential religious practices.
Despite the clear principles laid out in the
case, subsequent judgments have often deviated
from this standard, leading to inconsistent applications of the Essential Practices Doctrine.
The Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali
(1961)
In this case,
the Supreme Court took a more restrictive approach
and the Court ruled that only those practices which are essential and integral to the religion are protected under Article 25, and not every practice that claims religious significance.
The Court differentiated between practices that are superstitious and those that are essential,
marking a shift from a broad to a narrower interpretation of protected religious practices.
Gramsabha of Village BattisShirala
(2014)
In Gramsabha of Village BattisShirala,
a sect claimed that capturing and worshipping a live cobra during the festival of Nag Panchami was an essential religious practice.
The Court, however, relied on more general texts of the Dharmashastra, which did not mention such a practice, and ruled that it was not an essential practice.
decision demonstrated the Court's willingness to interpret religious texts broadly
rather than deferring to specific sectarian claims.
Mohammed Fasi v. State of Kerala
(1985)
Kerala High Court in
faced the question of whether a Muslim policeman could grow a beard as part of his religious practice.
Court dismissed the claim, noting that some Muslim dignitaries do not sport beards
, and the petitioner himself had not always worn a beard.
Court did not examine Islamic texts in depth to determine the essentiality of the practice,
relying instead on empirical observations.
case highlighted the Court's reliance on practical considerations
over religious doctrines.
Acharya Jagdishwarananda Avadhuta v. Commissioner of Police, Calcutta
(2004)
In this case, the
Calcutta High Court initially ruled that the tandava dance was an essential practice of the Ananda Margi faith.
Supreme Court, however, overruled this decision
, noting that the dance was adopted into the faith only in 1966, despite the faith itself being established in 1955.
Court's reasoning suggested that a practice could not be considered essential if it was not part of the religion from its inception
, thus freezing religious practices in time and ignoring their evolutionary nature.
Ismail Faruqui v. Union of India
(1995)
The Faruqui
case dealt with the acquisition of land where the Babri Masjid once stood.
Supreme Court held that while offering prayers is an essential Islamic practice, doing so in a mosque is not,
unless the mosque holds specific religious significance.
This judgment overlooked the central role of congregational prayers in Islam and the significance of mosques in facilitating these prayers
, showcasing the Court's inconsistent application of the essential practices test.
Way Forward: The Need for a Coherent Approach
Avoid Theological Judgments:
The court
should focus on legal and constitutional principles
rather than delving into theological interpretations, thus maintaining judicial impartiality and respect for religious autonomy.
Consider Evolution of Practices:
Judges
should recognise that religious practices can evolve over time and that contemporary practices may hold significance
even if they were not present at the religion's inception.
Uphold Constitutional Values:
court should ensure that all religious practices, even those deemed essential, conform to constitutional values
such as public order, health, and morality, balancing religious freedom with other fundamental rights.
Conclusion
The Essential Practices Doctrine remains a crucial yet contentious aspect of judicial adjudication in India
and a balance is essential for maintaining the secular and pluralistic fabric of Indian society.
While it aims to protect genuine religious practices, its inconsistent application has led to confusion
and controversy.
A more coherent and principled approach is needed to ensure that religious freedoms are protected
without compromising constitutional values.

Editorial Analysis
**********Tariff hikes on Chinese goods and Red Sea crisis are fuelling container shortages, impacting exporters
Why in news?
India and global traders are grappling with severe container shortages as the European Union’s 37.6% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports begin, preceding upcoming US tariffs.
At a recent Commerce Ministry review,
Indian exporters highlighted that container shortages, a persistent issue since the COVID-19 pandemic, are exacerbated by structural weaknesses
The Red Sea crisis and renewed US-China trade tensions have further increased ship voyage times, intensifying the shortages.
What’s in today’s article?
Reasons behind the container crunch
Container production in India
Steep US and EU tariffs on Chinese products
Indian exporters face severe container shortages due to heightened demand from Chinese exporters aiming to beat steep US and EU tariffs on products like electric vehicles (EVs) and semiconductors.
The US tariffs, which can reach up to 100% on EVs and 50% on semiconductors, along with the EU’s 37.6% tariffs, will become effective from August 1.
These have prompted a rush to ship goods, leaving fewer containers for Indian exporters.
Due to the scale of trade between the US and China, container demand has gone up leaving Indian exporters with fewer containers for exports.
Contribution of the Red Sea crisis
The Red Sea crisis further exacerbates the shortage, with near-daily attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels reducing traffic by 90% and forcing ships to take longer routes via the Cape of Good Hope.
This has increased port congestion, with global congestion hitting an 18-month high and 60% of ships waiting in Asia.
Continued and expanded tariffs
Unlike past tariff hikes, the current situation is worsened by the continued and expanded tariffs under the Biden administration, targeting high-demand items like EVs.
Additionally, other countries like Canada and Indonesia are also imposing higher tariffs on Chinese goods, increasing global demand for containers.
Indonesia has also announced an import tariff of up to 200 percent on a range of Chinese goods.
Dependence on China for containers
India's dependency on China for containers, which produces 95% of the global supply, is a significant issue.
China is the largest exporter of containers.
Much of the container manufacturing in China is done by a handful of highly subsidized state owned enterprises that has
sparked security concerns in the US, EU as well as in India
Efforts to mitigate this dependence began post-COVID-19, with India and the US initiating domestic container production to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing.
In 2021 that state-owned wagon manufacturer Braithwaite, and engineering major Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited had received an order from Container Corporation of India (CONCOR) to develop and produce 1000 containers each.
However, the production did not go as expected.
In 2023, Railway Minister told Parliament that CONCOR was facing problems in supply and procurement of domestic containers.
He told the Parliament that CONCOR had placed orders for 19,000 containers on seven indigenous container manufacturers located in Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Maharashtra, and Gujarat.
However, till 31 March 2023, about 500 containers had been delivered to CONCOR.

**********India’s Balance of Payments
Why in News?
After a gap of 10 quarters, India’s current account balance posted a surplus of $ 5.7 billion or 0.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) during the fourth quarter (Jan-Mar) 2024 (Q4FY24) mainly due to a surge in services exports.
The country’s current account cannot be understood in isolation and the larger picture is provided by the so-called ‘
’.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is Balance of Payments (BoP)?
How to Read the RBI’s Q4FY24 BoP Figures?
Understanding the meaning of BoP:
BoP summarises all transactions
that a country's individuals, companies, and government bodies complete (over a defined period) with individuals, companies, and government bodies outside the country.
For example,
it shows how much money (in US Dollar or Indian Rupee terms) went out of the country and how much money came into the country.
These transactions could be -
Trade (export or import) of goods or services.
Investments (an Indian buying land in the US or an American firm investing in the Indian stock exchanges).
Exchange of loans between Indian and other countries of the world, etc.
Constituents of the BoP:
All possible transactions are divided into two main accounts - the Current Account and the Capital Account.
Current Account:
It refers to all transactions that are related to current consumption and it is further divided into -
Trade Balance
(the export and import of physical goods) and
Invisibles Trade
(trade in services, e.g. banking, IT, tourism, etc).
As can be seen from the table, India had a trade deficit (import>export) but a surplus in the Invisibles trade.
However, since the trade deficit was bigger than the surplus on the Invisibles trade, the overall current account of India is also in negative or deficit. This is called the
Current Account Deficit
(CAD).
Capital Account:
The capital account refers to those transactions which are not for current consumption, but for
investment
It includes
net foreign investments
(either foreign direct investment or foreign portfolio investments) and
or money that countries
borrow
from each other.
As can be seen from the table, India had a capital account surplus of $90 billion from April-December 2021 as against a current account deficit of $26.6 billion.
BOP:
Individually, either of these accounts can be in surplus or deficit.
A surplus implies that more money is coming into the country than going out of it. Whereas a deficit (shown with a (-) mark) implies more money is going out of the country than coming in.
By definition, the
BoP always balances,
which implies that the deficit on one account must be balanced by a surplus on the other account.
How does the BoP balance?
The net result of a current account deficit ($ 26.6 billion) and a capital account surplus ($ 90.1 billion) is that a total of
63.5 billion US dollars have entered the Indian economy.
To balance the BoP
, RBI takes out these dollars and keeps it with itself (shown with a (-) sign before it) and adds (as assets) to its
foreign currency reserves.
The increased forex also leads to an
increased money supply in the Indian economy
(which can also lead to higher inflation),as RBI increases its liabilities by the same amount ($63.5 billion) by printing the domestic currency
This elucidates RBI’s role in maintaining the BoP, which in turn
determines India's exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves.
Why does the RBI intervene?
Take a case when more and more dollars have started coming into the Indian economy because of a growing capital account surplus.
If the RBI does not intervene
, the increased demand for rupees vis-a-vis the dollar would have meant that the rupee would have
appreciated
in value.
As a result,
India’s exports would have become costlier
for the US or the rest of the world, thus bringing down their demand.
At the same time, Indians would have found foreign goods cheaper, thus India’s
imports would have gone up
This would have led to a widening of the
trade deficit or the current account deficit
to such an extent that the BoP would have balanced on its own.
When the RBI intervenes
, India's exchange rate remains constant while its forex reserves increase.
Apart from a current account surplus of $ 5.7 billion, the Q4FY24 shows a net surplus of $25 billion on the capital account.
There was a current account deficit of $1.3 billion (0.2% of GDP) during the fourth quarter, which was $8.7 billion (1% of GDP) during the quarter ended December 2023 (Q3FY24).
Contrary to the images they evoke,
the words ‘deficit’ and ‘surplus’ do not always correlate to ‘bad’ and ‘good’ respectively
, a surplus on the current account in FY 2020-21 does not lead to much economic activities as a result of Covid-induced lockdowns.
Typically, for a country like India, a current account deficit happens because
a developing economy
needs to import lots of capital goods (say, machineries) to build up its capacity to produce more exports.
A trade deficit also suggests
that India’s underlying economy has a strong demand impulse.
For a country like India, a current account deficit of 1.5%-2% of GDP is consistent with a GDP growth rate of 7%-8%.

**********Amidst politicians’ new reverence for the Constitution, one thing to remember 
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Constitutional Provisions
Mains level:
Basic Structure and foundational principles should never be allowed to be eclipsed
Why in the news?
Voters have cleverly embraced the idea of constitutional principles to protect their freedoms. It’s now everyone’s responsibility, including elected officials, citizens, and the judiciary, to ensure that there’s no overreach.
Constitutional Provisions:
Article 99:
Mandates that every member of Parliament must take an oath or affirmation to uphold the Constitution.
Third Schedule:
Specifies the form of oath or affirmation that members of Parliament, judges of the Supreme Court, and High Courts must take.
Part III (Fundamental Rights):
Guarantees civil liberties, such as the rights to equality, freedom of speech, and right to life.
Part IV (Directive Principles of State Policy):
Provides guidelines for governance, directing the state in certain policy matters for the welfare of citizens.
Basic Structure and Foundational Principles:
Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973):
Established the doctrine that certain features of the Constitution are beyond the amending power of Parliament if they violate its “Basic Structure”, ensuring that fundamental principles like democracy, secularism, judicial review, and federalism cannot be altered.
Include the rule of law, separation of powers, judicial independence, and protection of fundamental rights.
Protection of Fundamental Rights:
The Basic Structure doctrine safeguards fundamental rights and core constitutional principles such as democracy, secularism, judicial independence, and federalism. These principles form the bedrock of India’s democratic framework and ensure that the rights of citizens are protected against any arbitrary or unconstitutional actions by the state.
Preservation of Constitutional Balance:
Eclipsing the Basic Structure and foundational principles could upset the delicate balance of powers among the legislature, executive, and judiciary. These principles ensure that no single branch of government becomes disproportionately powerful, thereby maintaining the checks and balances essential for democratic governance.
Upholding the Rule of Law:
The Basic Structure doctrine reinforces the supremacy of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. By preventing its core principles from being undermined or diluted through constitutional amendments or legislative actions, it ensures that all state actions, including laws passed by Parliament, are consistent with constitutional norms and the rule of law.
Significance of “Judicial Overreach”:
Protection of Rights:
Judicial overreach often arises when courts intervene to protect fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, especially when legislative or executive actions are perceived to violate these rights.
Checks and Balances:
It serves as a crucial check on the powers of the legislature and executive, ensuring that their actions conform to constitutional principles and do not exceed their authority.
Defending the Constitution:
Courts may intervene to uphold the supremacy of the Constitution, ensuring that laws and actions comply with its provisions, including the Basic Structure doctrine established in the Kesavananda Bharati case.
Criticisms of judicial overreach:
Interference with the Separation of Powers:
Critics argue that judicial overreach interferes with the constitutional principle of separation of powers, which is meant to ensure that each branch of government operates within its own sphere of influence.
Lack of Accountability:
Another criticism of judicial overreach is that the judiciary is not accountable to the people in the same way that elected representatives are. Judges are appointed, not elected, and their decisions are often made in an opaque, highly technical fashion that can be difficult for lay people to understand.
Dilution of Democracy:
Some critics argue that judicial overreach can undermine the democratic process by taking important decisions out of the hands of elected officials and placing them in the hands of judges.
Mains PYQ:
What was held in the Coelho case? In this context, can you say that judicial review is of key importance amongst the basic features of the Constitution?

**********The spectre of neo-fascism that is haunting Europe 
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
What is Neofascism?
Mains level:
Impact of Neofascism on Europe
Why in the news?
Before France’s UEFA Euro 2024 opener, Kylian Mbappé warned against extremist power, saying he doesn’t want to represent a country that opposes his values. Marcus Thuram urged against supporting Marine Le Pen’s party.
Who is Kylian Mbappé?
Kylian Mbappé is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and the French national team.
Differences between Neo-Fascism and Ultra-Right
revives fascist principles, emphasising extreme nationalism, authoritarianism, and racial supremacy.
encompasses broader right-wing ideologies, focusing on nationalism, conservatism, and anti-immigration without necessarily adhering to fascist roots.
Neo-fascists often seek to mainstream their image, while ultra-right movements vary widely in intensity and focus on cultural and economic issues.
Key characteristics of Neofascism:
Ultra-nationalism:
Extreme patriotism and loyalty to one’s country
Racial supremacy:
Belief in the superiority of certain races over others
Populism:
Appealing to the interests and concerns of ordinary people, especially against a perceived elite establishment
Authoritarianism:
Favoring or enforcing strict obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom
Nativism:
Promoting the interests of native inhabitants against those of immigrants
Xenophobia:
Intense or irrational dislike or fear of people from other countries
Opposition to liberal democracy:
Rejecting the principles of liberal democracy such as individual rights, political pluralism and the rule of law
The spectre of the Ultra-Right and Neo-Fascism
Rise of the Ultra-Right in Europe:
The ultra-right and neo-fascism are gaining significant traction across Europe. The recent European Union (EU) elections saw substantial gains for ultra-right parties, indicating a shift in political dynamics.
Impact on French Politics:
Kylian Mbappé and Marcus Thuram’s comments highlight the concerns about the rise of extremist parties in France. Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) party has seen increasing support, posing a challenge to traditional political structures. Emmanuel Macron called for a snap parliamentary election in response to RN’s success, hoping to rally moderate and progressive voters.
European Context:
The spectre of nationalism and fascism is reminiscent of pre-World War II Europe. Timothy Garton Ash noted the irony of Europe celebrating liberation from fascism while facing a resurgence of similar ideologies.
Effect of the Growth of the Far Right Over the African and Asian Region
Anti-Immigration Sentiment:
The far-right’s rise is partly driven by opposition to immigration from Africa and Asia. This sentiment is a legacy of colonialism and has been exacerbated by recent socio-economic challenges.
Integration Challenges:
Prominent French footballers of African and Arab descent, like Kylian Mbappé and Karim Benzema, symbolize the integration issues within French society. Benzema’s quote, “If I score, I’m French… if I don’t, I’m an Arab,” underscores the conditional acceptance faced by immigrants and their descendants.
Policy Implications:
Far-right governments may implement stricter immigration policies, affecting migrants and refugees from Africa and Asia. These policies could lead to increased xenophobia and social divisions.
How French Elections Could Turn Out to Be a Change Point in Both French and European History
Potential Shift in Political Power:
The success of the RN in the French elections could signify a major shift in political power. If the RN wins the upcoming elections, it could lead to a reconfiguration of French politics, with far-reaching implications for Europe.
Influence on European Politics:
A far-right victory in France could embolden similar movements across Europe. The trend seen in Italy, Sweden, Germany, Spain, and other countries suggests a broader European shift towards the far-right.
Long-Term Implications:
The rise of the ultra-right could lead to significant changes in EU policies, particularly regarding immigration, national sovereignty, and international relations. Historical patterns suggest that while such political waves eventually stabilize, the impacts of this shift could be long-lasting and transformative for Europe.
Conclusion:
Need to Implement policies to reduce socio-economic disparities, focusing on marginalized communities, and creating opportunities for employment, education, and social mobility. Invest in social welfare programs to alleviate poverty and economic insecurity, which are often exploited by far-right movements to garner support.
Mains PYQ:
‘In the context of the neo-liberal paradigm of development planning, multi-level planning is expected to make operations cost-effective and remove many implementation blockages.” Discuss.

Prelims level:
British Parliamentary system
Mains level:
Impact on India-UK relations
Why in the news?
Keir Starmer
is poised to become the next Prime Minister of the UK, following Labour’s landmark victory securing a substantial majority.
Labour Party Comes to Power after 14 Years of Conservative Rule:
Electoral Outcome:
Labour secures a decisive victory in the UK elections, winning 412 seats in the House of Commons, ending 14 years of Conservative governance.
Majority:
Labour has achieved the largest majority in British politics since the early 20th century, with over 290 seats ahead of the Tories.
Voter Sentiment:
The election reflects a strong anti-conservative sentiment rather than a resounding endorsement of Labour, with significant losses in Conservative strongholds.
Strategic Shifts:
Labour’s success is attributed to strategic moves to appeal to rural and traditionally Conservative areas, contrasting with losses in urban and progressive strongholds.
Left and Right Streams in the UK:
Left Stream (Labour Party):
Traditionally advocates for social justice, welfare state policies, and government intervention in the economy to reduce inequality.Strong support from urban areas, progressive voters, trade unions, and historically marginalised groups such as minorities and low-income earners.
Under Keir Starmer, Labour has moved towards the centre, focusing on appealing to more rural and traditionally Conservative constituencies.
Right Stream (Conservative Party):
Favors free-market policies, limited government intervention, and emphasises individual responsibility and economic freedom. Strong support from affluent voters, business interests, rural communities, and traditionally conservative values such as patriotism and national sovereignty.
The Conservative Party has faced challenges with internal divisions over Brexit and criticism for austerity measures implemented during previous administrations.
Impact on India:
India-UK FTA:
The Labour Party has maintained its commitment to completing the FTA, though the timelines will remain uncertain for some time. Key sticking points include India’s demand for greater access for its skilled professionals in the UK market and the UK’s push for lower import duties on goods like Scotch whisky and electric vehicles.
Defence and Security Cooperation:
The India-UK defence and security partnership is likely to continue strengthening, building on recent momentum from the 2+2 mechanism and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s visit in early 2024. The UK is expected to maintain its support for a rules-based order and continue working with India to promote a “free and open Indo-Pacific”.
Visa Rules:
India has been in talks with the UK for the past few years to relax visa rules for its citizens. With the Labour Party coming into power, there might be some uncertainty around the progress of these discussions.
Carbon Tax:
While the FTA might reduce or eliminate tariffs, Indian exports could still face hefty carbon taxes, unlike UK exports to India. The Labour Party has always been in favour of imposing a carbon tax, which could impact Indian industries
Conclusion:
India should leverage diplomatic channels to strengthen economic cooperation with the UK under Keir Starmer’s leadership. This could include negotiating bilateral trade agreements, promoting investment opportunities, and collaborating on emerging sectors like technology and renewable energy.
Mains question for practice:
Q
Discuss the potential implications of Keir Starmer’s ascension to UK Prime Minister on India-UK relations.

Barriers to Financial Inclusion
Why in the News?
Reserve Bank’s Executive Director Neeraj Nigam highlighted that low labour force participation among women is a significant barrier to financial inclusion and broader economic growth.
He pointed out that only 7% of the outstanding loans to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are to women-led businesses.
Economic Participation
: Nigam emphasized that greater participation of women in economic activities is essential for financial inclusion and economic growth.
Participation Disparity
: Official data shows female labour force participation at 32.8% in FY22, compared to over 77% for men.
Credit Disparity
: Women-led businesses constitute nearly a fifth of MSMEs, yet they receive only 7% of the outstanding credit to this sector, highlighting a significant disparity.
Efforts and Challenges in Financial Inclusion
Successes and Gaps
: RBI ED expressed satisfaction with access to financial services, citing the success of the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) scheme and social security transfers.
Addressing Demand-side Issues
: While supply-side challenges have been addressed, demand-side issues still need attention.
Structural Barriers
: Structural issues such as low levels of capital, labour participation, societal norms restricting women from inheriting property, and limited access to education and training impede women’s financial inclusion.
Stereotyping and Behavioral Issues
Higher Risk Perception
: Nigam noted that women borrowers often face stereotyping by financiers, being considered higher risks, leading to higher interest rates, greater insistence on collateral, or outright loan rejections.
Behavioural Challenges
: He also mentioned behavioural issues among women borrowers, such as being more risk-averse, less confident in negotiating loan terms, and less likely to apply for new loans due to fear of rejection.
Policy Moves:
Priority Sector Lending and Financial Literacy Initiatives
Priority Sector Lending (PSL)
: The PSL mandate has become a viable business model for banks and micro-lenders, but demand-side constraints persist.
RBI Initiatives
: To address these challenges, the RBI has initiated financial inclusion efforts, including opening 2,400 financial literacy centres at the block level in partnership with nonprofits and requiring lead banks to have a literacy centre in each district.

A cave painting discovered in the
limestone cave of Leang Karampuang
on Sulawesi Island
, Indonesia, dates back at least 51,200 years.
The painting features a scene with
three part-human
part-animal figures
interacting with a
wild pig
, depicted in red pigment.
Study Details:
Published in the journal Nature, the study titled ‘Narrative cave art in Indonesia by 51,200 years ago’ used a new dating technique to determine the age of the artwork.
The study involved 23 researchers from Griffith University, Southern Cross University, and the Indonesian National Research and Innovation Agency.
Use of Uranium-based Dating:
A new dating technique utilizes
uranium series (U-series) analysis
on calcite deposits above cave art.
The laser-based analysis measures
uranium-thorium ratios
to accurately date paintings, highlighting significant age revisions for cave art in Sulawesi.
Leang Karampuang Cave is situated in the
Maros-Pangkep karst region
of South Sulawesi, Indonesia.
The cave is renowned for its
ancient rock art
and archaeological findings, providing insights into early human civilization in the region.
It features some of the
oldest known hand stencils

three smaller human-like figures
, all painted in a single shade of dark red pigment.
This painting
predates the cave art found in El Castillo, Spain
, dating back around 40,800 years ago, marking it as older than European cave paintings.
Significance of the Painting
According to researchers, the figures in the painting
depict dynamic action
, suggesting a
narrative or story being told.
The discovery pushes back the
origin of figurative art among Homo sapiens

**********What is Aphelion?
Solar system
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Mains level:
Does aphelion affect temperatures on Earth?
Why in the News?
Early on July 5, the
Earth reached aphelion
, its
farthest distance from the sun
in our year-long journey around our nearest star.
Aphelion is a term used in astronomy to denote the
point in the orbit
of a planet or celestial body
where it is farthest from the Sun.
The Earth’s orbit around the Sun is not a perfect circle but rather an
ellipse
, with the
situated at
one of the two foci
of the ellipse.
Aphelion marks the moment when
Earth is at its maximum distance
from the Sun along this elliptical path.
The concept of aphelion was crucial in
Johannes Kepler
‘s formulation of his
laws of planetary motio
n during the
17th century
How far is the Earth from the Sun at aphelion?
At aphelion, which occurs
around July 4
– 5th
each year, the Earth is approximately
152.1 million kilometers
(about 94.5 million miles) away from the Sun.
This distance is about
3.3% greater than its average distance
from the Sun, known as its
semi-major axis
, which is about
147.1 million kilometers
Aphelion has a
slight effect on temperatures on Earth
, but its impact is minimal compared to other factors such as axial tilt and atmospheric circulation patterns.
Despite being farther from the Sun during aphelion, the
Earth’s tilt
towards the Sun during the northern hemisphere’s summer results in warmer temperatures for that region.
This phenomenon is primarily responsible for the seasons on Earth.
What would happen if there were no aphelion?
If Earth’s
orbit were perfectly circular
, without aphelion or perihelion (the closest point to the Sun), the
distance between Earth and the Sun would remain constant
throughout the year.
This scenario would result in
less variation in seasonal temperatures
between the northern and southern hemispheres.
The distinct seasons that we experience today, which are
essential for ecological diversity
and agricultural cycles,
would be significantly altered
PYQ:
[2013]
Variations in the length of daytime and night time from season to season are due to-
(a) The earth’s rotation on its axis
(b) The earth’s revolution round the sun in an elliptical manner
(c) Latitudinal position of the place
(d) Revolution of the earth on a tilted axis
