REVERSING THE SLOWDOWN
Syllabus:
Mains – GS 3
Context:
With the new year around the corner, it is important to think ahead and recognize that the big economic issue in India in 2025 is likely to be the growth slowdown.
Background: –
For a rich country like the US with an annual per capita GDP of $86,000, slowing growth does not hurt a lot. But for a poor country like India, with a per capita GDP of only $2,700, slowdowns are painful and worrisome.
Key takeaways
The recently released GDP growth figures have triggered discussion over whether the slowdown is a temporary blip or a warning of a serious trend. Official statistics show that growth has declined in four out of the last five quarters.
Consumption demand has been subdued. Partly as a consequence, private investment has been weak. While government investment has been growing over the past few years, propping up demand, it is soon going to run into fiscal constraints.
There is one major opportunity for reigniting growth. India’s GDP is roughly $4 trillion while global GDP is a little more than $100 trillion. That means that India’s share of the global economy is around 4 per cent. But its share in global goods exports is much smaller, less than 2 per cent.
Assume that India decides to bring its export share in sync with its share in the global economy. If this could be achieved, it would do wonders for growth.
Many multinational companies are wanting to move out of China. And the only other country with a large population base and strong growth prospects is India.
There is now a historic opening to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in manufacturing, which all across Asia has been the key to increasing countries’ global export market share. The government, to its credit, has been trying to seize this opportunity by rolling out the well-funded Production Linked Incentives (PLI) subsidy scheme.
India should adopt a well-defined export-led growth strategy, the critical component of which would be minimising risk and policy uncertainty. To give an important example, the country needs a consistent and coherent trade policy that does not involve frequent changes in import tariffs or worse still, import or export bans.

CII SEEKS REFORMS IN INDIA’S PRIORITY SECTOR LENDING FRAMEWORK
Industry body CII has proposed reforms in India’s Priority Sector Lending (PSL) framework, suggesting the inclusion of emerging sectors and high-impact sectors like digital infrastructure, green initiatives, healthcare, and innovative manufacturing.
CII also suggested setting up of a high level committee to look at the revision of PSL norms and explore the need for any new Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) to cater to some of the new and emerging sectors.
Priority Sector Lending is a policy tool aimed at ensuring that key sectors crucial to the nation’s development receive adequate financial support.
Mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), PSL obligates banks to allocate a specified proportion of their loans to sectors such as agriculture, education, housing, and small industries etc.
Despite success, the PSL framework requires regular recalibration to remain relevant. This recalibration is essential to ensure that the financial resources are optimally distributed.
For instance, while agriculture contributes 14 per cent of the GDP today, its PSL allocation remains at 18 per cent, unchanged from when its GDP share exceeded 30 per cent.
Similarly, sectors like infrastructure and innovative manufacturing lack adequate PSL focus despite their potential to drive economic growth.

INDIA’S RELIANCE ON CHINA FOR CRITICAL MINERALS
Mains – GS 2
The Ministry of Mines has identified 30 critical minerals. While it highlighted India’s complete import dependency for 10 critical minerals, it did not fully address a more pressing concern — the extent and nature of dependency on China.
Transitioning away from China will require sustained investment and long-term commitment.
Is China a dominant player?
China’s unparalleled dominance in critical minerals stems from its vast resource base and strategic investments across the value chain.
Reserves of minerals, particularly copper, lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, lithium, gallium, germanium, and crystalline graphite, increased significantly, supported by robust exploration investment.
China’s dominance extends beyond reserves to include processing and refining, with control over 87% of rare earth processing, 58% of lithium refining, and 68% of silicon processing.
Furthermore, China has strategically invested in overseas mining projects and built unparalleled midstream refining capabilities, raising supply chain vulnerabilities for countries including India, the U.S., and EU nations.
What about China’s export controls?
When it comes to China’s approach to weaponising critical mineral exports, it is strategic and calculated.
Beijing primarily targets minerals deemed critical by West and their allies, especially those essential for semiconductors, batteries, and high-tech manufacturing. However, China carefully balances these decisions against two constraining factors: it avoids controlling minerals which heavily depend on Western raw material imports, and it refrains from actions that could disrupt its domestic industry or export-dependent sectors. This strategy was evident in China’s 2010 rare earth embargo against Japan, its recent restrictions on antimony, gallium, and germanium exports, and its December 2023 ban on rare earth extraction and processing technologies.
Is India dependent on China?
An in-depth examination of import data of 30 critical minerals spanning 2019 to 2024 reveals India’s acute vulnerability to Chinese supplies, particularly for six critical minerals where dependency exceeds 40%: bismuth (85.6%), lithium (82%), silicon (76%), titanium (50.6%), tellurium (48.8%), and graphite (42.4%).
Why does India rely on imports?
India’s heavy reliance on imports stem from several structural challenges in its mining and processing ecosystem.
Many critical minerals are deep-seated, requiring high-risk investments in exploration and mining technologies — a factor that has deterred private sector participation in the absence of adequate incentives and policy support.
The country’s processing capabilities are also limited. This is particularly evident in the case of the recently discovered lithium deposits in Jammu and Kashmir, where despite the presence of 5.9 million tonnes of resources in clay deposits, India lacks the technological capability to extract lithium from such geological formations.
What is the way forward?
India has initiated a multi-pronged approach to reduce its dependency on China.
The government has established KABIL, a joint venture of three State-owned companies, to secure overseas mineral assets.
India has also joined strategic initiatives like the Minerals Security Partnership and the Critical Raw Materials Club to diversify its supply sources and strengthen partnerships.
The country is also investing in research through institutions like the Geological Survey of India and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research while promoting recycling and circular economy practices to reduce virgin mineral dependency.

**********The GATT-ification of the World Trade Organisation
Context
World Trade Organisation (WTO), headquartered in Geneva, was established in 1995
as a monumental step towards a rule-based international trading system.
However,
it now finds itself in a precarious position, unable to fulfil its promise of a comprehensive dispute settlement mechanism
and the paralysis of its Appellate Body (
AB
) is emblematic of deeper systemic issues that threaten the WTO’s relevance in global trade.
Now it becomes imperative to critically examine the origins of the WTO’s decline, the geopolitical factors influencing its dysfunction
, and the implications for global trade.
The Origins of WTO’s Decline
This
obstruction began during Barack Obama’s administration
, escalated under Donald Trump’s first presidency, and has continued under President Joe Biden.
It
reflects a bipartisan political consensus in the U.S. The U.S.’s hostile stance towards the AB
will intensify further under what is anticipated to be a highly protectionist Trump 2.0 administration.
The WTO panels
, the first stage of dispute settlement,
continue to operate and render decisions resolving trade disputes between WTO member countries.
this is of little significance because the losing country uses its legal prerogative to appeal to a non-operational AB,
and thus stall the adjudicatory process.
It is a fool’s errand to put the AB back on track
because the real issue is the WTO’s existential crisis and its quest to be a relevant player in global trade.
larger game is not about killing the AB but, rather, making the WTO dysfunctional.
An Analysis of the Promising Beginning of the WTO
The Evolution from GATT to WTO
establishment of the WTO in 1995 marked a historic transition
from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
sought to address the limitations of its predecessor by shifting from voluntary compliance
to enforceable legal commitments.
change reflected the global embrace of neoliberal principles, including market liberalisation and deregulation.
A Comprehensive Rule-Based Framework
WTO extended its reach beyond trade in goods to encompass services and intellectual property
, introducing agreements such as GATS and TRIPS.
comprehensive framework aimed to harmonise global trade practices
and ensure stability and predictability in international markets.
The Innovation of a Two-Tier Dispute Settlement System
One of the WTO’s key innovations was its
two-tier dispute settlement mechanism, featuring a binding adjudicatory process and an appellate function.
This mechanism
enhanced impartiality and rigor,
positioning the WTO as a pioneer in international legal adjudication.
The Optimism Surrounding Rule-Based Trade
WTO’s legal framework inspired confidence
in its ability to transcend political diplomacy.
Scholars viewed it as a constitutional project that prioritised the rule of law
, with countries ceding sovereignty to create a more stable and predictable trading system.
Early Successes and Stabilizing Global Trade
During its early years,
the WTO achieved significant milestones, including resolving trade disputes,
and facilitating market access through initiatives like the Information Technology Agreement.
These
successes reinforced its role as a stabilising force in the global economy.
A Symbol of Global Cooperation and Equity
More than a trade body,
the WTO represented a commitment to cooperation and shared prosperity.
Its principles of non-discrimination, transparency, and enforceability empowered smaller and developing nations
, ensuring a fairer global trade system and solidifying its initial appeal.
The Unravelling of the WTO
The Rise of China and Decline of WTO
The optimism surrounding the WTO
began to dissipate with the rise of China as a global economic power.
China's accession to the WTO in 2001, facilitated by the United States, was driven by the expectation that Beijing would adopt free-market principles
and dismantle its state-led industrial policies.
this transformation did not materialize, instead, the U.S. perceived that China exploited the WTO system
to gain an unfair advantage, exacerbating trade imbalances and industrial policy conflicts.
The Shift in US Policy Towards WTO
disillusionment prompted a shift in U.S. policy
, particularly during Donald Trump’s presidency, where unilateral measures such as a 25% tariff on Chinese goods were imposed in 2018, bypassing WTO rules.
Appellate Body, a key pillar of the WTO’s dispute settlement system, became a casualty of this geopolitical struggle.
Since 2019,
the U.S. has blocked appointments to the AB, rendering it non-operational and stalling dispute resolution.
obstruction reflects a bipartisan consensus in the U.S., with current President Joe Biden continuing the policy,
signalling a broader disinterest in reviving the WTO’s adjudicatory mechanisms.
The Shift from Legalism to Politics
The decline of the Appellate Body is
not merely a technical issue but a symptom of a larger transformation in international trade governance.
As legal scholar Geraldo Vidigal argues,
the crisis represents a regime change rather than a temporary setback.
The thick legal framework established in 1995 is being replaced by a ‘thinning of legality,’
as states reclaim sovereignty over trade policies.
The GATTification of WTO: Reversal of WTO’s Founding Principles
This regression,
termed the GATTification of the WTO,
indicates a
return to the less formal, diplomacy-driven mechanisms of the GATT era.
S. seeks to dismantle the WTO’s institutional controls to confront China
without legal constraints.
For instance,
future U.S. administrations, including a potential Trump 2.0 presidency, are expected to pursue protectionist policies
that may escalate trade wars.
This shift underscores the resurgence of international politics over law in shaping trade relations.
Implications for Global Trade
The WTO’s weakening
holds profound implications for the global trading system.
Without a functioning dispute settlement system,
the enforcement of trade rules becomes a matter of political leverage rather than legal adjudication.
undermines trust in multilateralism and incentivises unilateral actions
, increasing the risk of trade wars and economic fragmentation.
Moreover,
the erosion of the WTO’s authority coincides with the rise of regional trade agreements and bilateral deals,
which often exclude weaker nations and exacerbate inequalities.
return to a GATT-like system raises questions about the future of global trade governance
and whether the WTO can adapt to the changing geopolitical landscape.
Conclusion
The WTO’s inability to restore its dispute settlement
system by 2024
reflects a broader existential crisis.
While the paralysis of the Appellate Body is a pressing issue,
the root cause lies in the shifting dynamics of global power, particularly the U.S.-China rivalry.
transition from a rule-based to a politically-driven trade regime marks a reversal of the WTO’s founding principles.

to bitumen, or asphalt.
It is designed to
lower the carbon footprint of road construction.
It is made
using non-petroleum-based renewable resources
and can be made from vegetable oils, synthetic polymers, or both, making it a more sustainable model long term.
Advantages:
Sustainable:
It is generated from renewable materials. This makes it a more environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum-based bitumen, which is derived from limited resources.
Low Carbon Footprint:
As it is derived from organic materials that have absorbed carbon dioxide during their development, it often has a lower environmental impact than standard bitumen.
Improved environmental performance:
It is less toxic and detrimental to the environment than regular bitumen. It contains fewer heavy metals and other hazardous pollutants.
Applications:
It is versatile and may be utilised in a variety of applications, including
road paving, roofing, and waterproofing.
What is Bitumen?
It is a dense, highly viscous,
petroleum-based hydrocarbon.
It is found in deposits
such as oil sands and pitch lakes
(natural bitumen) or is obtained as a residue of the distillation of crude oil.

**********Cephalopods
Cephalopods, including cuttlefish, squid, and octopus, demonstrate cognitive skills inspiring debates on their treatment.
About Cephalopods:
Cephalopods are the
most intelligent
, most mobile, and the largest of all molluscs.
They are the most morphologically and behaviorally complex class in
phylum Mollusca.
Squid, octopuses, cuttlefish, the chambered nautilus
, and their relatives display remarkable diversity in size and lifestyle with adaptations for predation, locomotion, disguise, and communication.
These "
brainy" invertebrates
have evolved suckered tentacles, camera-like eyes, color-changing skin, and complex learning behavior.
Their lengthy evolutionary history spans an impressive 500 million years and the abundant fossils they've left behind record repeated speciation and extinction events.
Characteristics:
They are characterized by a
completely merged head and foot
, with a ring of arms and/or tentacles surrounding the head. The arms, tentacles, and funnel are all derivatives of the foot.
Locomotion in cephalopods is accomplished mainly by jet propulsion.
All cephalopods

some feed passively on floating debris
They possess
well-developed nervous systems
and complex sensory organs.
contain pigment-rich cells
in the epidermis surrounded by cells containing contractile fibers.
One of the highly complex behaviours that many cephalopods show is
visual camouflage.
They can open and close tiny sacs just below their skin that contain coloured pigments and reflectors, revealing specific colours.
Australian giant cuttlefish
, Sepia apama, uses its chromatophores to communicate, creating patterns that attract mates and warn off aggressors.
This ability can also come in handy for hunting; many cephalopods
are ambush predators
that blend into the background or even lure their prey.
Some Cephalopods live alone in the nearly
featureless darkness of the deep ocean
; others live socially on
active, sunny coral reefs.
Some cephalopods may be capable of more complicated forms of learning, such as
reversal learning
– learning to flexibly adjust behaviour when different stimuli signal reward.

**********Why Growth of India’s Green Cover Raises Environmental Concerns
Why in news?
The 18th biennial
State of Forest Report (ISFR-2023)
highlights a marginal gain of
156 sq km in forest cover
and a significant increase of
1,289 sq km in tree cover
since 2021.
For the first time, India’s green cover has surpassed the
25% threshold
, with
8,27,357 sq km (25.17%)
of the country under
forest (21.76%)
tree (3.41%)
cover. Dense forests constitute
4,10,175 sq km
of the total.
What’s in today’s article?
Trends in Forest and Tree Cover Growth
Forests within forest
Forest Balance Sheet: Insights from ISFR-2023
Implications of Forest Cover Trends
Calculation
Since 2001,
tree patches smaller than 1 hectare
have been measured separately as
The latest ISFR-2023 report shows the
sharpest growth in tree cover
, rising from
2.91% in 2021 to 3.41%
in 2023, marking a
0.5 percentage point increase in two years
In contrast,
forest cover growth has slowed
, increasing by only
0.05 percentage points
This aligns with the diminishing growth trend since forest cover surpassed the
20% threshold
in the early 2000s.
Between 2003 and 2013, forest cover grew by
0.61 percentage points
(from 20.62% to 21.23%).
On the other hand, the next decade saw only a
0.53 percentage point increase
to 21.76%.
Classification of Forest Types in India
In India,
tree patches measuring 1 hectare or more
with a
minimum canopy cover of 10%
are classified as forests, irrespective of land use or ownership.
Forests are categorized based on canopy density:
Very Dense Forests (VDF):
Canopy density ≥ 70% (classified since 2003).
Dense Forests:
Canopy density ≥ 40%.
Open Forests (OF):
Canopy density between 10-40%.
Non-Forest (NF):
Areas with < 10% canopy density, including shrubs.
Dynamic Changes in Forest Density
Forests undergo transitions across density categories due to factors like
climate
biotic pressure
. For example:
may thin to a
Moderately Dense Forest (MDF)
An
may improve to an
Forests may degrade to
shrub areas
, indicating deforestation.
Limitations of Aggregated Data
While aggregated data reflects the quantum of different forest types, it fails to capture the
dynamic transformation of forests
, where
natural forests degrade, disappear, or are replaced by plantations
Plantations often grow faster but do not replicate the ecological richness of natural forests.
Tracking Forest Change
Since 2003, ISFR reports include a
“change matrix”
, detailing forest transitions across categories.
This data highlights
broad trends over two decades
, reflecting the dynamic nature of forest ecosystems.
Dense Forest Losses (2003-2023)
India has lost
24,651 sq km
(6.3%) of its dense forests since 2003, equivalent to nearly half the size of Punjab.
Key trends:
2021-2023:
3,913 sq km lost (larger than Goa).
2013-2023:
17,500 sq km lost.
2003-2013:
7,151 sq km lost.
Plantation Gains Offset Dense Forest Losses
Rapid transformation of
15,530 sq km of non-forested or scantly forested land
to dense forests over the past two decades has offset these losses.
Experts suggest these gains are predominantly
, as natural forests do not grow this quickly.
1,420 sq km of plantations became dense forests.
Management and Density Improvements
Better management practices have allowed
Open Forests (OFs)
to improve into
Moderately Dense Forests (MDFs)
over the last decade.
Combined with plantation gains, this has kept the dense forest cover largely stable.
The “change matrix” records a net increase of
1,370 sq km of dense forest
between 2003-2023.
716 sq km of gains
were recorded in the 2021-2023 cycle alone.
Data Revisions and Paper Gains
India’s dense forest cover officially grew by
21,601 sq km (6%)
However, this figure includes
20,232 sq km of revisions
made in previous ISFR reports (2005, 2009, 2015, and 2021), raising questions about the accuracy of these gains.
Key Observation
While plantations and management practices stabilize dense forest cover on paper, the ongoing
disappearance of natural dense forests
highlights the need for improved conservation measures.
Criticism of Plantation-Based Forest Growth
The apparent growth in forest cover through the
replacement of natural dense forests with plantations
has drawn criticism from experts.
Key issues include:
Uniformity and Vulnerability:
Plantations typically consist of trees of the same age and species, making them susceptible to
fire, pests, and epidemics
Barrier to Natural Regeneration:
Plantations hinder the regrowth of
biodiverse natural forests
, which provide a broader range of ecological benefits.
Ecological Superiority of Natural Forests
Natural forests outperform plantations in several ways:
Biodiversity:
Natural forests support more species and complex ecosystems.
Carbon Stock:
They store significantly more carbon, both in trees and soil, compared to plantations.
Climate Challenges of Plantation Forests
Rapid Growth Assumption:
In 2018, the
UNFCCC
flagged India’s assumption that plantations reach the carbon stock level of natural forests in
just eight years
, which is unrealistic.
Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Risks:
Plantations grow quickly and are promoted to meet carbon targets. However, they are often
harvested prematurely
, undermining long-term climate goals.
Conclusion
While plantations may stabilize forest cover on paper and provide short-term carbon benefits, they fail to replicate the ecological and climate advantages of old natural forests, emphasizing the need for better conservation strategies.

**********Bangladesh’s Extradition Request for Sheikh Hasina
Why in news?
Bangladesh has formally requested India to extradite former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India on August 5 following massive protests that ended her 16-year rule. Dhaka sent a diplomatic note to New Delhi, citing the need for Hasina to face judicial processes for alleged crimes against humanity and genocide.
The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Dhaka has issued arrest warrants against Hasina and several of her former ministers and officials.
What’s in today’s article?
Extradition treaty between India and Bangladesh
Extradition Request by Bangladesh
Can Hasina be extradited by Bangladesh?
Treaty signed in 2013
It was signed to address fugitives operating across borders in both countries.
It was established due to concerns over Indian insurgents, particularly from the North East, hiding in Bangladesh, and Bangladeshi militants.
Many Bangladeshi militants such as those from Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), sought refuge in Indian states like West Bengal and Assam.
It provides the legal framework for extradition but does not mandate compliance in all cases.
Key provisions of the treaty
The extradition treaty between India and Bangladesh mandates that both countries extradite individuals who:
have been charged with, found guilty of, or
are wanted for committing an extraditable offence by a court in the requesting country.
An extraditable offence, as defined by the treaty, is
one that carries a minimum punishment of one year imprisonment
, including financial crimes.
For an offence to be considered extraditable, the
principle of dual criminality
must apply, meaning
the offence must be punishable in both countries
The treaty also allows for extradition in cases involving attempts to commit, aiding, abetting, inciting, or participating as an accomplice in an extraditable offence.
Provisions for Refusal
Extradition may be refused if the offence is of a “political nature.”
Some crimes, such as murder, enforced disappearance, and torture, are excluded from being categorized as political offences under the treaty.
Article 8
): Grounds for refusal also include accusations not made “in good faith in the interests of justice” or military offences not considered general criminal law violations.
Amendment in 2016 to Simplify Extradition Process
Requirement to provide evidence of the offence was removed; only an arrest warrant from a competent court is now required.
Sheikh Hasina faces multiple arrest warrants issued in Bangladesh, making her case eligible under the amended treaty.
About the news:
Bangladesh has sent a diplomatic note asking New Delhi to send back its former PM Sheikh Hasina.
India’s Response and Treaty Provisions
Ministry of External Affairs confirmed receiving the request but has not yet commented on the matter.
Indian officials have stated they will examine the legal grounds before making a decision.
Strained Bilateral Relations
Hasina’s presence in India and her public statements have strained relations between the two countries.
In her public address from India, Hasina accused the interim government of genocide and persecution of minorities, including Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians.
She alleged that during the protests, minority places of worship were attacked, and leaders of minority communities were persecuted.
Hasina called for justice, demanding investigations into the killings and acts of violence.
Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Chief Advisor Prof Muhammad Yunus, has expressed concerns over Hasina’s statements made from India, which they believe create tension.
Yunus has urged India to help “clear the clouds” over the bilateral relationship.
Impact on Regional Dynamics
The extradition request and the political developments surrounding Hasina’s asylum in India have the potential to influence India-Bangladesh relations significantly, requiring deft diplomatic handling by both nations.
India can refuse extradition, citing lack of “good faith” or justice-related concerns.
Experts highlight that the decision to extradite Hasina is
ultimately political rather than legal
. But this has the
potential to adversely impact New Delhi’s relations with Dhaka’s new ruling dispensation.

**********India’s Reliance on China for Critical Minerals: Challenges and Opportunities
What’s in Today’s Article?
Overview (Context of the Article)
About Critical Minerals (Meaning, China’s Dominance, Export Strategy, India’s Dependency on China, etc.)
Way Forward
Overview:
In 2023, the Ministry of Mines identified 30 critical minerals essential for India's economic development and national security.
The report highlighted a complete import dependency for 10 critical minerals but fell short of addressing India's reliance on China—a dominant player in the global critical minerals ecosystem.
This reliance raises strategic vulnerabilities and the need for alternative strategies.
What are Critical Minerals?
Critical minerals are raw materials essential for economic and national security, often used in
high-tech industries
renewable energy technologies
They are typically rare, difficult to mine and substitute, and often vulnerable to supply chain disruptions due to limited global production and geopolitical factors.
The growing demand for these minerals, driven by technological advancements and the global transition to green energy, underscores their critical importance.
Securing a stable supply of critical minerals is thus a strategic priority for many countries to ensure economic stability and technological progress.
China’s Dominance in Critical Minerals:
Vast Resources
: China has discovered 173 types of minerals, including:
13 energy minerals
59 metallic minerals
95 non-metallic minerals
Strategic Investments
: With $19.4 billion invested in exploration in 2023, China discovered 132 new mineral deposits, including 34 large ones.
Processing Capabilities
: Dominates processing and refining:
Rare earths: 87%
Lithium: 58%
Silicon: 68%
Global Investments
: Strategic stakes in overseas mining projects amplify its control over supply chains.
China's Export Strategy:
China strategically controls critical mineral exports, particularly targeting those crucial for semiconductors, batteries, and high-tech manufacturing. Key examples include:
2010 Rare Earth Embargo
: Against Japan
Restrictions on Gallium, Germanium, and Antimony
: Recent targeted actions
Ban on Rare Earth Technologies (2023)
: To protect domestic interests
China avoids actions that might:
Disrupt its export-dependent industries
Undermine its reliance on Western-imported raw materials
India's Dependency on China:
India’s import data (2019-2024) reveals high dependency on Chinese supplies for six critical minerals:
Bismuth (85.6%)
: Vital for pharmaceuticals and chemicals
Lithium (82%)
: Core to EV batteries and energy storage
Silicon (76%)
: Crucial for semiconductors and solar panels
Titanium (50.6%)
: Key for aerospace and defense
Tellurium (48.8%)
: Used in solar and thermoelectric devices
Graphite (42.4%)
: Indispensable for EV batteries and steel production
China's dominant global production shares in these minerals underscore India's supply chain vulnerabilities.
Why India Relies on Imports?
Despite abundant mineral resources, structural challenges hinder India’s mining and processing ecosystem:
Technological Barriers
Limited ability to extract minerals like lithium from clay deposits in Jammu & Kashmir, despite having 5.9 million tonnes of resources.
Investment Gaps
High-risk investments in exploration deter private sector participation.
Policy Shortcomings
Lack of incentives and advanced mining technologies limit domestic production capabilities.
Strategic Way Forward:
Securing Overseas Assets
The government established
KABIL
(Khanij Bidesh India Limited) to acquire overseas mineral resources.
International Collaborations
Partnerships through the
Minerals Security Partnership
Critical Raw Materials Club
aim to diversify supply sources.
Research and Development
Institutions like the
Geological Survey of India
CSIR
are advancing technologies for exploration and processing.
Promoting Recycling
Circular economy initiatives and production-linked incentives focus on recycling critical minerals to reduce dependency.
Policy Reforms
Introducing incentives to attract private investment and updating mining regulations to encourage domestic exploration.
Conclusion:
India’s transition from dependence on China requires sustained investment, technological advancements, and global partnerships.
While government initiatives show promise, long-term commitment and proactive policies will be critical for securing a self-reliant future in critical minerals.

**********Looking at 2025, The Economy: Some positives, some concerns
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Indian economy;
Why in the News?
The Finance Minister describes the slowdown in Q2 growth as a “temporary blip,” while the RBI has revised its GDP growth forecast for 2024-25 downward, from 7.2% to 6.6%.
Why RBI has revised its GDP growth forecast for 2024-2025 downward, from 7.2% to 6.6%?
Economic Slowdown
: The RBI’s downgrade reflects concerns over a cyclical downturn, with GDP growth in Q2 FY25 at 5.4%, indicating fundamental challenges hindering growth prospects.
Fundamental challenges:
Declining corporate investments, sliding consumption growth, and “softness” in urban demand have weakened the investment climate, prompting a downward revision in growth expectations.
Inflationary Pressures
: Persistent inflation near double digits complicates monetary policy, forcing the RBI to consider prolonged high interest rates, which could further suppress growth and investments.
What are the expected growth rates for major economies in 2025?
India:
Projected to achieve a growth rate of 6.5% over the next five years, maintaining its status as the fastest-growing major economy globally, despite a recent dip in economic output in 2024.
China
: Growth is expected to stabilize around
4-5%
, lower than its historical rates due to structural challenges like demographic shifts and a cooling property sector.
United States
: Growth is projected at
1.5-2%
, as the Federal Reserve maintains a tight monetary policy to counter inflation.
Eurozone
: Growth is forecasted at around
1%
, reflecting a sluggish recovery from the energy crisis and geopolitical uncertainties.
Japan
: Expected growth rate of
1-1.5%
, supported by fiscal stimulus but constrained by aging demographics.
Emerging Markets (excluding China and India)
: Growth is expected to range from
3-4%
, depending on commodity prices and fiscal discipline.
How will inflation and monetary policy evolve?
Inflation Persistence:
Inflation in India remains at the upper end of the permissible range, with food prices nearing double digits. This persistent inflation strengthens the argument for maintaining high interest rates, complicating the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monetary policy decisions as they balance growth with inflation control.
Monetary Policy Adjustments:
The RBI may need to reconsider its previous projections of GDP growth, which could lead to adjustments in interest rates. If inflation continues to be a concern, the RBI might maintain or even increase rates longer than necessary which impacts investment and economic activity.
Investment and Economic Recovery:
A slowdown in corporate investments and a decline in household financial savings have been observed, which could hinder economic recovery.
The RBI’s ability to stimulate growth through monetary policy will depend on addressing these investment challenges and ensuring that fiscal measures effectively support economic activity without exacerbating inflation.
What are the key risks and uncertainties facing the global economy?
Investment Slowdown:
A significant challenge is the sluggish performance of corporate investments, exacerbated by high food inflation and muted urban demand. This trend poses risks for growth and job creation.
Savings-Investment Gap:
A decline in household financial savings down to 5.3% of GDP from 7.3% coupled with rising household debt (5.8% of GDP) presents a risk to economic stability1.
Credit Growth Decline:
Falling credit growth, particularly in household borrowing for home purchases and limited industrial appetite for new projects, indicates a tightening economic environment.
Fiscal Challenges:
Increased state expenditures on subsidies may strain fiscal resources, potentially affecting overall economic sustainability and growth prospects.
What should be done by the government? (Way forward)
Balanced Fiscal and Monetary Coordination
: Governments should prioritize targeted fiscal measures to stimulate investment and demand while ensuring fiscal discipline, complemented by a flexible monetary policy that carefully balances inflation control with growth stimulation.
Boosting Household Savings and Investments
: Implement policies to encourage higher household financial savings and incentivize corporate investments through tax reforms, reduced regulatory barriers, and support for credit access in productive sectors.
Mains PYQ:
The nature of economic growth in India in recent times is often described as jobless growth. Do you agree with this view? Give arguments in favour of your answer.

About Mumps Disease
Mumps is a contagious viral infection caused by the
mumps virus
, primarily affecting the salivary glands, leading to swelling near the ears (parotitis), fever, headache, and muscle aches.
It spreads through respiratory droplets or direct contact with saliva.
While often mild, complications can include
orchitis
(testicular inflammation),
oophoritis
(ovarian inflammation), encephalitis, or hearing loss.
There is no specific treatment, but supportive care like rest, hydration, and pain management helps.
Vaccination with the
MMR vaccine
is the best prevention, offering 78–88% protection.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
first bio-bitumen-
based
stretch was inaugurated on
NH-44 in Mansar, Nagpur, Maharashtra
by
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari
.
About Bio-Bitumen
Bio-bitumen is a
bio-based binder
derived from renewable, sustainable
sources
such as: Vegetable oils, Crop stubble, Algae, Lignin (a component of wood), Animal manure.
It serves as an
alternative to traditional bitumen
, which is primarily derived from the
distillation of crude oil
The production of bio-bitumen
reduces dependence on petroleum
and is a step toward sustainable road construction and infrastructure development.
Significance and Features of Bio-Bitumen:
Bio-bitumen reduces the
carbon footprint
associated with the traditional bitumen production process.
By using renewable sources such as
lignin
(a byproduct of wood), it helps mitigate environmental concerns like
stubble burning
and contributes to
lower greenhouse gas emissions
, potentially by as much as
70%
compared to fossil-based bitumen.
India, which heavily imports traditional bitumen, can reduce its import dependency by switching to bio-bitumen made from
locally available materials
The use of bio-bitumen stimulates
bio-refineries
, creating opportunities for
revenue generation
and providing economic benefits to
farmers
and the
bio-refining industry
India’s Bitumen Scenario:
India imports
around 50%
of its total annual bitumen requirements, which amounted to
3.21 million tonnes
in FY 2023-24.
The country produced
5.24 million tonnes
of bitumen in the same period.
India’s bitumen consumption has been steadily increasing, averaging
7.7 million tonnes annually
over the past five years.
In 2023-24, India constructed around
12,300 km
of national highways, averaging nearly
34 km per day
