**********Asperger’s Syndrome
Recently, on the occasion of International Asperger’s Day, the National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (NIEPID) organized various programmes to raise awareness and promote inclusivity for individuals with Asperger’s Syndrome.
About Asperger’s Syndrome:
It is a
neurodevelopmental disorder
within the family of autism spectrum disorder.
It is characterized by
impaired social communication and interaction
, average or superior intelligence, and no significant language delay.
It was
first described by Hans Asperger in 1944
as the behavioral characterization of individuals with difficulties in communication and social interaction.
Symptoms of Asperger Syndrome:
The symptoms of Asperger Syndrome typically manifest in
early childhood and can persist into adulthood.
These symptoms often vary in severity and can include:
Social Difficulties
, Repetitive Behaviors, Communication Challenges,
Motor Coordination Difficulties.
It also includes engaging in one-sided, long-winded conversations, without noticing if the listener is listening or trying to change the subject and displaying unusual nonverbal communication, such as lack of eye contact, few facial expressions, or awkward body postures and gestures.
Causes of Asperger Syndrome:
Doctors and researchers do not understand what causes Asperger’s syndrome.
Treatment:
The core signs of Asperger’s syndrome can’t be cured. But most children benefit from early specialised interventions that focus on
behavior management and social skills training

**********Perovskite Nanocrystal
Recently, researchers at the Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences (CeNS) in Bengaluru have developed an innovative method to minimize anion migration in CsPbX₃ perovskite nanocrystals.
About Perovskite Nanocrystal:
It is a material that has
the same crystal structure
as the mineral calcium
titanium oxide (CaTiO3).
Generally, perovskite compounds have a
chemical formula ABX3
, where ‘A’ and ‘B’ represent
cations
, and X is
an anion
that bonds to both.
A large number of different elements can be combined together to form perovskite structures.
Due to its compositional flexibility, scientists can design perovskite crystals to have a wide variety of
physical, optical and electrical characteristics
from insulating, semiconducting, metallic and superconducting characteristics.
Applications of Perovskite Nanocrystal:
They have applications in various fields of
optoelectronics, including photovoltaic solar cells
, photodetectors,
light-emitting devices,
Perovskite LEDs, which combine the advantages of OLEDs and QLEDs, have long been considered a promising technology
for next-generation lighting

**********Extinction Filtering
Recent study finds that human activities outside protected areas are driving biodiversity loss and extinction filtering is affecting sensitive species.
About Extinction Filtering:
It is the process where
species sensitive to human disturbance disappear
, leaving only those that can survive in degraded landscapes.
It predicts that species that have evolved and survived in high-disturbance environments should be more likely to
persist in the face of new disturbances
, including those of habitat loss and fragmentation.
Impact on biodiversity:
It results in a
less diverse and more uniform mix of species
in tropical forests.
Over time, this weakens entire ecosystems and reduces their ability to recover from environmental changes.
The recent study suggests the existence of anthropogenic extinction filtering acting on mammals in tropical forests, whereby human overpopulation has driven the most sensitive species to local extinction while remaining ones are able to persist.
The problem of "extinction filtering" is not unique to tropical forests. Across the world, human activities are affecting wildlife inside protected areas.

**********Purchasing Managers’ Index
Recently, India’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose for first time after three quarters.
About Purchasing Managers’ Index:
It is an indicator of business activity - both in the
manufacturing and services sectors.
It is a survey-based measure that asks the respondents about changes in their perception of some key business variables from the month before.
It is calculated separately for the
and then
a composite index is constructed.
The index helps in determining whether the market conditions, as seen by purchasing managers, is expanding, contracting or staying the same.
There are two types of PMI —
Manufacturing PMI and Services PMI.
How is the manufacturing PMI derived?
It is derived by sending fact-based questions to a large number of companies in the concerned sector.
The questions are
related to 5 key variables
— new orders, output employment, suppliers’ delivery times and stock of items purchased
The surveys are conducted on a
monthly basis
A PMI number
greater than 50 indicates expansion
in business activity.
A number
less than 50 shows contraction
. The rate of expansion is also judged by the difference from the mid-point (50) and also by previous month’s data.
PMI data for India is
released by S&P Global

**********How a Tamil Magazine Became Inaccessible in India
Why in the News?
Recently, a Tamil magazine’s website was blocked by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) after publishing controversial cartoon, sparking outrage and legal challenges.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context, Background, Laws for Website Blocking, etc.)
Blocking Mechanism (How Vikatan got Blocked, Implications, Way Ahead, etc.)
Introduction:
On
February 15, 2025
Vikatan’s website became inaccessible
for many users following a complaint by
BJP Tamil Nadu President K. Annamalai
to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB).
The complaint was triggered by a cartoon depicting Prime Minister Narendra Modi alongside former U.S. President Donald Trump, referring to the deportation of migrants from the U.S. to India.
While the
Union Government did not officially confirm or deny the website blocking
, sources revealed that the
Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued the directive based on MIB’s instructions
The incident has sparked a debate on digital censorship and press freedom in India.
Background:
The February 10 edition of
Vikatan Plus (the magazine’s digital version)
published a
cartoon portraying PM Modi in shackles
, symbolizing the forcible deportation of Indian migrants from the U.S..
BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit viewed the illustration as offensive
, prompting Annamalai to demand action. Following the complaint:
The MIB directed the DoT to block Vikatan’s website, resulting in restricted access on multiple internet networks.
No official public statement or notice was issued explaining the reason for the blocking.
The magazine, along with political figures like Tamil Nadu CM M.K. Stalin, condemned the move as an attack on press freedom.
Legal Basis for Website Blocking in India:
The government can legally
block websites under Section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000
, which allows restrictions in cases of:
Threat to national security, sovereignty, and public order.
Defamation or incitement of violence.
blocking process is confidential
, and affected websites often receive no formal notice.
Blocking Mechanism Under Indian Law:
2009 IT Blocking Rules
Ministries or state departments can recommend website blocking to a designated IT officer.
A review committee decides on the action, and the DoT directs telecom providers to enforce the block.
2021 IT Rules (Intermediary Guidelines & Digital Media Ethics Code)
Empower the I&B and IT Ministries to issue emergency content removal orders.
Unlike Section 69A, which blocks entire websites, these rules focus on specific content takedowns.
Since most websites
now use HTTPS encryption
blocking individual pages is challenging
unless the publisher removes them voluntarily.
How Vikatan was Blocked:
Telecom operators restricted access to Vikatan's website after receiving DoT orders.
was not given prior notice
, violating the usual
2009 blocking procedure
February 16
, Vikatan received a separate notice under the 2021 IT Rules, addressing the cartoon’s content but not the full website block.
hearing was scheduled for February 20
, where Vikatan defended its case, stating it violates press freedom principles.
Implications for Press Freedom and Digital Rights:
Lack of Transparency in Website Blocking
No public acknowledgment of the order has been made by the government.
Blocking orders under Section 69A are confidential, reducing accountability.
Rising Concerns Over Political Censorship
Critics argue that website blocking is being used as a political tool rather than for national security concerns.
Press organizations worry that restrictions on digital media are increasing.
Press Freedom vs. Government Regulation
Media houses argue that Vikatan’s cartoon falls under political satire, a protected form of expression in a democracy.
The government’s broad discretionary powers in blocking websites raise concerns over potential misuse.
Way Ahead:
Need for Greater Transparency
Experts suggest making blocking orders public and subject to judicial review.
Affected parties should receive formal notices to present their case before a decision is made.
Balancing National Security with Press Freedom
The government must differentiate between genuine security threats and political dissent.
A clearer framework on digital content restrictions will help avoid arbitrary censorship.
Strengthening Legal Safeguards
The Supreme Court may be called upon to define the limits of website blocking, ensuring it aligns with constitutional rights.
Reforms in IT laws could bring more accountability to the process.
Conclusion:
The Vikatan website block raises important concerns about government censorship, transparency, and press freedom.
While blocking laws exist to safeguard national security, their application to political content remains controversial.
Moving forward, greater legal clarity and accountability will be essential to protect both media independence and responsible governance.

**********Regulating Digital Content - Need for a New Legal Framework
Why in News?
The Indian government is examining the need for a new legal framework to regulate digital platforms amid
concerns over violent and obscene content.
The move comes in the wake of the
Ranveer Allahbadia controversy
and broader societal concerns regarding the
misuse of the right to freedom of expression.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Concerns Over Digital Content Regulation
Existing Legal Framework
Government's Response to Concerns Over Digital Content Regulation
Challenges in Regulation
The Role of YouTube and Social Media Intermediaries
Conclusion
Concerns Over Digital Content Regulation:
The Union Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry
stated that the Supreme Court, multiple High Courts (HCs), MPs, and statutory bodies like the National Commission for Women have raised concerns regarding harmful content.
For example,
the SC granted Ranveer Allahbadia protection from arrest but strongly criticized his comments.
The ministry acknowledges
increasing public demand for stricter laws
against harmful content on digital platforms, and is
currently assessing
the need for amendments or a new legal framework.
Existing Legal Framework:
The I&B Ministry has been
reviewing statutory provisions
and considering the need for a new regulatory framework.
Existing regulations include:
The Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code (IT Rules, 2021):
Mandate self-regulation and content classification.
Indecent Representation of Women Act, 1986:
Prohibits obscene depiction of women.
Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023:
Contains provisions against obscene content.
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act:
Protects children from exposure to harmful content.
Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000:
Addresses publication of obscene or pornographic material.
Recent government directives include:
The I&B Ministry has asked social media channels and OTT platforms -
To follow the
Code of Ethics
prescribed in the IT Rules 2021, and
Implement “
access control for A-rated content
” to prevent children from consuming inappropriate material.
The OTT platforms
must not transmit any prohibited content
and undertake age-based classification of content.
Government's Response to Concerns Over Digital Content Regulation:
The Standing Committee
on Communications and Information Technology has sought clarification on necessary amendments to existing laws.
The Ministry of Electronics and IT has been asked to
assess the efficacy of existing laws
and propose amendments to the
IT Act, 2000.
Challenges in Regulation:
OTT platforms and social media currently lack a clear regulatory framework.
The IT Rules, 2021
, require
a three-tier grievance redressal mechanism
Level 1:
Self-regulation by the platform.
Level 2:
Industry-wide self-regulation.
Level 3:
Government oversight.
This mechanism has been challenged in various HCs, with the Bombay and Madras HCs staying its enforcement.
The Kerala HC has restrained coercive action over non-compliance with (Part III of) the IT Rules 2021.
Over 15 petitions have been filed against these rules, and the SC has transferred all cases to the Delhi HC for a consolidated hearing.
The Role of YouTube and Social Media Intermediaries:
is regulated under the IT Rules but is not liable for user-generated content unless it violates government directives.
Unlike traditional publishers, YouTube functions as a social media intermediary and has
limited accountability
for content uploaded by individual users.
New media services like OTT platforms and YouTube currently
operate without a specific regulatory framework
, increasing demands for legal amendments.
Conclusion:
The debate over digital content regulation highlights the
tension between freedom of expression and the need for responsible content dissemination
While there have been concerns regarding
content censoring for extraneous reasons
, the government is actively reviewing laws to create a
more structured and enforceable legal framework
for digital platforms.
Judicial scrutiny and public discourse
will play a key role in shaping the future of digital content regulation in India.

**********Controversy around three-language policy
Why in news?
The Union Government has withheld ₹2,152 crore in
Samagra Shiksha
funds from Tamil Nadu for refusing to join the PM SHRI scheme due to its opposition to implementing the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.
While the State is willing to participate in
, it rejects the NEP’s three-language formula, preferring its longstanding two-language policy.
Centre insists on compliance, citing constitutional alignment, but Tamil Nadu government refuses to yield, calling it “blackmail” and questioning the constitutional basis of such mandates.
What’s in today’s article?
Three-Language Formula in NEP 2020
Opposition to this policy in Tamil Nadu
Perceived Imposition of Hindi
The Way Forward
NEP 2020 retains the three-language formula, originally introduced in the 1968 NEP.
However, unlike the earlier policy, which mandated Hindi across India, NEP 2020 provides more flexibility without imposing any specific language on States.
Language Flexibility and Choice
The policy allows States, regions, and students to choose the three languages, ensuring that at least two are native to India.
This means non-Hindi-speaking States are not necessarily required to adopt Hindi.
Emphasis on Bilingual Education
NEP 2020 promotes bilingual teaching, encouraging instruction in the home language/mother tongue along with English.
Role of Sanskrit
The policy highlights Sanskrit as an optional language within the three-language framework, giving it special emphasis.
Tamil Nadu has a long history of resisting the imposition of Hindi.
In 1937, the Justice Party opposed the Rajaji-led Madras government’s attempt to make Hindi compulsory in schools.
Protests led to the deaths of two activists, Thalamuthu and Natarajan, and the policy was eventually withdrawn.
1965 Anti-Hindi Agitation
In 1965, violent protests erupted in Tamil Nadu against making Hindi the sole official language, resulting in at least 70 deaths.
The unrest resurfaced in 1968 when the Parliament mandated Hindi teaching under the three-language formula.
Dravidian Movement’s Stand
In 1968, the DMK government under C.N. Annadurai passed a resolution rejecting the three-language formula, reinforcing Tamil Nadu’s two-language policy of Tamil and English.
Since then, successive governments have opposed any changes to this policy.
Recent Opposition and Policy Adjustments
In 2019, strong resistance from Tamil Nadu led to the removal of mandatory Hindi learning from the draft NEP proposed by the Kasturirangan Committee.
The State continues to uphold its two-language system, resisting any attempts to introduce Hindi in schools.
Political parties and activists in Tamil Nadu see the three-language policy as a covert attempt to impose Hindi.
They argue that practical constraints, such as the lack of resources for additional language teachers, would naturally lead to Hindi being the default third language.
Government Actions Fueling Suspicion
The Union Government’s promotion of Hindi, including a ₹50 crore allocation in 2019 for appointing Hindi teachers in non-Hindi-speaking States, has reinforced concerns.
Critics point out the lack of similar efforts to promote south Indian languages in northern schools or Kendriya Vidyalayas.
A constructive dialogue and a practical compromise between the Centre and Tamil Nadu are essential.
Education, moved to the concurrent list during the Emergency, requires cooperative policymaking.
Tamil Nadu’s two-language policy has yielded strong outcomes in enrolment and dropout rates.
Disagreements over the three-language policy should not obstruct crucial funding for Samagra Shiksha.

**********Rising servicification of manufacturing makes wage growth comparisons tough
Why in news?
The Economic Survey 2024-25 highlighted that while corporate profits have surged in recent years, wage growth has lagged. However, the president of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) argued that businesses are regularly increasing salaries.
He suggested that recent wage trends may not be directly comparable to the past due to the growing
, where firms increasingly integrate services with traditional manufacturing, altering employment structures and wage patterns.
What’s in today’s article?
Servicification of manufacturing
Economic Survey Flags Wage Growth Concerns
Industry Perspective on Wage Trends
Call for Balanced Growth
Servification of manufacturing refers to the increasing integration of services with traditional manufacturing processes.
It involves manufacturers offering value-added services such as maintenance, consulting, customization, and digital solutions alongside physical products.
This shift is driven by changing consumer preferences, technological advancements, and competitive pressures.
Levels where servification takes place
Production Stage
– Incorporating automation, AI, and data analytics to enhance efficiency.
Product Enhancement
– Bundling services like installation, maintenance, and software updates with products.
Business Model Transformation
– Moving from selling products to offering solutions (e.g., subscription-based models, leasing instead of selling machinery).
Benefits of Servification:
Increased Revenue
– Generates new income streams beyond product sales.
Customer Retention
– Enhances customer engagement and loyalty through ongoing services.
Differentiation
– Provides a competitive edge in markets dominated by commoditized products.
Sustainability
– Encourages circular economy practices like remanufacturing and extended product lifecycles.
Challenges of Servification
High Initial Investment
– Requires technological and skill upgradation.
Complexity in Execution
– Managing both manufacturing and service aspects can be challenging.
Workforce Transformation
– Employees need new skills, such as data analysis and customer service.
Market Adaptation
– Customers may be resistant to paying for added services initially.
The Economic Survey 2024-25 highlighted that while corporate profits have surged, wage growth has slowed, potentially dampening demand and economic growth.
It noted that revenue for 4,000 listed firms grew by 6% in 2023-24, while corporate profits rose by 22.3%, but employment expanded by just 1.5%.
Wage growth for employees and contract workers has not kept pace with inflation, raising concerns about weakening consumer demand.
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) president countered that businesses are regularly revising wages based on inflation and industry benchmarks to retain talent.
However, he argued that
wage comparisons with the past may be misleading due to the increasing servicification of manufacturing
, where firms outsource various functions to specialized service providers instead of employing in-house staff.
Impact of Servicification on Employment
Manufacturing firms now rely more on external agencies for non-core functions like utility management and logistics.
This shift leads to
structural changes in employment patterns, as many workers are now employed by service providers rather than manufacturers directly, making traditional wage comparisons less relevant
There is an urgent need to balance profitability with wage growth, cautioning that without
higher wages
, consumer demand may weaken, affecting long-term growth.
The Economic Survey echoed this, stressing that
sustained economic expansion requires stronger employment incomes
, which fuel consumption and investment.
