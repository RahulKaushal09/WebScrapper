Highest-ever organ transplants in India
Why in news?
According to the annual report of the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), in 2023, India achieved a record 18,378 organ transplants, with 10% going to foreign nationals.
As per this report, 2023 saw highest-ever organ transplants in India. With this, India ranked third in the world in organ transplant and second in corneal transplant in 2023.

Regulatory frameworks guiding the organ transplantation in India
Key highlights of the report
NOTTO is a national level organization set up under Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
It functions as apex centre for all India activities of coordination and networking for:
procurement and distribution of organs and tissues; and
registry of Organs and Tissues Donation and Transplantation in country.
Legislation
In 1994, The
Transplantation of Human Organs Act (THOA)
was promulgated by the government of India.
Transplantation of Human Organs Rules
followed in 1995 and were last amended in 2014, increasing the scope of donation and including tissues for transplantation.
The act made
commercialization of organs a punishable offence
and legalized the concept of brain death in India allowing deceased donation by obtaining organs from brain stem dead person.
Institution
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization
(NOTTO) is a national level organization set up under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
Besides laying down policy guidelines and protocols for various functions, it coordinates all the activities associated with organ donation at national level.
Organ transplant rules
In February 2023 the govt modified national organ transplantation guidelines.
The new guidelines have done away with the 65-year age limit for registration of patients seeking organs from a deceased donor.
There was no age cap for living donor transplants
, where family members donate organs like kidneys and livers.
However, people over the age of 65 years couldn’t register to receive organs from deceased donors as per guidelines of NOTTO.
It has asked states to
remove the domicile criterion for registering those seeking organs from deceased donor for transplant procedures
Now the needy person can go to any state of the country and register for getting organ and also get the transplant done.
The patient will be allotted a unique ID by NOTTO on registering.
This will get carried forward even if the patient changes multiple hospitals in different States.
Noting that some states have been charging fees ranging between Rs 5,000 to 10,000 for registering such patients, this guideline has asked them not to charge money.
Steps are being taken to develop a uniform organ transport policy for the country
To develop a uniform organ transport policy for the country, consultations were held with seven ministries coordinated by NITI Aayog.
Standard Operative Procedures have been drafted, which prescribe that:
every concerned ministry will have a nodal officer and
State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) will coordinate with a nodal officer to facilitate organ transport.
Key Highlights of the report
Status of organ transplants recorded in a year
Organ transplants recorded in a year have
more than tripled
in the last decade, with kidney transplants accounting for a majority of them.
In 2023,
a total of 18,378 transplants were carried out in India
, which ranks third in the world in organ transplant and second in corneal transplant.
The total number of transplants comprising, both transplants from living donors and those from deceased donors, in the country was recorded at 4,990 in 2013.
Milestones achieved in deceased organ donations
India achieved another milestone in 2023 --
more than 1,000 deceased organ donations in a year for the first time
, breaching its record from last year.
The number of deceased-donor transplants has increased from 837 in 2013 to 2,935 in 2023.
Trend in organ donation based on gender
Among living donors, the number of females (9,784) was almost double the number of males (5,651) in 2023.
However, among deceased donors, males outnumbered females at 844 compared to 255.
Among the recipients, 30% were women.
Organ transplants to foreign nationals in India
There were 1,851 organ transplants to foreign nationals in the country and Delhi-NCR accounted for nearly 78% of these.
Foreigners are allocated organs from deceased donors only when there are no Indian patients at the state, regional, or national level who matches
There were allegations of irregularities in approval for transplants in foreign nationals reported from Delhi and Rajasthan.
There were allegations of Myanmar nationals “purchasing” kidneys from poor people in their country and getting the surgeries done at Delhi hospital.
Organ donation rate
The organ donation rate in our country
still continues to be less than 1 per million population
There is need to encourage organ donation from deceased individuals to meet the growing demand for organs.
This is important because more people are suffering from severe organ failure due to the rise in non-communicable and lifestyle diseases.

**********Village Defence Guards provided with sophisticated weapons
Why in news?
Recently, Union Minister Jitendra Singh announced that Village Defence Guards (VDGs) in the Jammu region have been equipped with sophisticated weapons to address rising terror incidents.
Representing the Udhampur constituency, which has seen increased terror activities since 2021, he was speaking at the “Empowering Youth for Viksit Bharat” program in Kathua district.
He emphasized breaking the nexus between terrorists and drug dealers and noted that defense forces and law enforcement agencies have updated their strategies to combat terrorism more effectively.
What’s in today’s article?
Militancy on the rise in Jammu
New pattern emerging
Districts such as Doda, Kishtwar, Ramban, Kathua, Udhampur, Reasi, Rajouri, and Poonch have seen a resurgence in militant activity.
While the Kashmir Valley has historically experienced frequent terror incidents,
the Jammu belt has been relatively peaceful for the past two decades
This revival of militancy in an area that was a hotbed in the late 1990s and early 2000s has alarmed the security establishment.
Statistics
Since 2021, the Jammu region has experienced 31 terror incidents, resulting in the deaths of 47 security forces and 19 civilians, along with 48 terrorists killed.
In contrast, the Kashmir Valley has reported 263 terror incidents, with 68 security forces and 75 civilians killed, and 417 terrorists neutralized.
While the number of incidents in Jammu is significantly lower than in the Valley, the increased frequency and targeted nature of attacks on pilgrims and security forces in Jammu are particularly concerning
Background
The militancy that began in Kashmir in the early 1990s had spread to the adjoining Doda district by mid 1990s.
The demand for arming the civilian population first rose after the massacre of 13 people in Kishtwar in 1993.
As the killings increased, prompting the migration of Hindus from villages to nearby towns, the Home Ministry in 1995 decided to set up the VDCs.
About
VDGs, formerly known as Village Defence Committees (VDCs), are community-based security groups established in the Jammu and Kashmir region.
Initiated in 1995, the program was aimed at providing local defense against terrorist activities, especially targeting vulnerable communities.
Purpose
The primary purpose of VDGs is to enhance local security by providing immediate defense against terrorist threats.
They play a crucial role in supporting formal law enforcement agencies, gathering intelligence, and maintaining peace in their respective areas.
Composition
Law enforcement agencies will form groups of armed civilians from the "more vulnerable areas."
Each group will have no more than 15 members and will be designated as Village Defence Guards (VDGs).
Members are typically volunteers from the community, including ex-servicemen, able-bodied youth, and other civilians who undergo basic training in self-defense and weapon handling.
Control
The VDGs will function under the direction of the SP/SSP of the district concerned.
Key Functions
Surveillance and Patrolling
: VDGs conduct regular patrols and monitor suspicious activities, acting as the first line of defense against terrorist infiltrations.
Intelligence Gathering
: They collect and share vital information with security forces, aiding in preemptive actions against potential threats.
Community Mobilization
: By involving local residents, VDGs foster a sense of responsibility and vigilance within the community.
Contribution of VDCs in the past
During the peak of militancy in most parts of Jammu division, the VDCs played a significant role in combating militancy.
They were the most-feared armed groups among militants in areas where poor road networks delayed the arrival of security forces.
The villagers, well-versed with the local topography, averted many militant attacks and helped in their capture and killings.
Challenges
Resource Constraints
: VDGs often face limitations in terms of financial and logistical support, affecting their operational efficiency.
Security Risks
: Members of VDGs are at a high risk of being targeted by terrorists due to their active role in local defense.
Accountability Issues
: There have been past allegations of misuse of power by VDG members, including crimes such as abduction and rape, which led to a temporary discontinuation of the program.
Current status
The VDGs are being revived and strengthened since 2022 in response to the rising incidents of terror in the Jammu region.
Recent initiatives have included the provision of sophisticated weapons and enhanced training to better equip these groups to handle the evolving security challenges.

**********How to Reduce Landslide Risks
Why in News?
Massive landslides hit the district of Wayanad in northern Kerala, triggering large-scale death (toll stands at 215) and destruction and the number of missing people indicate that the real toll will be higher.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Possible Causes of Landslide in Wayanad
Landslides Prevention Techniques/ Measures
Possible Causes of Landslide in Wayanad:
Natural:
According to the Geological Survey of India (GSI), almost half of Kerala’s land area is prone to landslides.
The heavy rainfall in the region and the slope of the Western Ghats
mean that 31.54% of the Wayanad district is highly susceptible to landslides.
Anthropogenic:
Increasing construction activities:
The Wayanad region has become a
tourist hotspot
, with homestays and monsoon tourism being the latest trends.
The construction of resorts, artificial lakes and quarrying activities
in the eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) have exacerbated the danger of a landslide.
Changes in crop patterns:
Land use changes have occurred starting with the
British-era tea plantations
In Wayanad, there has been a 62% reduction in forest cover between 1950 and 2018, coupled with a 1,800% increase in the area under plantation.
Such
monocropping
leads to a
loosening of the topsoil
that was once held in place by the roots of a forest.
Climate change:
Climate change has played an indirect role,
leading to changes in rainfall patterns in the State
The warming of the Arabian Sea
is allowing the formation of deep cloud systems, leading to extremely heavy rainfall over a shorter period. Heavy rainfalls cause run-offs that can lead to landslides.
Issues with landslide warnings:
The IMD
issues warnings for heavy rainfall (in a colour-coded system) and the week before the landslides, the alert was largely yellow, which does not call for action.
The GSI
has been designated the nodal agency for landslide studies, and has been given the responsibility of evolving an early warning system and protocols for landslide risk reduction.
However,
this is still in the experimental stage
and will take four or five more years to be ready for public use, a senior GSI official said.
Landslides Prevention Techniques/ Measures:
Banning/ regulating construction activities in ESZ:
For example, the Gadgil panel report of 2011 recommended that the entire region of the Western Ghats, spanning 1,29,000 square km across six States, be declared an ESZ.
Upgrading institutional capacities and coordination:
For example, IMD must use new technologies for accurate weather predictions.
Engineering solutions:
Slope stabilisation:
It involves adding structural elements to the slope to increase its stability.
Grading and terracing:
It involves modifying the slope’s shape and gradient to reduce the risk of landslides.
Soil reinforcement:
It involves adding materials to the slope to increase its strength and stability.
Natural solutions:
Vegetation control:
Planting trees, shrubs, or grasses can help stabilise the soil, absorb excess water, and reduce erosion.
Mulching:
Mulch is a layer of organic or inorganic material applied to the soil surface. It helps retain moisture, prevent erosion, and stabilise the slope.
Bioengineering techniques:
They combine the use of plants and engineering principles to stabilise slopes.
Water management:
It slows down the flow of water, allowing it to infiltrate the soil gradually.
Early warning systems and monitoring for landslides:
They provide timely information and alerts, allowing individuals and communities to take necessary actions to mitigate the impacts of landslides.
Emergency preparedness for landslides:
Despite preventive measures, landslides can still occur. Being prepared and knowing how to respond during a landslide event is crucial for minimising the risks.
