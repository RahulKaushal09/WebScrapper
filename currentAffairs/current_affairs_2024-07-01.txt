Should education be brought back to the State list
Why in news?
The NEET-UG exam faced controversies with issues like grace marks, allegations of paper leaks, and other irregularities. The UGC-NET exam was cancelled after being conducted, and the CSIR-NET and NEET-PG exams have been postponed.
Against this backdrop, there has been ongoing debate about transferring education back to the state list.
What’s in today’s article?
Status of Education– Historical Background
International practices
Way forward
Early phase - Education in Provincial list
The Government of India Act, 1935 during the British rule created a federal structure for the first time in our polity.
The legislative subjects were distributed between the federal legislature (present day Union) and provinces (present day States).
Education, as an important public good, was kept under the provincial list.
After Independence
After independence, the trend set by the GoI Act 1935 was continued and
education was part of the ‘State list’ under the distribution of powers
Recommendation of Swaran Singh Committee
During the Emergency, the Congress party constituted the Swaran Singh Committee to provide recommendations for amendments to the Constitution.
One of the recommendations of this
committee was to place ‘education’ in the concurrent list in order to evolve all-India policies on the subject
42nd constitutional amendment and status of education
The 42nd constitutional amendment (1976) by shifting ‘education’ from the State list to the concurrent list.
No detailed rationale was provided for this change.
Attempt to bring back education in State list
The Janata Party government led by Morarji Desai passed the 44th constitutional amendment (1978) to reverse many of the controversial changes made through the 42nd amendment.
One of these amendments that was passed in the Lok Sabha
but not in the Rajya Sabha was to bring back ‘education’ to the State list
Since then, education remains in concurrent list of the Constitution.
Prevailing international practices
In the
United States
, educational standards and standardized tests are set by state and local governments, while federal oversight focuses on financial aid and key educational policies.
Canada
delegates education entirely to its provinces.
In Germany
, educational legislative authority resides with its states (Länder).
South Africa
has national departments for school and higher education, with provinces implementing national policies and addressing local educational needs.
Arguments for 'Education' in Concurrent List
Uniform Education Policy
- Advocates argue for a unified approach to education across the country to improve standards and ensure consistency.
Synergy Between Centre and States
- Central coordination is seen as beneficial for aligning national goals with state-level implementation.
Corruption and Lack of Professionalism
- Critics cite concerns about inefficiencies and ethical issues within state-level management of education.
Arguments for Restoring 'Education' to State List
Recent Issues with Centralisation
- Events like NEET controversies highlight that centralized control does not eliminate problems, challenging assumptions about governance efficacy.
Autonomy and Tailored Policies
- States argue for autonomy to tailor educational policies to local needs, especially concerning syllabus, testing, and admissions for professional courses.
One size fits all approach can not work
- Considering the vast diversity of the country, a ‘one size fits all’ approach is neither feasible nor desirable.
Financial Distribution
–A significant amount of education expenditure is borne by the states, suggesting a need for productive discussion towards moving ‘education’ back to the State list.
According to the Ministry of Education's 2022 report on education spending, out of the total ₹6.25 lakh crore spent by education departments in 2020-21, the
Centre contributed 15%, and the States contributed 85%
When including all other departments' spending on education and training, the breakdown shifts to 24% by the Centre and 76% by the States.
Hybrid Model
- Experts suggest maintaining central oversight for regulatory frameworks like medical and technical education while devolving policymaking autonomy to states.
Collaborative Governance
- Emphasis must be given on productive dialogue between central and state authorities to achieve balanced educational reforms and efficient resource allocation.

**********Next phase of conservation plan for Great Indian Bustard
Why in news?
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has approved Rs 56 crore for the next phase of the conservation of Great Indian Bustard (GIB) and Lesser Florican.
What’s in today’s article?
About
GIBs are the largest among the four-bustard species found in India.
The other three being
MacQueen’s bustard
lesser florican
and the
Bengal florican
Being terrestrial birds, they spend most of their time on the ground with occasional flights to go from one part of their habitat to the other.
They feed on insects, lizards, grass seeds etc. GIBs are considered the
flagship bird species of grassland and hence barometers of the health of grassland ecosystems
Habitat and Status
This bird,
found mainly in Rajasthan and Gujarat
, has been categorized as
critically endangered
by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
As per the 2021 report of the IUCN, they are on the verge of extinction with hardly 50 to 249 of them alive.
GIBs’ historic range included much of the Indian sub-continent but it has now shrunken to just 10 per cent of it.
Among the heaviest birds with flight
GIBs prefer grasslands as their habitats
Threats
Scientists of Wildlife Institute of India (WII) have been pointing out overhead power transmission lines as the biggest threat to the GIBs.
WII research has concluded that in Rajasthan, 18 GIBs die every year after colliding with overhead powerlines.
These birds, due to their poor frontal vision, can’t detect powerlines in time and their weight make in-flight quick manoeuvres difficult.
Kutch and Thar desert are the places which have witnessed creation of huge renewable energy infrastructure over the past two decades.
This led to installation of windmills and construction of power lines even in core GIB areas.
Conservation measures
In 2015, the Central government launched the
GIB species recovery programme
Under the programme, the WII and Rajasthan Forest department have jointly set up
conservation breeding centres
where GIB eggs harvested from the wild are incubated artificially and hatchlings raised in controlled environment.
The plan is to create a population which can act as insurance against the threat of extinction and release the third generation of these captive-bred birds into the wild.
Bird diverters
have also been installed on power lines to protect the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) from collisions.
The diverters act as reflectors that birds can see from about 50 meters away.
When birds spot the diverters, they change their flight path to avoid colliding with the power lines.
Lesser florican is the smallest bird of the bustard family (Otididae).
It is endemic to India and is one of the four bustard species of India.
Locally, the bird is known as Kharmor (grass peacock) in Gujarat and Khar titar (grass pheasant) in Rajasthan.
Though it prefers open, grassy landscapes, the lesser florican is generally seen resting within thick bushes during the day.
In non-breeding months, it can inhabit wooded lands and scrublands, along with grasslands.
Being omnivorous, their diet ranges from small insects and critters to herbs and shoots.
It inhabits the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
IUCN Status
The bird is currently listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.
Overview
Funding Approval
- The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has allocated Rs 56 crore for the next phase of the conservation of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) and Lesser Florican.
Conservation Goals
- The plan includes habitat development, in-situ conservation, completion of conservation breeding centers, and releasing captive-bred birds.
Proposal Recommendation
- The National CAMPA executive committee recommended the Wildlife Institute of India’s (WII) proposal for scaling up the project for 2024-2033.
Project Components
First Component
Conservation Breeding Centers
: Completion of the CBC in Jaisalmer’s Ramdevra and development of the Sorsan Lesser Florican facility.
Captive-bred Birds
: Preparatory work for releasing captive-bred birds and post-release monitoring.
Artificial Insemination
: Development and implementation as a backup for captive breeding.
Second Component
In-situ Conservation
- Efforts in other range states including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.
Timeline and Activities
Population Estimation
- Between 2024-2026, WII will estimate GIB populations in Jaisalmer and range states, and conduct rangewide population estimation of the Lesser Florican.
Egg Collection
- Annually collect two to four GIB eggs and six to ten Lesser Florican eggs.
Rewilding
- Set to begin in 2027, identifying and developing release sites, and creating soft release enclosures.
Background
The conservation programme has been running since 2016 for long-term recovery of critically endangered GIB and Lesser Florican.
As of now, around 140 GIBs and fewer than 1,000 Lesser Floricans are surviving in the wild.
Severe decline due to hunting, habitat loss, depredation of eggs, and overhead power lines.
Current Conservation Facilities
GIB Breeding Centers: Located in Rajasthan’s Sam and Ramdevra with 40 GIBs.
Lesser Florican Center: Located in Sorsan with seven individuals.
Legal Oversight
Supreme Court Involvement –
The SC is also monitoring the GIB and Lesser Florican conservation programme.
A petition seeking protection of the two species is pending before it.
Power Line Issue –
SC initially ordered burying power lines in GIB habitats but recalled the order in 2024 due to practicality concerns.
An expert committee is studying the issue.

**********Implementation of the New Criminal Law Regime
Why in News?
Three new criminal laws - Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA) - came into effect across the country on July 1.
They brought widespread changes in India's criminal justice system and ended colonial-era laws - the Indian Penal Code (1860), Code of Criminal Procedure (1973) and the Indian Evidence Act (1872).
Together, these three laws govern the criminal justice jurisprudence - from defining penal offences, prescribing processes for investigation and evidence gathering to governing the process of a trial in court.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Breaking Down the Three New Criminal Laws
Upsides and Downsides of the Three New Criminal Laws
Analysing the Government’s Preparation for Implementing the 3 Criminal Laws
Breaking Down the Three New Criminal Laws:
The BNS introduces some new crimes
: For example,
Clause 69:
It penalises sexual intercourse through the employment of “deceitful means” and mentions upto 10 years imprisonment and a fine for the offence.
Deceitful means include the false promise of employment or promotion, inducement, or marrying after suppressing identity.
Critics say that this might end up criminalising consensual relationships and provide a fillip to the “love jihad” narrative in some cases.
Clause 103:
It (for the first time) recognises murder on the ground of race, caste, or community as a separate offence.
In 2018, the SC had directed the Centre to consider a separate law for lynching and the new provision gives legal recognition to such crimes.
Inclusion of offences such as organised crime and terror:
Clause 111(1) of the BNS borrows heavily from the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).
Organised crime
encompasses any continuing unlawful activity including kidnapping, robbery, vehicle theft, extortion, land grabbing, contract killing, economic offences, cyber-crimes, etc.
Clause 304(1):
It defines snatching as a new crime, distinct from theft.
Community service as an alternate form of punishment for some offences
These include small theft, defamation, and attempt to die by suicide with an intention to keep a public official from discharging her duty.
However, the BNS does not define what constitutes community service, leaving it to the discretion of judges.
BNSS:
The expansion of detention in police custody:
From the 15-day limit in the CrPC to up to 90 days.
Victim-centric approach:
The BNSS states that in cases where the punishment is seven years or more, the victim shall be given an opportunity of being heard before withdrawal of the case by the government.
Trials in absentia:
Where a person accused of a crime can be tried and convicted in his absence. Critics argue that the introduction of trials in absentia under normal criminal law allows the state to forgo its duty to properly locate the accused before the trial begins.
Removes the provision for statutory bail
: If an accused has more than one offence against his name.
BSA:
Modified the definition of document:
By including electronic and digital records and recognising digital and electronic records as primary evidence.
Now, the digital or electronic records will have the same legal effect, validity, and enforceability as other documents.
Expanded the scope of secondary evidence:
It included additional categories such as oral admissions, written submissions, etc.
Modified the need for confessional admission
: A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding.
Upsides and Downsides of the Three New Criminal Laws:
Upsides:
Sexual intercourse with a minor wife
has been brought under the ambit of rape.
The inclusion of offences for mob-lynching
is crucial, and signals a legislative acknowledgement of such hate crimes.
In a progressive step, the BNS entirely leaves out the contentious
Section 377
of the IPC which criminalises “carnal intercourse against the order of nature”.
The emphasis on video-conferencing of trials
, and prescription of timelines for speedy trials should improve justice delivery but their success will depend on implementation on the ground.
Grey areas:
The consultation process (during pandemic) and the
hasty passage of the laws
through Parliament has caused much disquiet.
According to some legal experts, although the new laws make significant changes,
they do not ‘overhaul’ the existing laws.
Despite the government’s claims (of doing away with sedition),
the BNS has in fact introduced the offence with a wider definition.
With rape laws still not made gender-neutral
, there is little criminal recourse for male victims of sexual assault.
Analysing the Government’s Preparation for Implementing the 3 Criminal Laws:
Operational training: For example,
the Bar Council of India has mandated that the new laws be incorporated into curricula of universities and Centres of Legal Education from the 2024-25 academic year.
Publicity/awareness campaign:
The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) is coordinating efforts of the Inter-Ministerial Group for a coordinated publicity campaign.
Tech upgradation:
NCRB has made 23 functional modifications in the
Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS)
application to facilitate tech compatibility, including on registration of FIRs.
NIC has developed applications such as
eSakshya, Nyay Shruti, and eSummon
to facilitate videography/photography of crime scenes, judicial hearings, and delivery of court summons electronically.
Capacity building:
The BPR&D has developed 13 training modules to build capacity of the police, prisons, prosecutors, judicial officers, forensic experts, and central police organisations.

**********NCERT’s New Report Card to Track Post School Plans, Life Skills
Why in the News?
PARAKH, a standard-setting body under the NCERT, recently released a ‘Holistic Progress Card’ for secondary school students (Classes 9 to 12).
What’s in Today’s Article?
About PARAKH (Objective, Focus Areas, etc.)
About HPC (Objective, Features, Benefits, etc.)
News Summary
About PARAKH:
National Assessment Centre- PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development) was set up in NCERT as an independent body in 2023.
: To fulfil the basic objectives of setting norms, standards, guidelines and implement activities related to student assessment along with other tasks as mandated by the
National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
There are four major areas of focus for PARAKH:
Capacity Development in Competency-Based Assessment: Project Vidyasagar –
, in partnership with the PhD Chamber of Commerce, is organizing workshops across India to familiarize educators with the new pedagogical and policy changes in the National Curriculum Framework 2023.
The goal is to bridge gaps in implementing competency-based learning and teaching.
Large-Scale Achievement Survey:
PARAKH conducted the State Educational Achievement Survey in November 2023, assessing students in Grades 3, 6, and 9 across 30 States/UTs.
The survey aims to monitor and assess educational competencies in foundational literacy, numeracy, language, and mathematics.
Equivalence of School Boards:
PARAKH is working to standardize examination reforms across all Indian school boards.
Regional workshops were held to collect data on administration, curriculum, assessments, and infrastructure.
A report was prepared, and national workshops were conducted to discuss and draft policy recommendations for equivalence. T
The goal is to allocate credit points to academic, vocational, and experiential learning.
Holistic Progress Cards
About Holistic Progress Cards:
The Holistic Progress Card, or HPC, will no longer depend on marks or grades to evaluate a student’s academic performance. Instead, it will rely on a 360-degree evaluation.
Under the HPC model, the
students will be regularly assessed through class activities where they are not just passive learners but active agents
The activities will prompt students to apply diverse skills and competencies that will demonstrate whether they have been able to grasp concepts.
The difficulty level they experience while performing a task will also be assessed.
Teachers will be able to register the strengths of a student, such as their ability to “collaborate”, “follow instructions”, show “creativity” or “empathy”, etc.
Similarly, weaknesses like “lack of attention”, “peer pressure”, “lack of preparation” will help teachers identify areas where students need help.
The HPC allows students to evaluate their own and their classmates’ performance with simple responses like ‘Yes’, ‘No’, or ‘Do not know’ to descriptive statements.
Additionally, it connects home and school by incorporating parents’ input on their child’s homework abilities, classroom engagement, and balancing screen time with extracurricular activities.
This approach makes parents an integral part of the child’s learning process.
Benefits of HPC:
The HPC goes beyond numerical grades, focusing on descriptive and analytical evaluations that encompass academic achievements as well as the development of critical skills in a child.
It promotes a shift from summative to formative assessment, fostering competency-based evaluation and holistic growth.
Additionally, it seeks to provide teachers and parents with insights to support each student in learning.
NCERT’s New Report Card to Track Post School Plans, Life Skills:
PARAKH has recently released a ‘Holistic Progress Card’ for secondary school students (Classes 9 to 12).
As per the available information, the report card will not be used in the ongoing 2024-25 academic session. However, teachers and other officials will be trained on its implementation.
States can take a call on whether to implement the HPC as released by the NCERT or adapt it to suit their needs.
These report cards are expected to be factored in the results for those appearing for the Board exams in Classes 10 and 12.
Some states, including
Jammu and Kashmir
Madhya Pradesh
Gujarat
Maharashtra
Haryana
Himachal Pradesh
, have begun preparing to implement the HPCs for those up to class 8 from the 2024-25 academic session onwards.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Funds released by the Centre for restoration work after natural disasters in the State
Why in the news?
At a June 22 meeting for Union Budget 2024-25, Tamil Nadu’s Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu requested ₹63,246 crore for Chennai Metro Rail Phase-2, ₹3,000 crore for disaster restoration, and increased unit costs for centrally sponsored schemes.
How are the funds for phase two of the Chennai Metro Rail distributed?
Funding Agencies and International Support:
Chennai Metro Rail Phase-2 is financed by multiple international agencies, including the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and New Development Bank (NDB).
State Government Contributions:
Up to March 31, 2024, the Tamil Nadu government sanctioned ₹5,400 crore as share capital for the Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) and ₹12,013.89 crore as subordinate debt, bearing the entire expenditure due to delays in approval from the Union Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
Is the Centre stalling the funds for the metro project?
Approval Status:
Public Investment Board:
The Chennai Metro Rail Project’s Phase-2 was approved by the Public Investment Board (PIB) as a Central sector project under the equity sharing model in August 2021.
Union Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs:
The project has been awaiting approval from the Union Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) since then.
State Government Actions:
Foundation Stone:
Despite the pending approval, the foundation stone for the phase was laid by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in November 2020 when the AIADMK was in power.
Ongoing Expenditure:
The Tamil Nadu government continues to fund the project independently, stressing its finances and urging the Centre to sanction the project under the 50:50 equity sharing model as was done for Phase 1.
What about funds released by the Centre for restoration work after natural disasters in the State?
Initial Request by Tamil Nadu:
Tamil Nadu submitted detailed memoranda to the Union government, seeking approximately ₹37,906 crore for restoration works following two natural disaster spells in 2023.
Initial Central Release:
The Union government initially released a sum of ₹276 crore for immediate restoration efforts.
Additional Approvals:
The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) later approved additional assistance of ₹285.54 crore and ₹397.13 crore for the two disaster spells.
Disbursed Amounts:
From these approvals, a total of ₹115.49 crore and ₹160.61 crore were disbursed under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).
State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF):
The Union government’s order also mentioned ₹406.57 crore as the 50% available in the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) account of Tamil Nadu as of April 1, 2023.
Way forward:
Metro Rail Project:
The Union government should prioritize and expedite the approval process for significant infrastructure projects like the Chennai Metro Rail Phase-2. This can be achieved by setting stricter timelines for the Union Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) to finalize decisions.
Natural Disaster Restoration:
The Centre should reassess the current disaster relief funding mechanism to ensure timely and adequate financial support for states hit by natural disasters.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the recent measures initiated in disaster management by the Government of India departing from the earlier reactive approach.

Functions of IMF and Recent Challenges Faced by Developing Countries
Why in the news?
Once again, mass protests in Kenya, where at least 30 people were fatally shot by police, highlight opposition to an IMF-supported finance Bill proposing essential goods tax hikes.
Bretton Woods Conference of 1944
The Bretton Woods Conference was held in 1944 in New Hampshire, USA. It established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
The IMF was designed to aid economic development and promote monetary cooperation and stability globally.
Criticism:
It has been criticized for reflecting and perpetuating power dynamics favouring Western financial interests, with voting rights disproportionately allocated based on financial contributions rather than equal representation.
Functions:
The IMF aims to provide financial assistance and policy advice to member countries facing balance of payments problems.
Challenges:
Austerity Measures:
IMF loans often come with conditions such as austerity measures (like tax hikes and spending cuts) that can be unpopular and detrimental to social services and economic stability.
Dependency:
Many developing countries face criticism for being overly dependent on IMF loans, which come with stringent conditions that may not always align with local priorities.
Public Backlash:
There is often a public and political backlash against IMF policies perceived as imposing Western economic ideologies without adequate consideration for local contexts.
SAP (Structural Adjustment Programs) and Its Impacts
Definition:
SAPs are economic policies imposed by the IMF and World Bank on developing countries in exchange for loans.
Impacts:
Economic Restructuring:
SAPs typically involve privatization, deregulation, and liberalization policies aimed at restructuring national economies towards export-led growth.
Social Consequences:
They often lead to job losses, reduced public spending on health and education, and increased poverty and inequality.
Criticism of SAPs:
SAPs have been criticized for exacerbating social inequalities and benefiting Western financial interests over local populations.
Way forward:
Policy Transparency:
The IMF could enhance transparency in its loan conditions and negotiations, ensuring that the terms and impacts of loans are clearly communicated to the public and local stakeholders.
Local Consultation:
Before implementing major policy changes or austerity measures, the IMF could mandate extensive consultation with local governments, civil society organizations, and affected communities to ensure that proposed measures align with local economic priorities and social needs.
Mains PYQ:
The World Bank and the IMF, collectively known as the Bretton Woods Institutions, are the two inter-governmental pillars supporting the structure of the world’s economic and financial order. Superficially, the World Bank and the IMF exhibit many common characteristics, yet their role, functions and mandates are distinctly different. Elucidate

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About Zika Virus
Mains level:
India’s Lack of Significant Zika Surveillance and Other Diseases
Why in the news?
The detection of a Zika virus infection in Pune has once again raised concerns regarding India’s readiness to diagnose emerging infectious diseases.
Recent Outbreaks in Various Regions of India
Zika Virus:
Recent cases of Zika virus in Pune and previous outbreaks in Kerala and Uttar Pradesh highlight sporadic but concerning outbreaks across India.
Avian Influenza:
Ongoing outbreaks affecting poultry, with occasional human cases reported, indicating challenges in surveillance and testing.
Nipah Virus:
Multiple outbreaks in Kerala and sporadic cases in West Bengal underscore the recurrent nature of Nipah virus outbreaks in India.
Limited Diagnostic Capabilities:
India faces challenges with the absence of approved diagnostic tests for the Zika virus, relying on clinical symptoms and selective testing, which may lead to underreporting.
Surveillance Gaps
: There is a notable gap in systematic surveillance systems specifically tailored for Zika and other emerging infectious diseases, hampering early detection and containment efforts.
Infrastructure Deficiencies:
The country’s diagnostic infrastructure outside major institutes is inadequate, affecting the timely identification and response to outbreaks of diseases like Zika, Nipah, and avian influenza.
Dependency on Apex Institutes:
Diagnostic facilities are largely concentrated in apex national institutes, limiting accessibility and delaying the implementation of crucial public health measures during outbreaks.
Impacts of Unavailability of Infrastructure
Delayed Response:
Lack of accessible diagnostics delays the identification and isolation of cases, contact tracing, and implementation of containment measures during outbreaks.
Loss of Time:
Delays in releasing genomic sequences and validating diagnostic tests impede the rapid development and deployment of effective diagnostics.
Way Forward (Role of ICMR)
Enhanced Surveillance:
ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) should lead efforts to decentralize testing facilities, ensuring availability at district and sub-district levels.
Capacity Building:
Develop accessible and affordable diagnostic tests for Zika, Nipah, and avian influenza, leveraging lessons from COVID-19 testing infrastructure expansion.
Genomic Surveillance:
Establish a system for the rapid release of whole genome sequences into public repositories like GISAID to enhance understanding and response capabilities.
Collaboration:
Foster collaboration with industry and research institutions to streamline diagnostic test approvals and improve preparedness for future outbreaks.
Mains PYQ:
COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented devastation worldwide. However, technological advancements are being availed readily to win over the crisis. Give an account of how technology was sought to aid the management of the pandemic.

**********In news: Santhal Hul of 1855 
History and Art & Culture
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
The Santhal Revolt of 1855 was a revolt against imperialism
led by four brothers
, Sidho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav Murmu, along with sisters Phulo and Jhano.
June 30 marks the
169th anniversary
of the beginning of the revolt.
About Santhal Hul
The Santhal people revolted against the British East India Company and the
Zamindari system
, also known as the Santhal Rebellion or Santhal Hul.
The rebellion
began on June 30
, 1855.
Martial Law was imposed
on November 10, 1855, by the East India Company, lasting until January 3, 1856, when the rebellion was suppressed.
Who are the Santhals?
Santhals were
agricultural people
living in the
Rajmahal Hills
of Bihar.
Ol Chiki
(Ol Chemet)
is the writing script of Santhals.
The British asked them to
clear forests for agriculture
to increase revenue.
Damin-i-Koh (1832)
was created as a
designated area for Santhals
, now known as
Santhal Pargana.
Over time, the
British began exploiting
the Santhals, leading to the Santhal Rebellion.
Background to the Santhal Revolt (1855-56)
The Santhals faced oppr
ession by moneylenders, landlords, and British
colonial authorities.
The revolt began under the
leadership of brothers Sidhu and Kanhu
, who rallied the Santhal community.
Objectives
: The Santhals sought to:
Regain their land rights,
Abolish oppressive systems, and
Establish a self-governing society.
Despite their efforts, the British army eventually suppressed the Santhals in 1856.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Patent process in India, COVAXIN
Why in the News?
Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL),
maker of the indigenous coronavirus vaccine Covaxin, admitted to an
“inadvertent error”
in patent filings. The error involved failing to include scientists from the
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
as co-inventors in the patent filings.
COVAXIN Story
BBIL patented the process of making a batch of vaccines from virus strains provided by ICMR-NIV (National Institute of Virology).
ICMR-NIV’s role involved extracting viruses, identifying characteristics, conducting tests, and qualifying strains for vaccine development.
ICMR funded these clinical trials with ₹35 crore and incurred costs in developing Covaxin.
In return, ICMR was to receive 5% of the royalties BBIL earned from the sale of Covaxin.
Vaccine Patents in India
In India, patents, including those for vaccines, are governed by the
Patents Act, 1970
, and its subsequent amendments.
This act aligns with the
TRIPS Agreement
(Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) under the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Key Provisions of the Patents Act, 1970:
Patentable Inventions
An invention must be novel, involve an inventive step, and be capable of industrial application.
Section 3 of the Patents Act outlines what are not considered inventions, which includes methods of treatment, and processes for medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic, diagnostic, therapeutic, or other treatments of human beings.
India grants both process and product patents:
Product Patents
: Grant a monopoly over a specific drug.
Process Patents
: Prevent competitors from using the same sequence of steps to create a similar product.
Compulsory Licensing
Under Section 84, compulsory licenses can be issued
if the patented invention is not available to the public at a reasonably affordable price
, or if the reasonable requirements of the public are not being met.
Bolar Provision
Section 107A allows the
use of patented inventions, including vaccines, for the purpose of research and development
to obtain regulatory approval before the patent expires.
Why was the ICMR not included?
Bharat Biotech initially excluded ICMR from patent applications because they viewed the ICMR’s role primarily as providing virus strains and conducting clinical trials, rather than being directly involved in the technical processes of vaccine development.
There might have been a miscommunication or oversight regarding the understanding of intellectual property rights and inventorship between BBIL and ICMR initially.

Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Activated Carbon, Supercapacitors
Why in the News?
Researchers at Government College for Women, Thiruvananthapuram
, have developed a way to make
activated carbon
coconut husks,
which are a common leftover from farming in Kerala. This activated carbon is well-suited for
making supercapacitors.
Back2Basics: Supercapacitors
Supercapacitors, also known as ultra-capacitors or electrochemical capacitors, are energy storage devices that bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and batteries.
They store energy through the electrostatic separation of charges rather than through chemical reactions as in batteries.
This allows supercapacitors to charge and discharge much faster than batteries.
Key Characteristics:
High Power Density
: Supercapacitors can deliver and accept charge much more rapidly than batteries.
Long Cycle Life
: They can endure millions of charge-discharge cycles without significant degradation.
Wide Operating Temperature Range
: Supercapacitors perform well in a broad range of temperatures, making them suitable for various applications.
Structure and Components:
Electrodes
: Made of materials like activated carbon, carbon aerogels, or graphene, which have high surface areas.
Electrolyte
: The medium that allows ionic conductivity between the electrodes, typically a liquid or gel.
Separator
: A porous membrane that prevents electrical contact between the electrodes but allows ionic movement.
What is Activated Carbon?
Activated Carbon, also known as activated charcoal, is a
highly porous form of carbon
It is processed to have
small, low-volume pores
increased surface area
available for adsorption or chemical reactions.
It is widely used for purification, decontamination, and as a filtration medium.
High Surface Area
: Due to its extensive network of pores, activated carbon has a very high surface area, typically ranging from 500 to 1500 m²/g.
Porosity
: The structure includes micropores, mesopores, and macropores, allowing it to adsorb a variety of molecules.
How is it produced?
Activated carbon is produced from carbonaceous source materials such as coconut shells, peat, wood, coir, lignite, coal, and petroleum pitch.
The production involves two main steps:
Carbonization
: The raw material is subjected to high temperatures (600-900°C) in an inert atmosphere (usually nitrogen or argon) to remove volatile components.
Activation/Oxidation
: The carbonized material is treated with oxidizing agents (such as steam or carbon dioxide) at high temperatures (800-1000°C) to develop a porous structure.
Types:
Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC)
: Finely ground carbon particles primarily used in liquid phase applications.
Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)
: Larger particles used in both liquid and gas phase applications, such as water and air filtration.
Extruded Activated Carbon (EAC)
: Cylindrical pellets used mainly for gas phase applications due to their low pressure drop and high mechanical strength.
Impregnated Activated Carbon
: Activated carbon treated with chemicals to enhance its adsorption capacity for specific contaminants.
Applications:
Water Treatment
: Removes contaminants like chlorine, odors, and organic compounds from drinking water.
Air Purification
: Adsorbs volatile organic compounds (VOCs), odors, and airborne pollutants.
Medical Uses
: Used in poisoning cases to absorb toxins in the gastrointestinal tract.
Industrial Processes
: Utilized in the recovery of solvents, purification of gases, and in gold purification.
Food and Beverage
: Helps in decolorization and purification processes in sugar, wine, and juice production.
