NSCN (I-M) Demands Third-Party Intervention in Naga Conflict, Threatens Armed Resistance
Why in news?
The Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN I-M) has requested third-party intervention to resolve the longstanding Naga political issue with the Indian government.
Accusing the Centre of betraying the 2015 Framework Agreement, NSCN (I-M) warns it may resume armed resistance if this proposal is denied.
The group asserts that the Centre reneged on commitments to recognize a separate Naga flag and constitution, essential for honoring the Naga people’s unique history and "shared sovereignty."
What’s in today’s article?
Naga Insurgency
Naga Peace Accord
Background
:
The British annexed Assam in 1826, and in 1881, the Naga Hills too became part of British India.
The Naga National Council (NNC) was formed in April 1946 to carry out
social and political upliftment of the Nagas
After the return of the radical leader of Naga cause, Angami Zapu Phizo
from Burma in 1947, the faction of NNC demanding full impendence grew strong.
Shillong Accord and the split of NNC
The Shillong Accord was signed in 1975 by Government of India with a section of the NNC leaders.
As part of the accord, the leaders agreed to abjure violence and work towards the solution of the Naga problem within the framework of the Indian Constitution.
It was opposed by Phizo, Isak Swu and Muivah. Later, Isak Swu and Muivah formed the "
National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN)
" in January 1980.
Later, NSCN split into two factions, namely
NCSN (I-M) led by Isak & Muivah
NCSN (K) led by Khaplang
Demand for Greater Nagaland
The Nagas under NSCN (I-M) had various views for a new Nagaland.
One was an independent nation of Nagaland
comprising the present Nagaland, the Naga inhabited areas of Manipur and Myanmar
Another one was to integrate the Naga inhabited districts of Manipur with the state of Nagaland under the Indian Constitution.
Since 1997, NSCN (I-M) has been involved in negotiations with the Government of India and signed many ceasefire agreements.
(FA)
On August 3, 2015, the Centre signed a framework agreement with the NSCN (I-M) to resolve the Naga issue.
Both sides-maintained secrecy about its contents. Hence, the details of the agreements are not entirely clear. However, broad points included:
The government could go for
devolution of more powers
to Nagaland under provisions of Article 371 (A) of the Constitution of India.
army of NSCN-IM will be absorbed
in a new force to be raised on the lines of Home Guards.
It would involve more autonomy to Naga tribes living in Manipur.
The agreement, however,
does not include physical integration
of all Naga areas in terms of a boundary.
The agreement was only a framework, with many details still to be hammered out.
Issues with Framework agreement
The issue of sovereignty
The Framework agreement contains some clauses on ‘
sharing sovereign power
’ which is being interpreted differently by both sides.
The NSCN now argues that according to the agreement, its sovereignty has to be retained.
Any final agreement should be for peaceful coexistence of the two sovereign powers. This is not accepted by the Government.
Poor draft of the framework agreement
The wordings of the FA are vague, leaving for both sides to interpret the deal according to their own convenience.
E.g., FA at one point says, “
Inclusive peaceful co-existence of the two entities sharing sovereign power
”.
Issue of separate flag and constitution
NSCN(IM) contends that the idea of “sharing sovereign power” and “co-existence of the two entities” means:
Naga people will be
entitled to their own national flag and constitution
The FA was signed in 2015, when special status of Jammu and Kashmir existed.
However, the situation changed after scrapping of Article 370 and hence Centre cannot agree to such a demand.
Smaller groups such as Naga National Political Group (NNPGs) got strengthened
Another obstacle in the talks was that smaller groups such as NNPGs got strengthened during the tenure of previous interlocutor N Ravi.
He used the strategy of dividing the groups by giving more prominence to the smaller groups.
This annoyed the larger groups such as NSCN(IM) and they stayed away from the talks.
Release of the copy of the sensitive Framework Agreement
In August 2020, NSCN-IM released a copy of the sensitive Framework Agreement. This reduced the trust between the negotiating parties.
Trust deficit between the then Governor of Nagaland and NSCN
The group accused the then Nagaland Governor N Ravi, an interlocutor, of deleting a keyword.
In November 2017, Ravi signed an agreement with seven groups who had come together under the banner of the NNPGs.
This did not include the NSCN (IM), which considers itself the principal representative of Naga aspirations.
As a result, NSCN (IM) accused Ravi of attempting to “segregate the Naga civil society”.
Later, R N Ravi resigned as interlocutor for the Naga peace talks.

**********Taking stock of the International Solar Alliance
Context:
India, alongside France, established the International Solar Alliance (ISA) at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference to promote solar energy deployment, particularly in developing nations. This marked a pioneering effort by India in global leadership for clean energy.
Since then, the ISA has grown into an intergovernmental organization with over 110 member countries. Despite its ambitious goals, the ISA's progress in accelerating solar energy adoption in the developing world has been limited.
What’s in today’s article?
ISA's Efforts to Overcome Barriers to Solar Deployment in Developing Countries
India’s leadership role
Background - Global Solar Energy Imbalance and the Role of the ISA
Solar energy is central to the global energy transition needed to combat climate change, being both the fastest-growing renewable source and the cheapest in sunny regions.
Projections show that solar capacity could increase significantly to achieve net zero by 2050.
However, deployment remains uneven: China alone accounts for 43% of global solar capacity, and the top 10 countries hold over 95% of installations.
Africa, home to most of the world's 745 million people without electricity, sees less than 2% of new solar additions.
Additionally, over 80% of solar manufacturing is concentrated in China, limiting rapid solar expansion in smaller markets. The ISA was founded to address and balance this disparity.
About
ISA is a treaty based inter-governmental organization.
ISA was conceived as a
coalition of solar-resource-rich countries
(which lie
either completely or partly between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn
) to address their special energy needs.
It was launched jointly by
India and France
side-lines of COP 21
(held in Paris) in 2015. The Paris Declaration had established the ISA.
It is working to create a global market system to tap the benefits of solar power and promote clean energy applications.
HQ
- Gurugram
Objective
The objective of ISA is to collectively address key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy in line with their needs.
To meet this objective, it aims to pave the way for future solar generation, storage and technologies for Member countries’ needs by mobilising over USD 1000 billion by 2030.
Performance of ISA
ISA was designed to be a facilitator rather than a direct developer of solar projects.
It aimed to help countries address financial, technological, and regulatory barriers to boost solar energy deployment, especially in regions with low energy access.
However, nearly nine years after its inception, the ISA has seen limited impact, with no operational projects yet.
The first ISA-supported project, a 60 MW plant in Cuba, is still in development stages, with other countries in Africa and Latin America preparing for similar projects.
ISA's Limited Impact Amid Global Solar Growth Concentration
Despite rapid global growth in solar energy, with an average 20% annual increase in capacity over the past five years and a 30% rise in 2023 alone, the ISA has struggled to facilitate broad deployment.
According to the ISA's World Solar Market Report 2024, China accounted for 62% (216 GW) of the 345 GW of new solar capacity added in 2023.
Over 80% of solar investments are concentrated in developed nations, China, and large developing countries like India, limiting ISA’s intended impact on smaller or less-developed markets.
ISA has focused on addressing significant entry barriers in smaller developing nations, especially in Africa, where large-scale solar project experience and local developers are lacking.
Foreign investments require stable policies and regulatory frameworks, which ISA is helping to establish by working with governments and local institutions.
Key initiatives include creating regulatory structures, drafting power purchase agreements, and establishing STAR (Solar Technology and Applications Resource) centers to build local expertise.
ISA aims to deploy 1,000 GW of solar power and attract $1 trillion in investment by 2030.
ISA was established not just to promote solar energy but as a strategic initiative for India’s outreach to the Global South, with a particular focus on Africa.
Though an intergovernmental organization, ISA is widely seen as an
Indian initiative due to its New Delhi headquarters, Indian funding, and Indian leadership of its general assembly, which will continue until at least 2026
PM Modi has highlighted ISA’s role as a symbol of India’s leadership for the Global South.
However, ISA’s impact has been limited by underfunding, staffing shortages, and challenges in generating interest in solar energy among energy-deprived nations.
Its underutilization affects India’s ambitions to lead and advocate for these countries on the global stage.

**********Bibek Debroy Committee on Reforms in Indian Railways
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (About Bibek Debroy Committee)
Key Recommendations of the Committee
Implementation Status
Introduction:
The Bibek Debroy Committee, formed in 2014, aimed at
suggesting comprehensive reforms for the Indian Railways
to improve operational efficiency, financial viability, and competitiveness.
Chaired by renowned economist
, the committee published its landmark report in
2015
, proposing extensive changes to transform Indian Railways.
The report highlighted issues across decision-making structures, financial management, human resources, and the need for liberalization within Indian Railways.
Key Recommendations of the Bibek Debroy Committee:
Empowerment of Railway Officers:
The committee emphasized empowering field officers, including General Managers (GMs) and Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs), by
granting them greater decision-making authority
The government has partially implemented this by empowering GMs and DRMs to make independent decisions, handle various tenders, and manage divisions as business units.
Establishment of an Independent Regulator:
A major recommendation was to set up an independent regulatory body to ensure fair competition and regulate pricing.
Rail Development Authority (RDA)
was approved in 2017, intended to provide expert advice on service pricing, enhance non-fare revenue, and foster competition.
Liberalization of Indian Railways:
The committee recommended "liberalization," allowing private operators to participate in rail services to increase competitiveness and improve services.
It clarified that liberalization does not imply "privatization" but aims at creating a competitive environment.
However,
due to opposition from railway unions and political parties, the government has not fully implemented this recommendation
Private participation is limited to select Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects, primarily in freight services.
Redesignation of Railway Board Chairman as CEO:
To expedite decision-making, the committee recommended designating the
Chairman of the Railway Board as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with final decision-making authority
This was implemented in 2020, with the first Chairman and CEO of the Railway Board appointed, making the Board function more like a corporate entity.
Offloading Non-Core Services:
The committee suggested that Indian Railways focus on its core function of running trains, while outsourcing non-core services such as security (Railway Protection Force), medical, and educational facilities for employees.
The government is considering this recommendation to reduce operational burdens and improve focus on core railway services.
Reforms in Accounting System:
A major overhaul of the accounting system was recommended to shift from cash-based accounting to accrual-based accounting, enhancing financial transparency.
This recommendation was implemented through an Accounting Reforms project, with Indian Railways now preparing financial statements on both accrual and cash bases.
Safety Measures and Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK):
In response to the committee's recommendations on safety, the Ministry of Railways created the
in 2017 with a
fund of ₹1 lakh crore for replacing, renewing, and upgrading critical safety assets
In 2022-23, the government extended RRSK with an
additional ₹45,000 crore in budgetary support
Integration of Advanced Technology:
The committee recommended integrating advanced technology to modernize railway operations, including the adoption of high-speed trains like Vande Bharat and safety systems like KAVACH.
The establishment of
Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya
for skill development and capacity building in rail technology aligns with this goal, focusing on empowering the workforce with modern skills.
Implementation Status:
Out of the 40 recommendations made by the committee:
19 were fully accepted
, including the redesignation of the Railway Board Chairman as CEO, accounting reforms, and setting up RRSK.
7 were partially accepted
, such as empowering DRMs and implementing decentralization at the division level.
14 recommendations were rejected
, mainly due to opposition from unions or political considerations, especially regarding liberalization and private sector entry in passenger services.
Conclusion:
The Bibek Debroy Committee's recommendations laid the foundation for a modern, efficient, and financially sustainable Indian Railways.
While several recommendations have been implemented, including structural changes, safety funds, and decentralization, others remain pending due to various challenges.
The reforms introduced have made significant progress, yet the journey to fully modernize Indian Railways continues.

**********Test for Determining Minority Educational Institution (MEI) Status
Why in News?
Without determining whether Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) is a minority institution or not, a 7-judge bench of the Supreme Court overruled by a 4:3 majority a 1967 judgment by a 5-judge bench in Azeez Basha case.
The majority opinion
laid down elaborate parameters
for testing the minority character of an institution and tasked a regular bench to adjudicate the 57-year-old controversy based on the parameters.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background of the AMU Minority Status Case
Constitutional Protections and Benefits of MEIs
SC’s Criteria for Determining MEI Status
Two-Fold Test to Establish Minority Status
Implications of SC Determining MEI Status Test
Conclusion
Background of the AMU Minority Status Case:
AMU’s transformation from MAO college (1920)
The Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental (MAO) college, established in 1877, was converted to AMU in 1920 by a central legislature Act.
The government argued this conversion changed its minority status, which became a pivotal issue in later legal debates.
Azeez Basha case (1967):
The SC held that AMU was not established by the Muslim community but by a central legislature Act in 1920, disqualifying it as a minority institution under
Article 30
of the Constitution.
Government amendments and legal developments (1981-2006):
1981:
An amendment to the AMU Act declared AMU was created by the Muslim community for their educational advancement.
2005:
AMU introduced 50% reservation for Muslims in postgraduate medical courses.
2006:
The Allahabad HC ruled against AMU’s minority status, annulling the 1981 amendment and the 50% reservation policy.
SC referral (2019):
The issue was brought before the Supreme Court, and in 2019, it was referred to a seven-judge Bench.
Constitutional Protections and Benefits of MEIs:
Article 30:
Under Article 30(1), minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions.
Article 15(5):
MEIs are granted special privileges, such as control over admissions and staff hiring, and exemption from reservations for SCs and STs under this provision.
Benefits of minority status:
Minority institutions can reserve up to 50% seats for minority students and enjoy autonomy in administration, fostering cultural and linguistic diversity.
SC’s Criteria for Determining MEI Status:
The SC identified the following:
The institution’s purpose
should primarily aim to conserve minority language and culture.
Minority institutions may admit non-minority students
without losing their minority status.
Secular education does
not undermine minority character.
Government-aided institutions
cannot compel religious instruction; those fully state-funded cannot offer it.
Test for determining minority character:
The SC devised
a two-step test
to identify whether an institution holds a minority character.
Two-Fold Test to Establish Minority Status:
Establishment:
Courts must investigate the origin and purpose of an institution's establishment, identifying community involvement in its formation.
Proof of establishment includes letters, funding records, and communications affirming that the institution’s aim was predominantly for the minority community’s benefit.
Administration:
MEIs are not obligated to appoint only minority members to administrative roles. However, administrative setup should reflect minority interests.
For pre-1950 institutions, courts must review whether the administration affirmed the minority’s interest on the Constitution’s commencement date.
Implications of SC Determining MEI Status Test:
Administrative autonomy affirmed:
This is seen as a significant development for institutions like St Stephen’s College, which is currently in a dispute with Delhi University (DU) over its principal’s reappointment process.
Reignites minority status debate:
The ongoing legal questions surrounding
Jamia Millia Islamia's (JMI)
minority status are closely connected to the AMU case.
According to JMI’s standing counsel, the SC’s decision on AMU’s minority status will likely affect JMI’s case as both involve similar legal principles about institutions created by legislative acts.
Conclusion:
The SC’s verdict
brings AMU closer to securing its minority status
by clarifying criteria for minority character under Article 30.
However, the final determination of AMU’s status awaits further review.
This landmark judgment sets a precedent for MEIs, preserving minority rights in India’s educational framework while ensuring alignment with constitutional provisions.

On the evening of November 8, 1895, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen was conducting experiments in his laboratory at the University of Würzburg in Germany when he made an unusual discovery.
Did you know the Röntgen’s discovery story of X-rays?
While experimenting with cathode rays in a glass vacuum tube, Röntgen noticed a fluorescent screen glowing at a distance, despite being too far to be affected by the rays he was studying.
Intrigued by this unexpected glow, he wondered if this mysterious ray could penetrate organic materials, so he experimented by photographing his wife’s hand, capturing her bones and ring. This was the world’s first recorded X-ray image of the human body.
Röntgen documented his findings in an article titled “On a new kind of rays,” in 1895 which was published by introducing “X-rays” to the scientific community.
How did Röntgen’s discovery transform Medical practices and Diagnostics?
Revolution in Diagnostic Medicine
: Physicians rapidly adopted X-rays, which allowed them to view the human body without surgery. This was transformative for diagnostics, especially in orthopedics and internal medicine.
Surgical Advancements
: By February 1896, British physician Major John Hall-Edwards had successfully used X-rays to guide the surgery. Within months, armies began using X-ray technology to locate bullet wounds and diagnose fractures, marking the beginning of its use in trauma care.
What are the long-term implications of Röntgen’s discovery on Public health and Safety?
Development of Radiology
: this discovery led to the birth of radiology, with subsequent advancements leading to CT, MRI, ultrasound, and other imaging technologies that are essential in modern medicine.
Radiation Safety and Awareness
: Initially, x-rays were used liberally, even for non-medical purposes (such as in shoe stores to fit footwear), with little awareness of potential harm. It wasn’t until early reports of radiation burns and later research in the early 20th century that the health risks of radiation exposure were acknowledged, prompting the development of safety protocols.
Ongoing Safety Protocols
: Today, radiation safety is central to radiology practices. Equipment advancements and regulatory standards have minimized exposure risks, making x-rays safe for patients and medical personnel while ensuring their continued benefits.
Public Health and Preventive Care
: The ability to detect diseases, fractures, and other internal injuries without invasive procedures has been crucial for preventive care, enabling early detection and treatment. This has significantly impacted patient survival rates and quality of care, solidifying diagnostic imaging as a pillar of modern public health.
Issues related to X-ray machines in Rural areas:
Limited X-ray Equipment
: Rural Community Health Centres (CHCs) in India often need more X-ray machines, with
only 68%
of available units functioning, primarily due to high operational costs and shortages of technicians.
Maintenance and Operational Delays
: Even when X-ray machines are present, many remain non-functional due to installation delays and insufficient maintenance, as imaging services are not prioritized in CHC guidelines.
Access and Specialist Shortages
: Rural patients face long travel distances to access imaging services, further limited by a concentration of radiologists in urban areas, reducing timely access to diagnostic interpretation.
Way forward:
Strengthen Infrastructure and Access
: Increase the availability and functionality of X-ray machines in rural areas by improving equipment maintenance, investing in portable and mobile X-ray units to bring diagnostic services directly to underserved populations.
For example,
Teleradiology
enables remote interpretation of images, improving access to diagnostic services.
Telemedicine and Remote Diagnostics
: Expand telemedicine platforms like ‘
XraySetu’
, enabling healthcare workers in rural areas to share X-ray images for remote analysis by radiologists, improving diagnostic capabilities without requiring patients to travel long distances.

**********SC overrules 1967 verdict on AMU’s minority tag
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Judiciary; Landmark Judgements; Issues related to Minority status;
Why in the News?
In a 4:3 majority decision, the Supreme Court
overturned
its
1967 Azeez Basha ruling
, which had denied
Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) minority status
, directing that AMU’s status be reassessed according to the principles outlined in the current judgment.
Constitutional Provisions and Historical Background of the case:
The Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) was founded in
1875
and incorporated by imperial law in
1920
Article 30 of the Constitution
empowers religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions – AMU had enjoyed minority status.
1951 amendment
to that imperial law, the AMU Act, did away with compulsory religious instructions for Muslim students.
In India, compulsory religious instruction is prohibited in state-funded educational institutions under
Article 28.
S. Azeez Basha vs. Union of India (1967),
the SC ruled that AMU could not be considered a minority institution, as it was established by a central act, categorizing it as a central university.
This ruling denied AMU the rights of minority institutions under
of the Indian Constitution.
1981
, an amendment to the
attempted to restore AMU’s minority character, aiming to secure rights for it as a minority-administered institution.
Allahabad High Court (
2006)
struck down the 1981 amendment,
reinforcing the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling
and reasserting that AMU did not qualify as a minority institution.
What criteria will be used to assess AMU’s minority status?
The SC emphasized that an educational institution must be established by a minority community to qualify for minority status under
Article 30(1)
This involves examining who initiated the idea of the institution and whether it was primarily intended to
benefit that community
Holistic Two-Fold Test:
The Court introduced a two-fold test:
First Limb:
Identify the “brain behind” the establishment, which includes reviewing correspondence and documentation that reflect the intentions of the founders.
Second Limb:
Assess whether the administrative structure of the institution affirms its minority character and serves to protect and promote the interests of the minority community.
Broad Interpretation of “Established”:
The ruling clarified that “established” should be interpreted broadly, meaning that an institution can still be considered a minority institution even if it is governed by a statutory body or has undergone changes in its legal status over time.
How does this ruling affect the legal precedent set by the 1967 Azeez Basha case?
The overruling of Azeez Basha:
The SC’s decision effectively overruled its previous 1967 ruling, which had declared AMU as not being a minority institution because it was established through a government statute rather than directly by a minority community.
New Framework for Minority Status:
This ruling marks a shift towards a more inclusive interpretation of what constitutes a minority institution, allowing for a reassessment of AMU’s status based on historical context and community intent rather than solely on formal legal definitions.
Legal Autonomy Reaffirmed:
The judgment underscores that legislative recognition does not negate an institution’s minority character, challenging previous interpretations that linked statutory establishment with loss of minority status.
What are the implications of this ruling for Educational rights and Reservations?
Potential for Reservations:
If AMU is recognized as a minority institution, it could reserve seats specifically for Muslim students in various programs without needing to adhere to general reservation policies applicable to
Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST),
Other Backward Classes (OBC
) under
Article 15(5)
of the Constitution.
Autonomy in Administration:
The ruling provides AMU greater autonomy in managing its affairs, including admissions and staff appointments, thereby allowing it to align its policies with the interests of the Muslim community it serves.
Broader Educational Rights:
This decision reinforces the constitutional rights granted to minorities under Article 30(1), ensuring that they can establish and administer educational institutions without undue interference from state laws, thereby promoting educational diversity in India.
Way forward:
Define Minority Status Framework
: Parliament could establish a clear legislative framework based on the Supreme Court’s criteria, ensuring consistent and streamlined recognition of minority institutions across India.
Balance Autonomy and Accountability
: Policies should support minority institutions’ autonomy while maintaining accountability to uphold educational standards, ensuring both community-focused goals and inclusive, high-quality education.
