**********TRAI's Proposal on Broadband Tariffs under PM-WANI
Recently, TRAI has proposed a reduction in broadband rates for Public Data Offices (PDOs) under the PM-WANI scheme to make internet access more affordable and boost the program's success.
Background
: The
Prime Minister Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM-WANI)
scheme was launched in 2020 which aims to democratise broadband access via public Wi-Fi hotspots. However, the program has faced challenges due to the high cost of connectivity charged by
Telecom Service Providers (TSPs)
Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
Current tariff issues
PDOs have been charged up to
₹8 lakh annually
for Internet leased lines, making the project economically unviable.
In contrast, personal broadband connections are available at rates as low as
₹300-400 per month.
TRAI's Solution
: Proposed tariffs for PDOs under the PM-WANI scheme should be aligned with retail broadband (FTTH) rates to support small-scale PDOs like local shops, kiranawalas, and storekeepers.
TRAI plans to review the proposed tariff arrangement after two years, based on the scheme's progress.
Targets vs. Reality
As of July 2024, there are
207,642
deployed PM-WANI Wi-Fi hotspots, far below the
National Digital Communications Policy 2018
target of
5 million by 2020.
For
Digital India 2030,
the target is set at
50 million public Wi-Fi hotspots.
The average daily data usage per hotspot has dropped significantly, highlighting the need for tariff rationalization.
About PM-WANI Scheme:
Launch
: Initiated by the
Department of Telecommunications (DoT)
in December 2020.
Objective
: To provide affordable, high-speed internet connectivity, particularly in rural and remote areas, through a nationwide public Wi-Fi network.

**********ISRO’s Chandrayaan-4 Mission
Why in the News?
The designs of India’s next mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan-4 has been finalized, and will most likely happen in 2027, said ISRO chairman S Somanath said on the occasion of National Space Day.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Chandrayaan-4 Mission (Objectives, Strategy, Components, Payloads, etc.)
News Summary
Chandrayaan-4 Mission:
Following the success of Chandrayaan-3, ISRO is now turning its attention to Chandrayaan-4, a lunar sample-return mission.
This ambitious project aims to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, collect lunar rock samples, and return them to Earth.
If successful, India would join the ranks of the United States, Russia, and China in accomplishing this challenging feat.
Key Objectives of the Mission:
Achieving a safe and gentle landing on the lunar surface.
Collecting and storing lunar samples.
Lifting off from the Moon's surface.
Docking and undocking in lunar orbit.
Transferring samples between spacecraft modules.
Returning the collected samples safely to Earth.
Mission Strategy and Components:
Chandrayaan-4’s strategy is notably complex, involving five distinct components of the spacecraft:
Propulsion System
: Responsible for transporting the lander and ascender stages to the Moon.
Descender
: Designed for the lunar landing, carrying equipment for soil sampling.
Ascender
: Detaches from the lander after collecting samples, then lifts off from the lunar surface.
Transfer Module
: Receives samples from the Ascender and transports them to the Re-entry module.
Re-entry Module
: Safely brings the lunar samples back to Earth, designed to withstand the re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.
Detailed Payloads:
Lunar Propulsion Module
: Transports the Lunar Lander and Ascender stages to the Moon, similar to the propulsion module used in Chandrayaan-3.
: Touches down on the Moon, carrying instruments to support the Ascender stage and soil sampling equipment.
Lunar Module Ascender
: After collecting samples, it detaches from the Lander, ascends to lunar orbit, and prepares for docking.
: Transfers the samples from the Ascender to the Re-entry Module, propelling them back to Earth.
: Designed to safely return to Earth with the lunar samples.
Dual Rocket Launch Strategy:
Chandrayaan-4 will utilize two different rockets:
Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LMV-3)
: The heavy lifter will carry the propulsion, descender, and ascender modules.
Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)
: The workhorse will transport the transfer and re-entry modules to their designated lunar orbits. These rockets will be launched on different dates, with the earliest launch not expected before 2028.
Advanced Technology and Space Docking Experiment (SPADEX):
The mission’s success will hinge on the successful docking of the Ascender Module with the Transfer Module in lunar orbit, a process that relies on the completion of the Space Docking Experiment (SPADEX).
This experiment, developed by ISRO, involves two spacecraft and aims to advance technologies for orbital rendezvous, docking, and formation flying, which are crucial for the Chandrayaan-4 mission.
By leveraging these sophisticated technologies and innovative strategies, ISRO aims to advance India’s capabilities in lunar exploration and bring back samples from the Moon, marking another significant milestone in the country's space exploration journey.
ISRO’s Chandrayaan-4 Mission:
ISRO has finalized the design for Chandrayaan-4, India’s next Moon mission, which aims to bring lunar rock and soil samples back to Earth, with the mission likely to occur in 2027.
Chandrayaan-4 will be more complex than its predecessor, involving five separate modules and requiring two space docking operations— a first for ISRO.
Two key capabilities for this mission were successfully tested during Chandrayaan-3.
Final government approval is awaited
. Additionally,
ISRO has also completed the design for Chandrayaan-5
, though its objectives and timeline are yet to be disclosed.

Key findings
Impact on Indian Economy
India’s space sector has directly contributed about $24 billion (₹20,000 crore) to India’s GDP over the last decade.
It has directly supported
96,000 jobs in the public and private sector
For every dollar produced by the space sector, there was a
multiplier effect of $2.54 to the Indian economy
India’s space force was 2.5 times more productive than the country’s broader industrial workforce.
8th largest space economy (in terms of funding) in the world
With $13 billion invested in the last decade it is the 8th largest space economy (in terms of funding) in the world.
Satellite communications contributed 54% to the space economy, followed by navigation (26%) and launches (11%).
Diversified space sector
The Indian space sector was diversifying and now had 700 companies including 200 start-ups.
It had seen revenues grow to $6.3 billion in 2023, which was about 1.5% of the global space market.
Way ahead
India's space sector has significantly enhanced the nation's prestige, sovereignty, and global leadership, but its impact on the profitability and competitiveness of companies within the country has been limited.
According to industry stakeholders, this is because the space program over the past decade has been primarily driven by political considerations.
However, there is a shift occurring as commercial space is becoming a priority.
Regulatory reforms have been introduced but have yet to fully take effect, and an under-developed venture capital ecosystem is hindering space technology start-ups from accessing necessary capital.

India presented four BHISHM Cubes to Ukraine
PM Modi presented four BHISHM Cubes to Ukraine, which include medical equipment and supplies for emergency treatment and surgery.
BHISM stands for Bharat Health Initiative for Sahyog Hita & Maitri
. It is a mobile hospital aimed at providing emergency medical care to Ukraine.
Bhishm was initiated under the umbrella of
Project Aarogya Maitri
, a programme to provide crucial medical supplies to developing nations for humanitarian aid.
The purpose of the initiative is to deliver all basic facilities and equipment for providing emergency medical care in an easy to use and rapidly deployable manner.
This
consists of
all essential medicines and equipment in cubical boxes that are each of 15 inches, in a well-organised manner
They are arranged in accordance with the type of medical assistance and injuries that could happen in a war or natural disaster.
These mini cubes are said to be then positioned on a strong, adjustable, which allows multi-mode transportation -by air, sea, land and drone.
In addition to this, the cubes can be carried by an individual too as their maximum weight is 20 kg.
As per the officials, one cube can manage about 200 emergency situations of diverse nature including trauma, bleeding, burns, fractures, shock, along with managing initial triage and classification.
They also said that the cubes also provide the ability to support basic surgeries and can generate power and oxygen in limited amounts and duration.
Four landmark agreements were reached
India and Ukraine signed four agreements to provide for cooperation in
agriculture, medicine, culture & humanitarian assistance
PM Modi's visit to Kyiv marks a significant diplomatic shift for India, as it re-engages with Ukraine and asserts itself in the global geopolitical landscape amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. This visit highlights three key developments:
India's Role in European Peace Efforts
Modi's engagement with Ukrainian President demonstrates India's commitment to understanding Ukraine's concerns and contributing to global peace efforts.
This positions
India as a more active participant in resolving the conflict, especially in the Global South
Diplomatic and Strategic Space
Modi's visit signals India's intention to play a more proactive role in shaping global power dynamics, particularly in Europe.
This is contrasted with China's growing influence in the region and the U.S.'s evolving stance on its involvement in European security.
Ukraine is not only about renewed contest between Russia and the West but also about the role of Delhi and Beijing in Europe
Reviving India-Ukraine Relations
Modi's visit also seeks to restore and enhance India's ties with Ukraine, which had been neglected post-Soviet Union.
The commitment to a strategic partnership, along with economic, defense, and cultural cooperation, represents a significant renewal of the relationship between the two nations.

**********Reviving the PM-WANI Scheme
Why in News?
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has released a draft Telecommunication Tariff (70th Amendment) Order 2024 on "Regulatory framework for PM-WANI scheme”.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the PM-WANI Scheme?
Status of Public Wi-Fi Hotspots under PM-WANI
Reasons for the Poor Penetration of Public Wi-Fi Hotspots
Changes Proposed by the Draft Telecommunication Tariff (70th Amendment) Order 2024
The Prime Minister’s Wi-Fi Access Network Interface
(PM-WANI) was launched by the Department of Telecommunication (Ministry of Communications, GoI) in
2020
The scheme aims
To enhance the proliferation of
public Wi-Fi hotspots
to create robust digital communications infrastructure in the country, especially in rural areas.
To increase employment
for small and micro-entrepreneurs and provide low-cost internet to the underserved urban poor and rural households.
To encourage local shops and establishments
to provide Wi-Fi for last-mile internet delivery which does not require a licence or charge a registration fee.
To access public hotspots
under the scheme one needs to download a relevant App which shows the available networks.
The user can then choose from a list of available connections and
make a payment
to use the network till his/her balance is exhausted.
PM-WANI ecosystem consists of 4 parts:
Public Data Office (PDO), Public Data Office Aggregator (PDOA), App Provider, and Central Registry.
(local shops/ retailers, kiranawalas, storekeepers, etc) establishes the Wi-Fi Hotspots and provides internet access to users.
provides authorisation and accounting services to PDOs.
The app provider
displays the available hotspots in the phone’s proximity.
The central registry
overseen by the Centre for Development of Telematics maintains details of App Providers, PDOs, and PDOAs.
The benefits of PM-WANI include
enhanced internet penetration (especially in rural areas), which will
narrow the digital divide, help boost digital India
and could lead to an increase in GDP.
Status of Public Wi-Fi Hotspots under PM-WANI:
The National Digital Communications Policy 2018
under ‘Connect India’ mission had set the goal to enable deployment of 10 million public Wi-Fi hotspots by 2022 for creating a robust digital communication infrastructure.
Further, the Bharat 6G Vision
also sets the goal of 10 million public Wi-Fi hotspots by 2022 and 50 million by 2030 for Digital India 2030 mobile and broadband policy objectives.
However, PM-Wani hotspot numbers presently are
much below the targeted numbers.
For instance
, as per the information gathered from PM-Wani Central Registry,
There were
only 207,642 deployed PM-Wani Wi-Fi hotspots
in the country and 199 PDOs and 111 app providers (as of July 2024).
The average daily data usage
per Wi-Fi hotspot was of the order of 1 GB till last year, and now it has come down to a few MBs.
This is quite less than the monthly average data limit being provided to retail broadband customers.
Reasons for the Poor Penetration of Public Wi-Fi Hotspots:
This is mainly due to the
extremely high cost of backhaul internet connectivity
charged by Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from Public Data Offices (PDOs).
Backhaul is the physical part of a network that connects the core network to local networks
Also, TSPs/ISPs often insist on PDOs to connect public Wi-Fi Access Points using
expensive Internet Leased Lines (ILL)
instead of regular Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH) broadband connections.
For comparison, 100 Mbps of ILL rate versus an FTTH broadband connection showed that ILLs are 40 to 80 times higher than the retail connection.
As most small-scale shop owners are unable to pay the high tariffs applicable to commercial entities, there are not many public Wi-Fi hotspots under the scheme.
Changes Proposed by the Draft Telecommunication Tariff (70th Amendment) Order 2024:
The telecom regulator has proposed
a lower cost structure
under the PM-Wani scheme.
For example,
tariff for PDO under the PM-Wani scheme shall be the same as is applicable for retail broadband (FTTH) connections.
This will
rationalise
the cost of broadband connectivity to PDOs and will
pace up
the proliferation of the public Wi-Fi hotspots.

Polity & Governance
**********How to ensure dignity for the terminally ill?  
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Need legal clarity of Patient Rights;
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court of India
denied permission
to the parents of Harish Rana, a 32-year-old man in a vegetative state for 11 years, to
remove his Ryles tube which is a device used for feeding.
A Ryles tube, also known as a
nasogastric (NG) tube,
is a medical device used for various purposes related to
nutrition and gastric management.
It is inserted through the nose, passing through the nasal cavity, down the esophagus, and into the stomach.
Recent Supreme Court Judgment:
The Bench headed by
CJI D.Y. Chandrachud
observed that the
Ryles tube is not a life support system and therefore could not be withdrawn.
This decision has
stirred legal and ethical debates,
as the
Supreme Court’s 2018 judgment permits the withdrawal of life support in terminal cases under the concept of
“passive euthanasia.”
Passive euthanasia
involves the
withdrawal of medical treatment
with the intention of hastening the
death of a terminally ill patient.
initially legalized this practice in 2018,
allowing patients to create a
“living will”
to refuse life-sustaining treatment when they are unable to communicate their wishes.
Ethical Challenges:
Question of whether the decision benefits the patient:
The judgment raises concerns about whether the decision benefits the patient, as prolonging life in such a condition may increase suffering.
Prolonged suffering:
The principle of not causing harm is challenged since keeping the patient in a vegetative state with artificial feeding may lead to prolonged suffering for both the patient and their caregivers.
Against Right to Life and Death:
The patient’s rights to a dignified life and death may be compromised which is addressed in various judgments like
Common Cause v. Union of India (2018).
This judgment recognised the
right to die with dignity
as part of the right to life under Article 21.
Autonomy:
The patient’s right to choose, which is central to the concept of dignity, has been overlooked. The judgment did not consider the wishes of the patient or their family in determining the course of action.
Need for Legal Clarity:
Distinguishing Euthanasia from Withdrawal of Life Support:
There is a pressing need to
legally clarify the difference between
euthanasia and the withdrawal of futile life-sustaining interventions.
Involvement of Medical and Ethical Experts:
The decision-making process in such sensitive cases should
involve palliative care physicians and ethical experts
to ensure that medical and ethical considerations are fully addressed.
Advance Care Planning:
Promoting Advance Medical Directives and Advance Care Planning is crucial to
empower individuals to have control over their end-of-life decisions
, ensuring that their rights to a good quality of life and death are respected.
Systemic Reforms:
The judgment highlights the need for systemic reforms to
avoid forcing families into legal battles and to ensure that patients’ rights are safeguarded
with appropriate legal frameworks.
Conclusion:
The recent Supreme Court judgment highlights the urgent need for legal clarity, ethical considerations, and systemic reforms to protect patient rights and ensure dignity in end-of-life decisions.
Mains question for practice:
Discuss the need for legal clarity and systemic reforms to uphold the dignity and rights of patients in end-of-life decisions.

**********Time to reset the GST system   
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Taxation; Issues related to GST;
Why in the News?
Most states appear to be opposed to altering the current five primary GST rate slabs: 0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%.
About Goods and Service Tax (GST):
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India was introduced by the Constitutional (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act of 2017. It is a
unified tax
system that replaced multiple indirect taxes levied by both the Central and State Governments.
Under GST, the
(CGST) and state government (SGST) share the authority
to levy and collect taxes
on goods and services. In the case of Inter-state transactions,
Integrated GST
(IGST) is applicable.
Essential Features of GST
Multiple Tax Levels:
India’s GST system has multiple tax rates, with
four primary tax rates
(5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%). Additionally, there is a “
zero rate
” for certain essential goods and services (e.g. exports).
One Nation, One Tax:
GST is based on the
principles of value-added tax
and applies
to the supply of goods and services across the nation.
It brings uniformity in the tax structure across India, eliminating the cascading effect of taxes.
Destination-Based Tax:
This means that the revenue generated from GST is collected by the state where the goods or services are consumed, rather than where they are produced.
Eliminating Cascading Effect:
Under the Indian GST system, businesses can claim
input tax credit
for the GST they paid on their purchases. This ensures that taxes are levied only on the value added at each stage of the supply chain.
Sector-specific Exemptions:
Certain sectors, such as healthcare, education, and basic necessities like food grains, are either exempted from GST or have reduced tax rates to ensure affordability and accessibility.
Threshold Exemption:
Small businesses with a turnover below a specified threshold (currently, it is
20 lakhs:
supplier of both goods & services and
40 lakhs:
for supplier of goods (Intra–State) in India) are exempt from GST.
Present Challenges in GST Rates
Complexity and Confusion:
The existence of
multiple GST slabs creates confusion
for businesses and consumers alike. Different rates for similar items lead to complications in compliance and classification, resulting in litigation and disputes.
For instance, the GST on cement is
28%, while essential items like milk are exempt,
yet products derived from milk, such as
skimmed milk powder, are taxed at 5%.
Anomalies in Taxation:
There are notable inconsistencies in the application of GST rates. For example, the
taxation of medical and life insurance premiums at 18% is seen as burdensome for individuals seeking financial protection against uncertainties
Need to simplify the current GST Slabs
Rationalization Proposal:
There is a growing consensus among industry experts and some government officials that the GST structure should be
simplified to a maximum of three slabs.
This would not only streamline compliance but also reduce the administrative burden on businesses and the government alike.
Economic Stimulus:
Simplifying GST rates could potentially stimulate economic activity by
lowering indirect tax burdens, encouraging consumption,
and ultimately leading to higher tax revenues.
Why are states resisting?
Fear of Revenue Loss:
Many states are apprehensive about the
implications of changing the GST
structure, fearing that it might
lead to a decrease in their revenue streams
Political Considerations:
The political landscape also plays a role in the resistance to change. With upcoming elections and the
need to maintain fiscal health,
state governments may prioritize short-term revenue stability over long-term structural reforms.
Way forward:
Phased Implementation:
Start by introducing pilot programs in select states or sectors to test the impact of GST simplification. This approach can help address specific concerns and refine the model before a nationwide rollout.
Revenue Protection Schemes:
Develop robust mechanisms to compensate states for any potential revenue losses during the transition. This could involve a formula-based compensation fund or a temporary revenue guarantee.
Mains PYQ:
Explain the rationale behind the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act of 2017. How has COVID-19 impacted the GST compensation fund and created new federal tensions?

requires a six-fold increase in per capita Gross National Income (GNI),
emphasizing the
need for comprehensive development, especially in
agriculture.
Trade Goal:
India’s agricultural and processed food exports have gone up to more than USD 50 billion in 2022-23.
The Vision 2047 aims to improve the availability of nutritious foods by enhancing the processing of fruits and vegetables, and augment the proportion of
value-added products in India’s export portfolio.
Sustainable Goal
: Transforming Indian agriculture will hinge on
adopting sustainable practices
such as precision farming, genetically
modified crops, and advanced irrigation techniques (e.g., drip and sprinkler systems).
Present starking Imbalance in the Indian Economy
Workforce vs. GDP Contribution

46% of the workforce,
it contributes only about
18% to the GDP
, revealing a significant imbalance.
Growth Disparity
: While the overall GDP has grown at
6.1% annually since 1991-92, agricultural GDP has lagged at 3.3%
. In the last decade (2013- 2023), overall GDP growth was
5.9%, with agriculture growing at 3.6%,
which is insufficient for the sector’s socio-economic importance.
Future Projections
: By 2047, agriculture’s share in GDP might
shrink to 7%-8%,
but it could still employ over
30% of the workforce,
necessitating significant structural changes to avoid exacerbating the disparity.
Government Initiatives:
For Water Management

, disbursing
₹6,000 annually to farmers
, has benefited over
11.8 crore farmers.
For enhanced Soil Health
Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme
aims to optimize soil nutrient use, enhancing productivity, with over
23 crore SHCs distributed.
Need for Strategic Planning
Population Growth
: India’s population is projected to
reach 1.5 billion by 2030 and 1.59 billion by 2040
, increasing the demand for food by approximately 2.85% annually.
Future Demand
: By 2047-48, food grain demand is projected to range from
402 million tonnes to 437 million tonnes,
requiring sustainable production exceeding demand by 10%-13% under the Business-As-Usual scenario.
Way Forward:
Investment in R&D
: To meet future demands sustainably, significant
investments in agricultural research, infrastructure, and policy support are necessary.
Budget Allocation
: The Budget for 2024-25 includes ₹20 lakh crore for
targeted agricultural credit and the launch of the Agriculture Accelerator Fund
highlighting a proactive approach to fostering agricultural innovation and growth.
Enhance Digital Infrastructure
: Support and expand
digital platforms like eNAM
to improve market access, provide real-time data, and facilitate better price realization for farmers.
