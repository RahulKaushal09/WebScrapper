US Federal Reserve's Rate Cut and Implications
Source: TH
Why in News?
Recently, the
United States (US) Federal Reserve
cut its benchmark
interest rates by 50 basis points
, marking its first significant reduction since the onset of the
Covid-19 pandemic.
This move signals a strategic approach to combat inflation while promoting economic growth.
Why Did the US Federal Reserve Cut Interest Rates?
Economic Recovery Post-Pandemic:
Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the  Federal Reserve initially slashed interest rates to stimulate the economy. However, as
surged due to various factors, including
global supply chain disruptions (due to
Russia-Ukraine Conflict
),
the Federal Reserve raised rates to combat rising prices.
Moderation of Inflation:
By mid-2023, inflation had started to stabilise, moving closer to the
Federal Reserve's target of 2%.
Recent jobs data showed that
high interest rates were negatively impacting employment,
with
U.S.
unemployment
rising to 4.2% in August 2024.
This raised concerns about a
potential
recession
prompting the Federal Reserve to prioritize job creation alongside price stability.
Dual Mandate
: The Federal Reserve operates under a
dual mandate of maintaining stable prices and achieving maximum employment.
As the economic landscape evolved, it became clear that a
rate cut would help balance these objectives.
Implications for US:
By cutting rates, the US hopes to balance inflationary pressures. Although inflation has moderated, the central bank is focused on maintaining its
target rate of around 2%,
seeking a “soft landing” for the economy.
Lower interest rates typically make loans cheaper for both individuals and businesses. With unemployment rising, the Fed is prioritising job creation alongside price stability.
The rate cut could help
reduce borrowing costs for businesses, potentially leading to increased hiring
and economic expansion.
How Inflation and Unemployment are Related?
Inverse Correlation:
Generally, inflation and unemployment are inversely related—when one rises, the other falls.
During
periods of low unemployment, wage inflation tends to rise
as employers offer higher wages to attract workers, eventually pushing prices higher.
Conversely,
in times of high unemployment,
wage growth remains stagnant,
leading to lower inflation.
Phillips Curve
is an economic theory that explains the inverse relationship between an
economy's unemployment rate and inflation rate,
as initially suggested by A.W. Phillips in the 1950s.
The Phillips curve suggests that
higher demand for labour during low unemployment periods leads to higher wages,
which, in turn, drives inflation.
This model has been widely used in monetary policy, particularly in balancing inflation and employment levels.

How will India be Affected by the Federal Reserve Rate Cut?
Impact on Emerging Markets:
The US plays a significant role in the global economy. A lower US interest rate makes
investing in countries like India more appealing through
carry trades.
Carry trade is a strategy where
investors(
Foreign Institutional investors
) borrow money in the US (where rates are low)
and invest it where rates are higher, making a profit on the difference.
Limited Impact:
Chief Economic Adviser of India noted that while the
rate cut could lower the dollar cost of capital and increase liquidity,
it cannot be viewed as a standalone solution for boosting the global economy.
Increased Foreign Investment
: Lower US interest rates may incentivize global investors to borrow in the US and invest in India. This influx could take the form of
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
or debt from the US,
providing much-needed capital for the Indian economy.
Stock Market Sentiment:
The rate cut has attracted
considerable investor interest in the
Indian stock market
indicating a positive sentiment among investors despite global uncertainties.
Crude Oil Prices:
When the US dollar weakens,
oil becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies
, leading to increased demand and potentially higher prices.
Increased oil prices may
increase India's energy import costs
and potentially reigniting inflation in India.
Impact on Currency Exchange Rates
: A weakening US dollar against other currencies, including the Indian rupee, could adversely affect
Indian exporters while benefiting importers
RBI’s Response
Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
faces pressure to cut interest rates, but it operates
under different
inflation targets
and economic mandates compared to the Federal Reserve.
The RBI is more focused on
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth and is not as heavily influenced by US unemployment data.
