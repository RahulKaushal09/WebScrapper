India’s EV Revolution
About the PM E-DRIVE Scheme
India’s EV Revolution:
Need:
At the COP26 to the UNFCCC
(held in Glasgow, UK, in 2021), the Indian PM presented to the world
Panchamrit
of India’s climate action plan.
The Panchamrit/ the 5 nectar elements included:
Increasing non-fossil fuel capacity by 500 GW by 2030.
50% of its energy requirements will come from renewable energy by 2030.
Reduction of total projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes from now to 2030.
Reduction of the carbon intensity of the economy by 45% by 2030, over 2005 levels.
Achieving the target of net zero emissions by 2070.
Apart from this, the Indian PM also highlighted ‘Lifestyle for Environment’ (
LiFE
) - a global mission asserting the need to follow a sustainable lifestyle.
Electric vehicles (EVs) can help India achieve
its Panchamrit and LiFE goals by reducing emissions, improving energy security, etc.
Steps taken by India:
National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMPP):
The MHI launched the NEMMP 2020 in 2013 for deploying 5 to 7 million EVs in the country by 2020, lowering vehicular emissions by 1.3 to 1.5% by 2020, etc.
The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) India Scheme:
Launched as part of the NEMPP, the FAME India scheme has been implemented since 1st April
2015
Under this,
subsidies
are being given to promote manufacturing of electric and hybrid vehicle technology and to ensure
sustainable growth
of the same.
Subsidies are meant to bring a price parity
between vehicles that have electric motors and fossil fuel-run engines, thereby
nudging buyers
to go for the cleaner option.
The first phase -
, ran for four years until 2019. Under the
FAME II
(which ended on 31
March 2024), companies can -
Offer
a discount of up to 40% on the cost of locally manufactured vehicles
Claim it as a subsidy from the government.
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the Automotive Sector:
To boost domestic manufacturing of advanced automotive technology (AAT) products and attract investments in the automotive manufacturing value chain.
PLI Scheme for National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage
: To enhance capabilities for the manufacture of ACC in India.
Achievements of India’s EV revolution:
The value of the Indian EV market in 2023 was US$2bn, and the projection by 2025 is US$7.1bn, with the domestic market achieving 10 million annual sales by 2030.
Two-wheelers are driving this development
, and they will make up 40-50% of all EVs sold in India by 2030.
Over the past two years,
the number of public chargers skyrocketed
from a modest 1,800 to an impressive 16,347.
EV revolution in India faces several challenges:
Such as poor charging infrastructure, high cost (more expensive than conventional vehicles), battery lifespan, talent gap, lack of standardisation (of charging infra and techs) and regulatory challenges (like unclear guidelines).
About the PM E-DRIVE Scheme:
Objectives:
The scheme seeks to
accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in India by offering upfront incentives
for their purchase and facilitating the creation of necessary charging infrastructure.
Its goal is to
reduce the environmental impact of transportation
and improve air quality through the promotion of EVs, mass public transportation, and advanced EV technologies.
Key highlights:
Subsidies and demand incentives:
The scheme allocates Rs 3,679 crore to incentivise the purchase of electric two-wheelers (e-2Ws), three-wheelers (e-3Ws), electric ambulances, trucks, and other emerging EV categories.
E-Vouchers for EV buyers:
Buyers of electric vehicles will be issued an e-voucher under the scheme to avail demand incentives.
The e-voucher will be Aadhaar-authenticated and sent to the buyer's registered mobile number after the purchase.
E-Ambulance deployment:
A budget of Rs 500 crore has been allocated to deploy electric ambulances. This new initiative aims to provide comfortable and environmentally friendly patient transport.
E-Buses for public transport:
Rs 4,391 crore has been earmarked for the procurement of 14,028 e-buses by State Transport Undertakings (STUs) and public transport agencies.
Incentives for E-Trucks:
Rs 500 crore has been allocated to promote the deployment of e-trucks, a major contributor to air pollution.
Charging infrastructure:
To address range anxiety and support the growth of electric vehicles, Rs 2,000 crore will be used to install public charging stations (EVPCS) in cities with high EV penetration and along selected highways.
Modernisation of testing facilities:
An additional Rs 780 crore has been approved to modernise MHI’s test agencies, ensuring they are equipped to handle new and emerging green mobility technologies.

Why in news?
The Attorney General of India, R. Venkataramani, addressed the Supreme Court regarding the
"effectuation of Fundamental Duties"
. He emphasized that it is a
requiring
duty-specific legislation, schemes, and supervision
What’s in today’s article?
Observation made by Attorney General of India in Supreme Court
About
Fundamental Duties are moral obligations laid down by the Constitution of India that every citizen is expected to follow.
These duties are enshrined in
Article 51A under Part IV-A
of the Constitution.
These duties emphasize the responsibility of citizens to uphold the spirit of the Constitution and contribute to the nation’s development and well-being.
Although
these duties are not legally enforceable
, they serve as a guiding principle to foster a sense of civic responsibility.
The fundamental duties are taken from the USSR (Russia) constitution.
The addition of fundamental duties in our constitution have brought our constitution aligned with the Article 29(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with various provisions of the modern constitution of other countries.
Evolution and Amendments
Original Constitution (1950):
The Indian Constitution, at the time of its adoption, did not contain any provisions related to Fundamental Duties.
42nd Amendment (1976):
During the Emergency period, the Swaran Singh Committee was appointed by the government to suggest constitutional amendments.
Based on its recommendations, Part IV-A and Article 51A were added, incorporating
10 Fundamental Duties
to remind citizens of their moral responsibilities.
86th Amendment (2002):
The 11th Fundamental Duty was added, making it the duty of parents or guardians to provide opportunities for education to their children.
As of now, Article 51A outlines the following
11 Fundamental Duties
for Indian citizens.
Important Supreme Court Judgments Regarding Fundamental Duties
Chandra Bhavan Boarding and Lodging v State of Mysore (1969)
Emphasised that the Constitution conceives of both rights and duties.
M.C. Mehta v Kamal Nath II (2000)
The court recognized the
importance of protecting the environment as one of the fundamental duties
and upheld the responsibility of citizens to contribute toward its preservation.
It emphasised that Article 51A(g) imposes a duty on every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment and to have compassion for living creatures.

recommendations of the Justice J.S. Verma Committee
with respect to disseminating information on Fundamental Duties to the public.
Javed v State of Haryana (2003)
The apex Court emphasized that
Fundamental Duties are just as important as Fundamental Rights and must be honored for the progress of society
The Judgment stressed that Fundamental Rights must be read in conjunction with the Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties.
In Re Ramlila Maidan Incident v Home Secretary (2012)
The court emphasised that while citizens are entitled to Fundamental Rights,
a Fundamental Duty to obey lawful orders and extend full cooperation in maintaining public order and tranquility is cast on citizens
The "effectuation of fundamental duties" refers to the process or measures taken to ensure that the
enshrined in the Indian Constitution are actively implemented, observed, and followed by citizens.
Ways To Effectuate These Duties
Awareness and education campaigns
Inclusion in school curricula
to instill a sense of responsibility in children.
Government initiatives or policies
encouraging compliance (e.g., promoting respect for the national symbols, environmental conservation).
Judicial interpretation
: Courts sometimes reference Fundamental Duties when interpreting laws or issuing judgments to reinforce civic responsibility.
Justice Verma Committee for effectuation of duties
The committee was formed in 1998 in response to the need for an effective plan for the enforcement of Fundamental Duties, with the goal of instilling a sense of responsibility and civic consciousness in individuals from an early age.
following laws were identified by the committee
for the enforcement of some of the Fundamental Duties:
Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971:
Disrespecting the National flag, the Constitution of India, and the National Anthem is deemed unlawful under this act.
Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955:
This act provides legal provisions and punishments for offences related to caste and religion, safeguarding civil rights and promoting equality.
Representation of the People Act, 1951:
Members of Parliament or state legislatures indulging in corrupt practices, such as seeking votes in the name of religion, can be held accountable under this act, ensuring ethical conduct in elections.
Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972:
Promotes conservation efforts and preserving biodiversity.
Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980:
Implemented to ensure the proper implementation of Article 51A(g).
Background of the case
The top court was hearing a plea filed by lawyer Durga Dutt which sought direction to the Centre for enacting well defined laws/rules to
ensure adherence to the fundamental duties as enshrined in the Constitution
The plea also stressed that non-adherence to Fundamental Duties impacts
Articles 14, 19, and 21
, and called for the creation of schemes incentivizing citizens to follow these duties.
Additionally, it sought guidelines from the Centre and states to raise public awareness and encourage compliance with these duties.
Observations made by the Attorney General of India
He emphasized that effectuation of FD is a
He noted that the judiciary should refrain from directing the legislature to enact laws, especially when such matters are under legislative consideration.
He highlighted that the judiciary, including the Supreme Court, has consistently recognized the importance of Fundamental Duties in interpreting constitutional matters and imposing a social obligation on citizens.
However, he also pointed out that
Fundamental Duties are non-justiciable
and that their implementation lies primarily with the
executive
He referenced a
1998 committee
constituted by the Centre to teach and operationalize Fundamental Duties.
The Attorney General argued that incorporating these duties in
is insufficient without active efforts from the government, particularly in
education and culture
He urged the court to acknowledge the steps already taken and to
close the case
with appropriate directions.

Complementary Systems
: Germany’s
Eurofighter and its future replacement by U.S.-made F-35s
highlight Germany’s readiness to integrate its defence systems with Western platforms, easing potential interoperability issues for India.
Exercise Tarang Shakti:
is one of the most extensive
multilateral air exercises hosted by the Indian Air Force (IAF),
showcasing India’s commitment to international defence cooperation.
This exercise marked the
first time the German Luftwaffe (Air Force)
participated in air sorties over Indian skies,
symbolizing Germany’s growing defence ties with India.
It would become a
biennial exercise,
highlighting India’s intent to make such
multinational military cooperation a regular feature.
Tarang Shakti was seen as a tryout for the larger
Pacific Skies 24 air exercise involving France, Germany, and Spain
, further emphasizing the Indo-Pacific’s growing military relevance.
Present Dilemma of China:
Germany’s Strategic Interest in the Indo-Pacific
: China’s aggressive actions, such as building artificial islands in the South China Sea, pose a significant threat to regional stability,
international shipping, and trade routes
, which Germany heavily depends on.
Germany’s Balancing Act
: While Germany has clear political positions against China’s actions in the Indo-Pacific, its
economic dependence on China complicates the situation
. Germany’s increasing defence presence in the region is partly aimed at ensuring free and secure shipping routes.
Europe’s Shift in Focus
: Post Russia-Ukraine war, Europe, including Germany, is r
ecalibrating its foreign policy towards the Indo-Pacific, recognizing the region as the future centre of global economic and geopolitical influence,
which is driving greater German defence engagement in the region.
Way Forward:
Enhance Defence Collaboration
: India and Germany should focus on deepening defense cooperation, particularly in areas like technology transfer, joint military exercises, and advanced systems integration to build long-term strategic partnerships.
Strengthen Indo-Pacific Engagement
: Germany and India should align their Indo-Pacific strategies to ensure regional stability, emphasizing free trade routes and countering China’s assertiveness while balancing economic dependencies.
Mains PYQ:
To what extent can Germany be held responsible for causing the two World Wars? Discuss critically.
