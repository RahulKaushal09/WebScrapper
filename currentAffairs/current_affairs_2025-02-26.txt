Palaeognath Birds
A new study by scientists from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom has found that Palaeognath Birds like Emus and rheas are not exactly ‘dumb’ as assumed to be.
About Palaeognath Birds:
These are grouped together on the basis of their
distinctive palate morphology
, from which they receive their name ("old jaw").
Most of the birds classified in the
Palaeognathae are also flightless
, but not all flightless birds are classified in the Palaeognathae.
These 50 bird species are very different from the other birds on the planet.
They are the
largest and heaviest avian specimens
on Earth and may represent some of the first birds to evolve from dinosaurs.
These birds are
classified into two groups:
Tinamiformes:
These species have a keeled
sternum and can fly
(weakly), which include the tinamous of South and Central America; and the
Ratitae, or ratite birds:
They have flat sterna and reduced wings, and
cannot fly at all.
Examples:
The African ostrich, the rhea of South America the Australian emu and New Guinea cassowary; and the kiwi of New Zealand.

It provides a
quicker and cost-effective
alternative to traditional public offerings (IPOs and FPOs) while
ensuring minimal dilution of management control.
Why was QIP introduced in India?
Earlier
, since raising finance in the domestic market involved a lot of complications,
Indian companies used to raise funds from the overseas markets.
So to prevent this,
SEBI in 2006 introduced the QIP
process so as to m
ake the raising of funds easier in the domestic market.
QIP allows companies to raise funds domestically,

**********High Court's Verdict on Nighttime Arrests of Women
Why in news?
The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court ruled that the provision in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, restricting the arrest of women at night is directory, not mandatory.
While a single Judge deemed an 8 PM arrest a violation of Section 46(4) of the CrPC, a two-Judge Bench later held that the provision was not absolute.
What’s in today’s article?
Safeguards for Arresting Women at Night
Madras High Court’s Ruling on Section 46(4) of CrPC
Section 46(4) of CrPC – Background
Supreme Court’s View on Arresting Women at Night
Two safeguards are provided under
Section 43(5) of BNSS
(which corresponds to Section
) for the arrest of a woman by the police.
Restriction on Arrest Timing
No arrest of a woman shall be made after sunset and before sunrise, except in exceptional circumstances.
Magistrate’s Permission Requirement
In exceptional circumstances, a woman police officer must obtain prior written permission from the jurisdictional magistrate before making the arrest.
Protection Against Physical Contact
The arresting officer must not touch the woman unless it is a woman police officer or circumstances require it.
Lack of Definition for ‘Exceptional Circumstances’
Section 46(4) of CrPC ensures the safety of women
but does not explicitly define what qualifies as an exceptional situation
, leading to ambiguity in its application.
Non-Mandatory Nature of the Provision
The Court observed that Section 46(4) of CrPC does not specify consequences for non-compliance, indicating that it is directory, not mandatory.
Public Duty of Police Officers
Arresting officers perform a public duty, and strict adherence to procedure should not hinder law enforcement.
Practical Challenges in Heinous Cases
In cases of serious crimes committed by women at night, immediate arrest may be necessary, especially if a magistrate is unavailable.
Delayed action could lead to the accused escaping, which may compromise public interest.
Section 46(4) of CrPC - Background
135th Law Commission Report (1989)
Recommended that women should not be arrested after sunset and before sunrise.
In exceptional cases, prior permission from the immediate superior officer was required.
In urgent cases, an arrest report with reasons had to be submitted to the superior officer and the magistrate.
154th Law Commission Report (1996)
Reaffirmed the recommendations of the 135th report regarding the arrest of women.
Incorporation into CrPC (2005)
Based on these recommendations, Section 46(4) was added to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) with modifications to enhance safeguards for women.
Earlier, the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court directed that no woman should be detained without a lady constable and never after sunset or before sunrise.
The Supreme Court noted that strict adherence to this rule might cause practical difficulties in certain situations.
Impact of the Madras HC Ruling
Provision is Directory, Not Mandatory
The Court clarified that Section 46(4) of CrPC/43(5) of BNSS is directory, meaning non-compliance does not automatically make an arrest illegal.
Obligation to Justify Non-Compliance
While failure to follow the provision does not invalidate an arrest, the arresting officer must provide a valid explanation for not complying with the safeguards.
Need for Clear Guidelines
The Court directed police authorities to issue guidelines defining what constitutes “exceptional circumstances” to ensure the provision is not misused or ignored.

**********What are Dwarf Galaxies?
A team of scientists in the US, led by Indian-origin astrophysicist Raga Deepika Pucha, recently discovered the largest samples of intermediate-mass black holes and dwarf galaxies with active black holes.
About Dwarf Galaxies:
They are
small galaxies
that typically contain just a
few billion stars
, unlike
their larger cousins
, which can
hold hundreds of billions.
They are the
most abundant type of galaxy
in the universe but are
difficult to detect
due to their l
ow luminosity, low mass,
small size.
They are most commonly
found in galaxy clusters
, often as
companions to larger galaxies.
Our Milky Way galaxy is orbited by more than 20 dwarf galaxies.
They are thought to have been
created by gravitational forces
in the early stages of the creation of these larger galaxies,
or as a result of collisions between galaxies,
forming from streams of material and dark matter ejected from the parent galaxies.
Because most of them come from galaxy collisions, many dwarf galaxies are
grouped into irregular shapes.
However,
some dwarf galaxies
have spiral arms or
look like mini-elliptical galaxies.

**********Time Use Survey 2024
Why in the News?
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has released the 2
edition of the Time Use Survey.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Time Use Survey (Objectives, Key Findings, Implications, Future Outlook, etc.)
Introduction:
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) recently released the
Time Use Survey (TUS) 2024
, highlighting significant trends in
how Indians allocate their time to various activities, including employment, caregiving, and leisure
The National Statistics Office (NSO), MoSPI conducted the first all-India Time Use Survey during January – December 2019.
The present TUS conducted during January – December 2024 is the second such All-India Survey.
A key takeaway from the report is the
increase in women’s participation in employment-related activities
, signalling a gradual shift from unpaid domestic work to paid jobs.
This transformation is a crucial development in India’s labor market dynamics, reflecting economic and social changes.
Key Findings of Time Use Survey 2024:
Rise in Workforce Participation
The participation of women in employment-related activities has increased from
21.8% in 2019 to 25% in 2024
For men, the figure has risen from
70
9% to 75%
This data reflects an expanding economic role for women, although the gender gap in labor participation remains substantial.
Decline in Time Spent on Unpaid Domestic Work
Women spent
305 minutes per day
on unpaid domestic services in 2024, compared to
315 minutes in 2019
, indicating a transition toward paid work.
Male members spent significantly less time on such tasks, averaging
88 minutes per day
Women’s Role in Caregiving
41% of women aged 15-59
participated in caregiving activities, compared to only
4% of men
in the same age group.
137 minutes per day
in caregiving, nearly double the
75 minutes spent by men
These figures highlight the continued burden of unpaid caregiving on women despite an increase in their economic participation.
Implications of the Changing Work Dynamics:
Economic Impact
The shift of women from unpaid domestic duties to paid jobs has economic benefits, including:
Higher household incomes:
Additional earnings from female members contribute to family well-being
Enhanced productivity:
More women in the workforce can drive economic growth.
Formalization of labor:
More women entering paid jobs can lead to increased labor formalization and social security benefits.
Social and Policy Implications
Despite progress, gender disparities in workforce participation persist. The findings highlight the need for:
Skill Development Programs:
To help women transition into better-paying jobs.
Flexible Work Policies:
Including remote work and part-time options to balance professional and domestic responsibilities.
Government Support:
Policies like maternity benefits, affordable childcare, and financial incentives to encourage female workforce participation.
Leisure and Cultural Activities:
People aged 6 and above
171 minutes per day
on cultural, leisure, and mass-media activities.
Men spent slightly more time on these activities (
177 minutes
) than women (
164 minutes
), reflecting the gendered division of time.
Education and Self-Care:
89.3% of children aged 6-14
participated in learning activities, spending around
413 minutes per day
on studies.
Self-care and maintenance
accounted for an average of
708 minutes per day
across all age groups.
Future Outlook and Recommendations:
Strengthening Skill Training:
Expanding vocational training programs for women in sectors like IT, healthcare, and entrepreneurship.
Creating More Job Opportunities:
Encouraging industries to hire more women through affirmative action.
Enhancing Social Security Benefits:
Strengthening maternity benefits, pension schemes, and workplace protections for female workers.
Workplace Inclusivity Initiatives:
Promoting gender-sensitive policies in both urban and rural employment sectors.
Conclusion:
underscores a positive shift toward greater female workforce participation in India. While progress has been made, gender disparities remain, necessitating
policy interventions, skill development, and supportive work environments
to ensure that more women can transition from unpaid domestic work to meaningful employment.
A continued focus on gender equity in employment will play a crucial role in
India’s economic growth and social progress

**********Ursula von der Leyen’s Visit to India - Revitalizing India-EU Strategic Partnership
Context:
The visit of
European Commission President
Ursula von der Leyen to India, along with the entire College of Commissioners (the European Cabinet), marks a significant moment in the
evolving India-EU relationship
.
This visit gains additional importance against the
backdrop of Donald Trump’s
return to the White House, which has introduced
fresh uncertainties in global geopolitics
Geopolitical Context - The Trump Factor
Trump’s policies are
reshaping U.S. relations
with Russia, China, and Europe.
His approach
prioritizes bilateral deals
over multilateral commitments.
Trump’s stance on
Ukraine and NATO
has left European nations in a vulnerable position.
For example
, Trump’s withdrawal of support for Ukraine has shocked Europe.
His administration demands that
European nations take full responsibility for their security.
Washington’s ideological shift
, including support for right-wing European parties (for example, Germany’s Alternative for Germany [AfD]), is
reshaping internal EU politics
India’s Strategic Calculations:
India has historically managed global power shifts by
engaging with multiple partners
For example,
India’s strategy (until now) for managing US policy volatility has involved maintaining its ties with Russia and engaging in Moscow-led coalitions such as BRICS.
This means, India traditionally relied on
balancing
ties with Russia and the US.
With Russia seeking direct negotiations with the U.S.,
India must broaden its strategic partnerships
and recalibrate its strategy amid shifting alliances.
Europe emerges as a key player
in India’s evolving foreign policy framework.
India-EU Relations:
A historical perspective:
A strategic partnership
was declared in
2004
but lost momentum by the early 2010s.
Trade negotiations had stalled, and
Brussels prioritized commercial ties with China
India revived engagement in
2016
, leading to increased cooperation post-pandemic.
Key initiatives include:
India-EU Trade and Technology Council
India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)
Strengthened Indo-Pacific engagement
Economic realities and challenges:
India’s economic engagement with the EU remains
underdeveloped
despite clear synergies.
India’s trade deficit with China
continues to widen, nearing $100 billion annually.
The global economic order, once assumed to be stable/irreversible, is being dismantled by Trump’s policies.
India must push for economic reforms and
reduce dependence on Chinese imports.
Key Takeaways from Von der Leyen’s Visit:
The visit provides Delhi with the perfect
opportunity to revitalise
its engagement with the EU -
the world’s third-largest economy
after the US and China.
Strategic convergence
between India and Europe can mitigate risks from U.S. unpredictability.
A Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
and increased bilateral trade remain priority areas.
As the EU is a vital source of science, technology, advanced industry, capital, and a vast consumer market,
strengthening cooperation
in these areas is essential for India’s economic resilience.
Way Ahead Towards Strengthening India-EU Ties:
Despite their traditional emphasis on “strategic autonomy,” both Brussels and Delhi have
long relied on their partnerships with the US
as the anchor of their global strategies.
While
neither can afford to disengage
from the US,
both India and Europe must now do more to strengthen their ties
in response to Trump’s unpredictable policies.
As India
recognised Europe’s strategic value
in a multipolar world, the EU also moved to “
de-risk
” its economic ties with China and increase its engagement in the
Indo-Pacific region.
Conclusion:
The changing global order demands
a recalibrated Indian foreign policy.
With Europe actively seeking to reduce economic dependence on China and India looking to diversify strategic partnerships, Ursula von der Leyen’s visit presents a timely opportunity to
solidify India-EU ties.
Strengthening this partnership will
enhance India’s role in an increasingly multipolar world
while ensuring economic and strategic stability.

**********AI Has an Environmental Problem
Context
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
has become an
indispensable force in modern society
, revolutionising industries, economies, and daily life.
With recent advancements in computing power and data availability,
AI adoption has surged, driving economic value at an unprecedented scale.
The
global AI market, currently valued at $200 billion
, is projected to contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.
However,
while AI offers immense economic potential, its rapid expansion also raises critical concerns,
particularly regarding its environmental footprint.
AI’s Environmental Impact Across Stages
Hardware Production and Infrastructure
Raw Material Extraction and Manufacturing
The manufacturing of
AI hardware requires rare earth metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel
, which are mined under environmentally damaging conditions.
Mining operations contribute to deforestation
, habitat destruction, and significant carbon emissions.
Additionally,
the extraction of these materials often involves unethical labour practices
in some regions.
Energy-Intensive Production
fabrication of semiconductors
and other AI hardware
involves complex chemical processes and high-temperature treatments
, consuming vast amounts of energy.
semiconductor industry alone
accounts for a notable share
of global industrial emissions.
E-Waste Crisis
As AI-driven systems demand more computing power,
the lifecycle of AI hardware shortens
, contributing to a
growing electronic waste (e-waste) problem.
Many GPUs and TPUs become obsolete
within a few years, leading to discarded electronic components that contain
hazardous substances like lead, mercury, and cadmium,
which pollute the environment when not properly recycled.
Data Centre Operations: The Backbone of AI
Energy Consumption
Data centres are
responsible for approximately 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions,
according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
This
figure is expected to double by 2026
as AI applications become more widespread.
AI models
, particularly generative AI models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek,
require significantly higher computing power
than traditional algorithms,
further escalating energy demand.
Water Usage for Cooling
data centres generate immense heat
due to their continuous operations, necessitating efficient cooling systems.
large-scale data centres rely on water-based cooling systems
, which consume millions of litres of water annually.
exacerbates water scarcity in regions
where such facilities are located.
Location-Based Carbon Footprint
The environmental impact of data centres is
also influenced by their geographical location.
Data centres in regions
powered by coal and fossil fuels have a much higher carbon footprint
than those situated in areas using renewable energy.
Companies that fail to strategically place their infrastructure contribute more to global emissions.
AI Model Life Cycle Emissions
Training AI Models
Training state-of-the-art AI models is
an extremely energy-intensive process.
For instance,
GPT-3’s training process emitted approximately 552 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂-e),
comparable to the emissions from nearly 125 gasoline-powered cars over a year.
Advanced models like
GPT-4 require even more computational resources
, escalating their environmental impact.
Inferencing and Continuous Operation
Once AI models are deployed, they
require substantial computational power to process user queries
and make real-time predictions.
This is known as inferencing
, which can sometimes consume 10–100 times more energy than earlier AI models.
Since these models run continuously on cloud servers,
their energy consumption compounds over time.
Data Storage and Retrieval
rely on massive datasets that require ongoing storage and retrieval
, further increasing energy usage.
Maintaining these vast datasets i
nvolves constant processing and updating, which contributes to sustained power consumption.
Model Retirement and Re-training
Unlike traditional software that can run for years with periodic updates,
AI models often require retraining as new data becomes available.
Each retraining cycle demands significant computational resources
, leading to recurring carbon emissions.
The Global Response to AI’s Environmental Challenges
As awareness of AI’s environmental impact grows,
global discussions on sustainable AI practices have gained momentum.
At COP29, the
International Telecommunication Union emphasised the need for greener AI solutions,
urging businesses and governments to integrate sustainability into their AI strategies.
More than 190 countries have adopted ethical AI recommendations
that address environmental concerns, and legislative efforts in the European Union and the U.S. aim to curb AI’s carbon footprint.
However, despite these initiatives,
concrete policies remain scarce.
Many national AI strategies primarily focus on economic growth
and technological innovation, often
overlooking the role of the private sector in reducing emissions.
Strategies for Sustainable AI Development
Need to Strike a Balance
Achieving a balance
between AI-driven innovation and environmental responsibility
requires a multi-faceted approach.
A key step in this direction is
investing in clean energy sources
. Companies can reduce AI’s carbon footprint by transitioning to renewable energy and purchasing carbon credits to offset emissions.
, locating data centres in regions with abundant renewable resources can help alleviate energy strain
and minimise environmental damage.
AI itself can contribute to sustainability by optimizing energy grids.
Google’s DeepMind has successfully applied machine learning to improve wind energy forecasting,
enabling better integration of wind power into the electricity grid.
Hardware Efficiency
Hardware efficiency is another critical factor in reducing AI’s environmental impact.
development of energy-efficient computing components
and regular maintenance of hardware
can significantly lower emissions.
Moreover,
optimising AI models can lead to substantial energy savings
. Smaller, domain-specific models designed for particular applications require less computational power while delivering comparable results.
Research suggests that the
carbon footprint of large language models (LLMs) can be reduced by a factor of 100 to 1,000 through algorithmic optimisation,
specialized hardware, and energy-efficient cloud computing.
Businesses can also reduce resource consumption by
adapting pre-trained models
rather than training new models from scratch.
Transparency and Accountability
Transparency and accountability are
essential to driving sustainability efforts.
Organisations
must measure and disclose the environmental impact of their AI systems
to gain a comprehensive understanding of life cycle emissions.
Establishing standardised frameworks for tracking and comparing emissions across the AI industry will promote consistency
and encourage companies to adopt greener practices.
Conclusion
Sustainability must be embedded into the core design of AI ecosystems
to ensure their long-term viability.
While AI presents groundbreaking opportunities for economic growth and technological progress,
it is crucial to address the environmental costs associated with its expansion
By investing in renewable energy,
optimising hardware and software efficiency, and developing transparency in emissions tracking, we can achieve a sustainable AI future.

Editorial Analysis
**********Human Smuggling Must Engage Parliament’s Attention
Context
Human smuggling remains a grave humanitarian crisis
affecting thousands of Indians who seek better opportunities abroad through illegal channels.
The
loopholes of existing legal frameworks, particularly the Emigration Act, 1983 and the Punjab Travel Professionals Regulation Act, 2012,
highlights the inefficiencies in tackling this growing menace.
Therefore,
it is crucial to explore the socio-economic factors behind irregular migration, the exploitative nature of human smuggling networks
, the existing legislative gaps, and the need for a robust national legal framework.
The Dark Reality of Human Smuggling
The Role of Human Smugglers: Preying on Desperation
The illegal migration network is a
well-organised system involving travel agents
, document forgers, corrupt officials, and international criminal syndicates.
These
smugglers operate openly in rural India
, targeting vulnerable individuals and their families with false promises.
They
charge exorbitant sums, often several lakhs of rupees,
under the pretext of securing visas, work permits, or direct job placements.
Many families sell their land, jewellery, or take massive loans
to fund these journeys, believing that their loved ones will achieve prosperity abroad.
However,
once these migrants leave India, their nightmare begins.
Many are
sent through dangerous routes, including forests, deserts, or even war zones.
Some are crammed into overcrowded boats,
hidden inside trucks, or locked inside shipping containers for days without food or water.
significant number do not survive the journey
, dying from suffocation, dehydration, or drowning.
The Inhumane Conditions Faced by Migrants
For those who do make it to their destination
, the suffering continues.
Without proper documentation, they are at the mercy of traffickers
and employers who treat them as modern-day slaves. Many are forced into:
Backbreaking, unpaid labour
on construction sites, farms, or factories.
Sex trafficking and forced prostitution
, especially in the case of women and young girls.
Working under extreme conditions in war-torn regions
, such as clearing ammunition fields in Iraq.
Detention and deportation, often in shackles
, after being caught by immigration authorities.
Survivors have narrated horrific accounts of their journeys.
Some were made to sit in piles of human waste, while others watched fellow migrants die
beside them, their bodies dumped on roadsides or into the ocean.
Many end up stranded, with no legal rights, no money, and no way to return home.
The Psychological and Social Toll
Beyond the physical dangers,
illegal migration leaves deep psychological scars.
Migrants who return after being deported face humiliation, shame, and economic ruin.
Families who invested their life savings
in these journeys are
often left in debt traps,
struggling to recover financially.
The stigma surrounding failed migration leads to social isolation, and in extreme cases, some returnees even resort to suicide.
The Globalization of Human Smuggling
smuggling of migrants is no longer just an issue of small-scale fraud
; it has evolved into a globalised criminal enterprise.
International mafias and trafficking syndicates coordinate across borders,
using fake documents, underground transport networks, and bribery to move people illegally.
Due to low detection rates and weak legal frameworks, smuggling has become an extremely profitable
and low-risk business for criminals.
Gaps in Existing Laws
Challenges in Law Enforcement
The Emigration Act, 1983: An Outdated and Ineffective Law
The law was enacted to regulate the movement of Indian citizens abroad, particularly for employment purposes.
It sought to prevent
exploitation of Indian workers in foreign countries
by introducing a system of emigration clearance for those traveling to specific countries. However, the law is
outdated and ineffective
in the following ways:
Failure to Define Human Smuggling
The Act
does not define or criminalize human smuggling
, leaving a massive legal loophole that allows traffickers to operate freely.
Since human smuggling is not explicitly recognized as a crime, law enforcement agencies
lack the legal authority
to take strict action against offenders.
Weak Regulation of Recruitment Agents
The law primarily focuses on
licensing recruitment agents
who facilitate legal overseas employment but does not address
illegal travel agents
and human traffickers.
Many travel agents
operate without licenses
and deceive vulnerable individuals with
fake job offers, forged visas, and false promises
Lack of Stringent Punishment
The penalties under the Act are
too lenient
to deter criminal networks. Smugglers often
escape with minor fines or short prison sentences
, allowing them to resume operations quickly.
Organised crime syndicates find it
more profitable to continue smuggling people
, as the financial rewards far outweigh the legal consequences.
The Punjab Travel Professionals Regulation Act, 2012: A Limited Effort
Recognising the rampant problem of human smuggling in the state, Punjab enacted the
to regulate the activities of travel agents and prevent
fraudulent migration schemes
While this law is a
step in the right direction
, it remains
limited in scope and enforcement
due to several reasons:
Limited to Punjab
The law applies
only within the state of Punjab
, leaving smugglers in other parts of India
free to continue their operations
without fear of prosecution.
Since human smuggling is a
national and international problem
state-level law is insufficient
to combat it effectively.
Poor Implementation and Weak Enforcement
Despite the law’s existence,
illegal travel agents continue to flourish
in Punjab due to
poor enforcement
Many smugglers operate under
different names and fake identities
to evade detection.
Corruption within local authorities
enables illegal agents to continue their businesses
without facing any real consequences.
Lack of Coordination with Central Authorities
Since the law is limited to Punjab, it
does not integrate with national agencies
such as the
Bureau of Immigration (BoI)
or the
Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)
This lack of coordination
prevents effective tracking and prosecution of smugglers operating across multiple states
The Way Ahead to Fix the Gaps and Address the Challenges: A National Call to Action
Legislative Reforms
strong national law
must be enacted to define human smuggling, impose strict penalties on offenders, and protect vulnerable migrants.
Strict Law Enforcement
: Authorities must
crack down on illegal agents
and international crime syndicates involved in smuggling operations.
Awareness Campaigns
: Young individuals must be educated about the
dangers of illegal immigration
and the legal alternatives available.
International Cooperation
: India must collaborate with destination countries to
prevent illegal entry, rescue victims, and repatriate stranded migrants
Employment Opportunities
: Creating better job prospects within India can
deter migration
and reduce the demand for illegal routes.
Conclusion
Human smuggling is a
grave violation of human rights
that demands immediate attention.
The existing
legal and enforcement mechanisms are insufficient
, and Parliament must step up to enact a
comprehensive, enforceable law
to safeguard Indian citizens.
Without urgent action, countless more lives will be lost to this ruthless trade. The time for
legislative inertia is over
, India must rise to protect its people from the perils of human smuggling.

Editorial Analysis
**********[26th February 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: The right’s rise, Europe’s state of denial
International Relations
PYQ Relevance:
) What is the significance of Indo-US defence deals over Indo-Russian defence deals? Discuss with reference to stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
(UPSC CSE 2020)
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on
“ Indo-US defence deals over Indo-Russian defence deals”  (2020),
and the “
Russia and Ukraine war”
(2022).
In February 2025, the U.S. blamed Ukraine, Germany, and other European countries for not doing enough to end the conflict and for continuing a war with Russia that it sees as unwinnable. However, the U.S. itself has already spent over $110 billion on the Ukraine war, including $65 billion on ammunition—more than what major Western countries combined have provided.
Today’s editorial highlights the double stance of the USA in international relations. This content would help in GS paper 2 (IR).
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
The Munich Security Conference in Germany and the recent United Nations General Assembly vote on Ukraine were filled with contradictions and hypocrisy.
What were the key contradictions during the Munich Security Conference and the UN General Assembly vote on Ukraine?
U.S. Criticism of European Democratic Practices vs. Its Own Actions:
U.S. Vice-President J.D. Vance accused Europe of suppressing right-wing parties and curbing free speech. However, the U.S. previously sought to delegitimize its own right-wing movements including the 2021 Capitol riot and Trump’s 2020 election denial further exposed this contradiction.
U.S. Demand for European Security Responsibility vs. Past Opposition:
The U.S. urged Europe to increase defense spending and reduce reliance on NATO. Yet, since the Cold War’s end the U.S. has consistently opposed European efforts to establish independent security frameworks fearing a weakened NATO.
UN General Assembly vote on Ukraine:
U.S. Opposition to European-Ukrainian Resolution vs. Its Previous Support:
Despite previously leading international efforts to support Ukraine against Russia and now the U.S. voted
against a European-Ukrainian draft resolution. This contradicts its long-standing position of backing Ukraine and opposing Russian aggression.
Europe’s Victory Without U.S. Support:
The European-Ukrainian resolution was adopted despite U.S. opposition, highlighting a
growing divide
between American and European approaches to the Ukraine conflict. However, without sustained U.S. support, Europe’s ability to continue aiding Ukraine effectively is uncertain, making the victory largely symbolic.
How has the U.S.’s stance on the Ukraine war shifted over time?
Initial Strong Support for Ukraine (2022-2023):
The U.S. led global efforts to support Ukraine, providing
$65 billion for ammunition
, and coordinated sanctions against Russia. Example: The U.S. played a key role in mobilizing NATO allies to send advanced weaponry, including Germany’s Leopard tanks.
Undermining Peace Negotiations (2022):
The U.S. discouraged early peace talks between
in Türkiye, preferring to prolong the conflict to weaken Russia strategically. Example: In
March 2022
, a European leader, reportedly at U.S. behest, sabotaged a nearly finalized peace agreement.
Tensions with European Allies (2023-2024):
The U.S. increasingly criticized Europe for
not contributing enough
financially and militarily while maintaining disproportionate U.S. involvement. Example: Despite urging Europe to take responsibility, the U.S. continued to dominate
NATO’s budget (16%)
and military commitments.
Shifting Blame to Europe (2025):
By
, the U.S. accused
Germany, Ukraine, and other European nations
of pursuing an unwinnable war and not doing enough to seek a resolution.
Voting Against European-Ukrainian Resolution (2025):
In a dramatic reversal, the U.S. voted
against a European-Ukrainian draft at the
, signaling a shift toward
disengagement
. This marked a break from the U.S.’s previous unconditional support and exposed widening trans-Atlantic rifts over Ukraine policy.
Why is the trans-Atlantic partnership between the U.S. and Europe still considered relevant?
Shared Security Commitments Through NATO:
The U.S. and Europe continue to rely on
for collective defence, especially in response to
and emerging global threats. Example: After
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (2022)
, the U.S. increased its troop presence in Eastern Europe, while
Finland and Sweden
joined NATO, reinforcing trans-Atlantic security ties.
Economic and Technological Interdependence:
The U.S. and Europe maintain deep economic ties through
trade, technology collaboration
, and joint efforts on
climate change
supply chain resilience
U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC)
fosters cooperation on critical areas like
semiconductors
clean energy
, reducing dependence on China.
What lessons should India learn from the USA’s constantly changing policies?
Need for Policy Consistency and Strategic Autonomy:
Frequent shifts in U.S. foreign policy highlight the importance of maintaining
stable and long-term strategies
to protect national interests.
Example: The U.S.’s fluctuating stance on
Afghanistan
shows how unpredictable alliances can be. India should continue pursuing
strategic autonomy
through initiatives like
“Act East”
and partnerships with
Russia and the Global South
to avoid over-reliance on any one nation.
Diversification of Economic and Defense Partnerships:
Rapid policy changes in the U.S. underscore the need to
diversify
partnerships to reduce vulnerability to external shocks.
Example: U.S. sanctions on
Iran
disrupted India’s oil imports. In response, India diversified its energy sources by strengthening ties with
and exploring
renewable energy
investments.
Investing in Domestic Capabilities:
India must strengthen its
domestic manufacturing, technology
defense industries
to reduce dependence on unpredictable foreign partners.
Example: The U.S.’s evolving position on
export controls
for advanced technologies emphasizes the need for India to accelerate initiatives like
“Make in India”
semiconductor manufacturing
to ensure technological sovereignty.
Way forward:
Strengthen Strategic Autonomy:
Prioritize independent foreign policy decisions while balancing ties with major powers. Enhance regional leadership through initiatives like
“Neighborhood First”
to reduce reliance on any single partner.
Enhance Self-Reliance and Diversification:
Invest in domestic capabilities through programs like
“Digital India”
, while diversifying economic and defence partnerships to mitigate risks from external policy shifts.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Education Policy; Issues related to language;
Why in the News?
The Central government and the Tamil Nadu government are disagreeing over the three-language rule in schools under the New Education Policy (NEP), 2020.
Why is the Union government withholding funds under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan from Tamil Nadu?
Non-compliance with the three-language formula
: The Union government has linked the release of funds under the
to the implementation of the three-language formula outlined in the
National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
. Tamil Nadu’s refusal to adopt this formula has led to a standoff.
Policy disagreement
: The Tamil Nadu government views the three-language policy as a tool for
Hindi imposition
and insists on continuing with its
two-language policy
(Tamil and English).
Financial leverage
: The Centre is using
financial incentives
to push for uniform adoption of the NEP guidelines across States, causing friction with Tamil Nadu.
When was the three-language policy first introduced, and what were its key mandates?
was first introduced in the
National Policy on Education (NPE), 1968
to promote multilingualism and foster national unity.
Key Mandates of the Three-Language Policy:
First Language – Mother Tongue/Regional Language:
Students must learn their
mother tongue
or the
regional language
of the state. Example:
Kannada
is the first language in
Karnataka
, while
Second Language – Hindi or English:
In
Hindi-speaking states
, students must learn

as a third language in
Madhya Pradesh
is the third language in
What difficulties do government schools face in implementing additional language courses?
Shortage of Qualified Language Teachers:
Many government schools
lack trained teachers
for third-language instruction. Example: In
rural Odisha
, schools often struggle to find Hindi teachers, affecting the implementation of the three-language formula.
Limited Resources and Infrastructure:
Schools
lack textbooks, teaching aids, and language labs
, making it difficult to provide quality language education. Example: Government schools in
Bihar
face a
shortage of English textbooks
, leading to poor learning outcomes.
Burden on Students and Poor Learning Outcomes:
Many students struggle to
grasp multiple languages simultaneously
, especially those from economically weaker backgrounds. Example: In
, students from rural areas find it difficult to learn Hindi as a third language due to
limited exposure
and practice opportunities.
What are the basic issues in Schools?
ASER 2022 found

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Madhya Pradesh CM released
10 gharials
into the
Chambal River
at the
National Chambal Gharial Sanctuary
Morena
.
About Gharial
The
gharial (
Gavialis gangeticus
)
is a unique species of crocodilian, characterized by its
long, slender snout
, which is perfectly adapted for catching fish.
The species derives its name from the
“ghara”
, a bulbous growth found on the
snouts of adult males
, which aids in vocalization and mating displays.
It is a
fish-eating crocodile
native to the Indian subcontinent.
They are a crucial
indicator of clean river
water.
Conservation Status:
Recognizing the rapid decline in gharial populations,
India launched captive breeding and release programs
in the late
1970s
Between
1975 and 1982
, the country established
16 captive breeding centers
5 protected sanctuaries
to ensure the survival of the species.
Gharials are ‘
Critically Endangered’
IUCN Red List
of Species.
The species is also listed under
Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972
Today, gharials primarily survive in
5 major refuges
National Chambal Sanctuary (NCS)
– The largest stronghold of gharials.
Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary
in Uttar Pradesh.
Chitwan National Park
in Nepal.
Son River Sanctuary
in Madhya Pradesh.
Satkosia Gorge Sanctuary
in Odisha.

**********What is Black Plastic?
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
A
recent study
suggested that black plastic contains
harmful flame retardants
, which may
leach into food
hazardous levels
.
Black plastic is often
made from recycled electronic waste
like
old computers, TVs, and appliances
These electronics contain
(such as bromine-based compounds),
heavy metals
(lead, cadmium, mercury), and
other hazardous chemicals
Flame retardants
are added to
prevent fire hazards
, but they can persist in recycled plastics.
Many of these chemicals are
now banned in several countries
due to their
toxicity
However,
legacy plastics containing these substances
continue to
enter the recycling stream
, leading to contamination of household products.
Threats Posed by Black Plastic:
Contains Toxic Chemicals:
Made from recycled e-waste, it may have
flame retardants, heavy metals, and antimony
Food Contamination
: Heat and acidic foods can
leach harmful chemicals
into meals.
Environmental Impact:
Difficult to recycle
, it pollutes landfills and groundwater.
Health Risks:
Linked to
hormonal issues, neurological damage, and cancer

Why is there a great concern about the ‘microbeads’ that are released into environment?
(a) They are considered harmful to marine ecosystems.
(b) They are considered to cause skin cancer in children.
(c) They are small enough to be absorbed by crop plants in irrigated fields.
(d) They are often found to be used as food adulterants.
**********New Experiment to Test Quantum Gravity
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
A new proposal published on October 29, 2024, suggests an experiment that could provide
direct evidence for quantum gravity
, unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics. A new experiment proposes
testing weak gravitational fields
at the quantum level, a
historic breakthrough in physics
if successful.
What is Quantum Gravity?
Quantum Gravity is a
theoretical framework
that aims to
(which explains gravity at large scales) and
(which governs subatomic particles).
Since gravity behaves differently from the other fundamental forces in quantum mechanics, physicists have been searching for a
theory that integrates gravity into the quantum world
General relativity
treats gravity as the curvature of spacetime, while
describes forces through particle interactions.
Gravity has
never been directly observed in quantum form
, unlike the other fundamental forces.
Theories like
String Theory
Loop Quantum Gravity
attempt to explain quantum gravity but
lack experimental validation
Significance of the Experiment
First Realistic Test for Quantum Gravity
: Most quantum gravity theories rely on
extreme conditions
(e.g., black holes), making them
impossible to test
. This experiment provides a
lab-based alternative
Testing Gravity at the Quantum Level
: If a small mass in quantum superposition is influenced by gravity, it could prove
gravity itself is quantum in nature
Weak Gravity Instead of Strong Gravity
: Unlike previous studies focused on
, this experiment explores
weak gravitational interactions
, making it
more feasible
Towards a Unified Theory of Physics
: Proving quantum gravity could merge
, solving a
major gap in modern physics
Challenging Existing Theories
: If results differ from both
classical and quantum predictions
, it could suggest
a new force or a modified gravity theory
