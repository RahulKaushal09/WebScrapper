Why are India's Gaganyatris Going to the ISS?
Gaganyaan project (expected to be launched in 2025) envisages
demonstration of human spaceflight capability
by launching a crew of 4 members to an orbit of 400 km for a 3 days mission and bringing them back safely to earth.
It is part of the
Indian Human Spaceflight Programme (IHSP)
, which was initiated (2007) by the ISRO to develop the technology needed to launch crewed orbital spacecraft into low earth orbit (LEO).
Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3/GSLV Mk3) rocket
- the well proven and reliable heavy lift launcher of ISRO, is identified as the launch vehicle for Gaganyaan mission.
All systems in the LVM3 launch vehicle are re-configured to meet human rating requirements and christened
Human Rated LVM3/HLVM3
ISRO has thus far completed the pad abort and the high-altitude abort tests, and has tested the crew escape system.
The LVM-3 launch vehicle
for the mission has virtually completed the process of being rated to carry humans.
The crew module
is still being developed and it would have to be manufactured abroad.
Engineers were working on the capsule’s Environmental Control and Life Support System and the overall Integrated Vehicle Health Management System.
The next major Gaganyaan milestones are a series of
uncrewed suborbital and orbital test flights.
Background:
In 2023, the U.S. and India issued a joint statement after the Indian PM met the US President. The statement mentioned a joint effort to the ISS in 2024.
What is the ISS mission?
The mission called Axiom-4/ Ax-4
(which will last 14 days) is the fourth crewed mission to the ISS organised by Axiom Space - a private company based in Houston.
Axiom plans to operate the world’s first commercial space station.
As participants of the Ax-4 mission, Mr. Shukla/ Mr. Nair will fly to the ISS as the mission pilot along with three other astronauts.
SpaceX
will provide the launch vehicle for the mission and its Crew Dragon capsule will house the crew.
How are Gaganyatris selected for the mission?
According to ISRO, a
National Mission Assignment Board
selected Mr. Shukla and Mr. Nair for the joint mission.
Their flight to the ISS will need to be approved by the
Multilateral Crew Operations Panel,
which has representatives from the ISS’s five international partners:
NASA,
Russia’s Roscosmos,
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency,
The European Space Agency, and
The Canadian Space Agency.
Purpose of sending Gaganyatris on the mission:
The Gaganyatris will
undertake selected scientific research and technology demonstration
experiments on board the ISS as well as engage in space outreach activities.
The experiences gained during this mission will be
beneficial for Gaganyaan
and it will also
strengthen human space flight cooperation
between ISRO and NASA.”

**********Inside Hindenburg’s Claims SEBI Chief’s Alleged Conflicts of Interest
Why in News?
Hindenburg Research claims that the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) chairperson had a stake in unidentified offshore companies that were allegedly involved in "the Adani money syphoning scandal."
She (Madhabi Puri Buch) is in charge of probing allegations of malfeasance and stock price manipulation at the Adani group of companies flagged by Hindenburg Research 18 months ago.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is Hindenburg Research?
Hindenburg Research Report on the Adani Group in 2023
SEBI’s Investigation of the Adani Group
Hindenburg Research Report on SEBI
Looking the Issue from the Perspective of the ‘Conflict of Interest’
It is a US-based investment research firm
, founded by researcher Nathan Anderson in 2017.
The company was named after the Hindenburg disaster in 1937
, which was a man-made and avoidable explosion of a German airship.
The company specialises in forensic financial research
, conducting investigations and analyses on accounting irregularities, unethical business practices, and undisclosed financial issues or transactions.
Hindenburg Research Report on the Adani Group in 2023:
According to the report, Gautam Adani (the head of the Adani group) has
allegedly manipulated stock prices
in 7 key listed companies to add $100 billion to the group's valuation since 2020.
It alleged that
Rajesh Adani
(Gautam Adani's younger brother) had been arrested twice for forgery and tax fraud, but was promoted to managing director of the group.
According to the firm, Adani's elder brother (Vinod Adani) operated many
shell companies
, which were central to the claims of money laundering.
SEBI’s Investigation of the Adani Group:
The SEBI had launched investigations into transactions by the Adani group but the
probes did not go very far
According to the SEBI, Hindenburg Research had shared its findings on the Adani group with a New York-based hedge fund manager.
However, Hindenburg's research rejected SEBI's claims of sharing the report and called it
an attempt to silence those questioning corruption
by powerful entities in India.
The Supreme Court of India
ruled that they could not interfere in the SEBI's jurisdiction to investigate claims against Adani made in the Hindenburg report.
Hindenburg Research Report on SEBI:
The report claims the SEBI chief Madhabi Buch and her husband had stakes in offshore firms owned by Adani's elder brother.
These investments predate her appointment as a member of SEBI in 2017 and as chairperson in 2022.
Weeks before Buch’s appointment to SEBI in 2017, her husband took over sole control of their investments to avoid coming under the scanner.
The report suspects this reason for SEBI’s unwillingness to take meaningful action against alleged offshore shareholders in the Adani Group.
However, Madhabi Buch and her husband released a joint statement
denying all allegations against them.
Looking the Issue from the Perspective of the ‘Conflict of Interest’:
The opposition parties called on the central government to take immediate action
to eliminate all conflicts of interest
in the SEBI investigation of the Adani Group.
A conflict of interest
occurs when an individual’s personal interests - family, friendships, financial, or social factors - could compromise his or her judgement, decisions, or actions in the workplace.
It is always best to be
transparent and accountable
to eliminate either the perceived or actual conflict of interest.
Ways for dealing with conflicts of interest:
Establish a process:
That means imagining any potential conflict that may happen and deciding how it should be handled, who should be involved in dealing with it.
Get the conflict of interest out into the open.
Training is valuable:
In training sessions directors have the opportunity to become familiar with the terms, learn how to deal with conflicts and run through some scenarios.
Declare your interests.
In India
, the Companies Act 2013 states that directors must not involve themselves in situations where there is direct or indirect conflict with the company's interest.
The duties of the directors are to avoid not only the actual Conflict of Interest but also the potential Conflict of Interest.

**********Sheikh Hasina’s exit and impact on India
Why in news?
A week after protests in Bangladesh led to the ousting of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India, her future remains uncertain. The Indian government, under Narendra Modi, has provided her with refuge while simultaneously beginning to engage with the new regime that replaced her Awami League government. India is also assessing the impact these political changes in Bangladesh will have on its bilateral relations.
What’s in today’s article?
India – Bangladesh Relation during Hasina’s tenure
Can India Build Strong Relations with Bangladesh's New Leadership?
Sheikh Hasina's removal from power in Bangladesh marks a significant setback for India, given the strong bilateral ties forged over the past 15 years.
From her return to office (2009), Ms. Hasina made her intentions of strong ties with Delhi clear.
She began a nationwide crackdown to shut down terror camps, a campaign against religious radicalisation, and extradited over 20 most wanted men accused of terrorism and crime to India.
Hasina also worked on ending border tensions caused by illegal immigration into India, particularly the 2001 incident where brutal BDR-BSF clashes left 15 dead.
Several border patrolling agreements and the signing of the historic 2015 land boundary agreement followed.
India, in turn, supported Bangladesh through trade concessions, Lines of Credit, and various connectivity projects, helping transform the country’s economy.
The Manmohan Singh and Modi governments provided Bangladesh with trade concessions and low-interest Lines of Credit.
It supported Sheikh Hasina's efforts to transform the country from a struggling economy into a developing nation that surpassed its neighbors in human development indices.
Hasina's government, despite becoming increasingly authoritarian, maintained strong relations with India.
She stood with India on every issue, from boycotting SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) over terrorism from Pakistan, to the Citizenship Amendment Act that set off protests in Bangladesh.
Bangladesh has become crucial to India's regional connectivity plans and energy exports.
However, with her ouster, there is concern that many of the agreements and progress made, including recent power deals with the Adani group, may now be re-evaluated under the new regime.
India continues to engage with Bangladesh's interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, as demonstrated by the Indian High Commissioner's attendance at the swearing-in ceremony.
several challenges complicate India's relationship with the new regime
Firstly, Sheikh Hasina's presence in India is causing suspicion in Dhaka, and India may prefer her to leave India until tensions ease.
If the new government demands her extradition, it could create further complications.
Secondly, potential elections could bring the BNP to power, and India has had a difficult experience with the BNP government from 2001-2006, when Bangladesh harbored anti-India groups and aligned with China and Pakistan.
Lastly, PM Modi’s appeal for the safety of Hindus and minorities in Bangladesh, along with the establishment of a committee to ensure their protection, is being viewed as partisan in Dhaka, potentially straining relations further.
Impact on Bangladesh’s ties with other countries
The recent changes in Dhaka will likely affect Bangladesh's international relations, especially with the U.S., which has been critical of the Hasina government and may have played a role in her downfall.
The U.S. had implemented a special visa policy to promote democracy in Bangladesh, targeting Hasina and her party, so ties with the new government are expected to improve.
Relations with Pakistan, strained under Hasina, might also improve.
Despite Hasina's close ties with China, including joining the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing is expected to establish strong relations with the new government as well.

**********Will the new Saudi Law Help Migrant Domestic Workers?
Why in the News?
Saudi Arabia, a major global employer of migrant domestic workers (MDWs), is set to implement a new domestic worker’s law.
The six GCC states (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain) collectively employ nearly 5.5 million MDWs.
However, all six countries exclude MDWs from their general labour laws, with only four having enacted specific legislation for domestic workers.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia (Overview, Laws, Categories of MDWs, Kafala System)
New Law (Features, Concerns, etc.)
Indian Workers in Saudi Arabia
Overview of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia:
As of Q1 2024, Saudi Arabia hosts 3.91 million migrant domestic workers (MDWs), comprising 27.32 lakh males and 11.81 lakh females, which constitutes 25% of the total workforce.
The exclusion of MDWs from labor laws creates significant protection gaps, as critical monitoring mechanisms such as labor inspections and the Wages Protection System (WPS) do not apply to this sector.
These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the
Kafala system
, where the employer-tied visa arrangement leaves lower-income migrant workers at the mercy of their sponsors, effectively outsourcing immigration control to individuals.
Current and Upcoming MDW Laws:
The upcoming MDW laws fall short in addressing existing protection gaps.
Female MDWs, in particular, suffer extreme abuse both from employers and officials when seeking remedies.
Despite regulations, Saudi Arabia’s justice mechanisms fail to adequately protect MDWs.
Additionally, the
country lacks a minimum wage, with wages often determined by bilateral agreements
Overworked MDWs receive poor pay without clear overtime calculations.
Categories of Migrant Domestic Workers:
MDWs in Saudi Arabia are employed across 14 categories, including roles such as domestic workers, drivers, nannies, cooks, and even specialized roles like physiotherapists.
The largest category, ‘servants and house cleaners,’ includes over 20 lakh workers, with nearly 60% being female.
Male domestic workers, particularly drivers, make up nearly 70% of the sector in Saudi Arabia, reflecting cultural norms and household dependencies.
The Kafala System and Its Implications:
The Kafala system, combined with exclusion from labor laws, gives employers absolute control over MDWs, often leading to bonded labor conditions.
Recruitment costs, excluding wages, range between $2,000 and $5,000, fostering a perception among employers that they have "bought" the worker.
Musaned system
, which regulates MDW recruitment and employment, tends to favour employers, further entrenching these issues.
Features of the New MDW Law:
The new law introduces several positive changes, including:
A maximum of 10 working hours per day
Weekly off days
Prohibition of identity document confiscation
Workers’ rights to communication
Conditions for contract termination without losing entitlements
Compensation for unjust termination
One month of paid leave annually
Employer-paid annual ticket home
Additionally, Saudi has introduced mandatory insurance on new MDW contracts and included MDWs in the WPS from July 2024, with plans to cover all existing MDWs by the end of 2025.
Concerns Regarding the New Law:
Saudi Arabia has a poor track record in implementing protections for migrant workers, with widespread wage theft and labor exploitation.
Female MDWs remain vulnerable, particularly due to the risk of being reported as absconding if they leave their employer’s household without permission.
Despite reforms to the absconding regime, the law can still be weaponized by abusive employers.
Limited labor inspections, communication barriers, and language issues hinder both the assessment of reform impacts and the reporting of violations by workers.
Status of Indian MDWs:
Indians,
making up 26.5 lakh of the migrant population in Saudi Arabia
, are significantly represented in the domestic work sector.
The recruitment of Indian MDWs must be through the eMigrate system, with a minimum referral wage set at SAR1,500 (₹33,400).
Special provisions include a minimum age of 30 for female MDWs and a $2,500 financial bank guarantee.
However, consular support for distressed workers is often limited to repatriation, with little assistance provided for access to justice or securing entitlements before deportation.
The Embassy in Riyadh and the consulate in Jeddah are under-resourced to meet these needs effectively.
