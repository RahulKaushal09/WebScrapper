About Namami Gange Programme
The Government of India mandated in 2018
minimum E-flow for various stretches of the Ganga River to be maintained year-round.
Following this, the
National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG)
, an arm of the Jal Shakti Ministry, laid down the flow specifications essential for -
Preserving the river's ecological balance, safeguarding aquatic life, and
Ensuring sustainability amidst diverse water usage demands.
From the upper Ganga Basin to its confluences and beyond,
stringent measures are in place to ensure compliance with E-flow norms
, benefiting both existing and future projects.
With monitoring and regulatory mechanisms, Ganga's ecological resilience is being safeguarded for generations to come.
It has been developed by the NMCG and allows
real-time analysis of the water quality of the Ganga, Yamuna, and their tributaries.
It also allows monitoring of the Namami Gange programme
activities at the central level, including -
Monitoring the performance of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), and
Ensuring that they operate at their rated capacity.
The Namami Gange programme
is a flagship programme of the Ministry that involved cleaning the Ganga and now includes its tributaries.
The E-flow Monitoring System marks a significant step towards
ensuring the continuous and sustainable flow
of the Ganga River.
The system will track key parameters
such as in-flow, out-flow, and mandated E-flow across 11 projects along the Ganga Mainstream.
About Namami Gange Programme:
It is
an integrated conservation mission
, approved as ‘Flagship Programme’ by the Union Government in
2014
with budget outlay of Rs.20,000 Crores.
It is administered by the
Ministry of Jal Shakti
's Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation,
to accomplish the twin objectives of
Effective abatement of pollution,
Conservation and rejuvenation of National River Ganga.
The program would be implemented by the
(NMCG), and its state counterpart organisations i.e., State Program Management Groups (SPMGs).
NMCG is the implementation
wing of National Ganga Council (NGC), which replaced the National Ganga River Basin Authority.
NGC was created in 2016 under the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016, and is headed by the PM.
In order to implement the programme,
a three-tier mechanism
has been proposed for project monitoring comprising of:
A high-level task force chaired by
Cabinet Secretary
assisted by NMCG at the national level,
State level committee chaired by
Chief Secretary
assisted by SPMG at the state level and
District level committee chaired by the
District Magistrate.
Its implementation has been divided into -
Entry-Level Activities (for immediate visible impact),
Medium-Term Activities (to be implemented within 5 years of time frame) and
Long-Term Activities (to be implemented within 10 years).

Case Study
**********Should the Recent Stock Market Volatility be Probed?
Why in the News?
The Indian stock market experienced significant fluctuations following the release of exit poll results earlier this month and again on June 4 when the Lok Sabha election results were announced.
However, the benchmark indices, the Nifty and the Sensex, have since managed to regain their losses.
The main opposition party has accused PM Modi and Union Home Minister of manipulating the stock market through their statements to benefit certain investors.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
Opposition’s Allegations & SEBI’s Norms
Central Govt.’s Response
Background:
On June 3, after the exit poll results indicated a strong win for the BJP, the Nifty and the Sensex both surged, gaining 3.2% and 3.4%, respectively, reaching all-time highs.
Companies seen as close to the government, like the Adani Group, and public sector companies, which were expected to benefit from PM Modi's third term, saw the biggest gains.
However, the very next day, June 4, both indices dropped by nearly 6% when the actual election results did not meet the exit poll predictions.
This drop was the worst single-day fall since March 2020, during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in India, and
wiped out about ₹30 lakh crore of investor wealth
Before the exit poll results, the
Prime Minister and the Home Minister had encouraged investors to buy stocks before June 4 to benefit from the anticipated election results
Opposition’s Allegations:
The opposition has accused PM Modi and HM Shah of urging retail investors to buy stocks before the election results as a way to manipulate the market for the benefit of certain foreign investors.
It has highlighted that the value of stocks traded for cash doubled on May 31, the last trading day before the exit poll results were released.
On that day, ₹2.3 lakh crore worth of stocks were traded, up from ₹1.1 lakh crore the previous day.
He pointed out that over half of the buying on May 31 came from foreign investors who had been mostly selling stocks before that day.
Analysts suggested that the
PM’s statements urging investors to buy stocks before June 4 helped these foreign investors, who bought stocks before the exit poll results caused a 3% rise in the market
The Opposition claims these foreign investors had insider information about the exit poll results and sold their stocks to retail investors, who then faced significant losses on Tuesday.
The Opposition is calling for a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to investigate the matter.
What Are SEBI’s Norms on This Issue?
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) states that
spreading false or misleading news to influence the buying or selling of securities is illegal
However, general comments on market trends made through mass media like TV and newspapers are allowed.
These are different from secretly leaking information to specific investors for profit.
Therefore, unless it can be proven that PM Modi collaborated with certain investors to boost the market before the exit poll results, his public statements encouraging investors to buy before June 4 are probably not illegal.
Central Government’s Response:
Union Minister Piyush Goyal countered the Opposition’s claims by saying that
foreign investors bought stocks at high prices and sold them at low prices, while Indian investors took advantage of the market's fluctuations to sell high and buy low
Data from NSE supports this, showing that retail investors were net sellers on May 31 and June 3, when the market rose, and net buyers on June 4, when the market crashed.

**********G7 Summit commits to promoting IMEC
Why in news?
The Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations have pledged to support concrete infrastructure initiatives, including the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).
This commitment was made in the G7 Summit Communique, released at the end of the three-day G7 Summit, which was attended by PM Modi (India was a special invitee along with Brazil, Argentina, UAE and Turkiye, among others.).
What’s in today’s article?
Middle Corridor
Partnership for Global Infrastructure (PGII)
Support extended by G7 to various infrastructure projects
About
The Middle Corridor, officially known as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR), is a key logistics and transportation route that connects Europe and Asia.
It provides an alternative to the traditional Northern and Southern corridors, enhancing trade and economic cooperation between the regions it traverses.
The Middle Corridor begins in Southeast Asia and China, crosses Central Asia through countries such as Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, and reaches Europe via Turkey.
The corridor involves multimodal transportation, including rail, road, and maritime routes across the Caspian Sea.
Background
At the sidelines of the G20 Summit held in New Delhi in September 2023, an MoU was signed to develop a rail and shipping corridor connecting India to Europe.
This corridor would pass via the Middle East between India, United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Italy, and the EU.
It has been known as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).
The IMEC is a major infrastructure initiative aimed at enhancing connectivity and economic integration between India, the Middle East, and Europe.
It involves the development of a comprehensive network of transportation, energy, and communication infrastructure, facilitating trade and economic cooperation across these regions.
Significance
Economic Growth -
The IMEC corridor can significantly boost trade and investment opportunities, contributing to economic growth in India and the participating regions.
Enhanced connectivity will reduce transportation costs and time, making trade more efficient and competitive.
Strategic Connectivity
- The corridor provides India with direct access to European markets and the Middle East, bypassing traditional routes.
This strategic connectivity is crucial for India's global trade aspirations and its aim to become a major player in global supply chains.
Energy Security
- The corridor can facilitate energy cooperation, allowing India to diversify its energy sources by tapping into the Middle Eastern energy supplies.
This diversification is essential for India's energy security and reducing dependency on specific regions.
Technological and Infrastructure Development
: Participation in IMEC can lead to significant technological and infrastructure advancements in India, promoting modernization in transportation, communication, and energy sectors.
Geopolitical Influence
: The corridor strengthens India's geopolitical influence by enhancing its role in global trade networks and fostering closer ties with key regions like the Middle East and Europe.
The IMEC is also seen as an initiative by like-minded nations to gain strategic influence in the face of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
BRI has faced increasing criticism over lack of transparency and disregard for sovereignty of the nations.
Challenges
Political Instability
: The corridor passes through regions with varying degrees of political instability, particularly in the Middle East.
The ongoing Israel-Hamas war is further complicating the issue of safe transportation through this region.
Funding and Investment
: Securing adequate funding and investment for such a large-scale infrastructure project is a significant challenge.
Regulatory and Legal Issues
: Harmonizing regulatory and legal frameworks across different countries is complex.
Differences in trade policies, customs regulations, and legal standards can hinder seamless connectivity and trade.
Security Concerns
: The corridor needs to address security threats, including piracy, terrorism, and geopolitical tensions.
At the 2021 G7 Summit, G7 leaders had announced their intent to develop a values-driven, high-impact, and transparent infrastructure partnership.
It was to meet the enormous infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries and support the US’ and its allies’ economic and national security interests.
At the 2022 G7 summit, the participating leaders formally launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure (PGII).
Launched at 48th G7 Summit, being held at Germany, this initiative is meant to
mobilise hundreds of billions of dollars; and
deliver quality, sustainable infrastructure that makes a difference in people’s lives around the world.
Under this, G7 leaders pledged to raise $600 billion in private and public funds over five years to finance needed infrastructure in the developing countries.
Four priority pillars of PGII
Climate and energy security
Tackling the climate crisis and bolstering global energy security through investments in climate resilient infrastructure, transformational energy technologies.
Digital connectivity
Developing, expanding, and deploying secure ICT networks and infrastructure to power economic growth and facilitate open digital societies.
Gender equality and equity
Advancing gender equality and equity by investing in
care infrastructure that increases opportunities for economic participation by women,
improved water and sanitation infrastructure that addresses gender gaps in unpaid work and time use.
Health and health security
Developing and upgrading the infrastructure of health systems and contributing to global health security.
Support extended to IMEC
At the end of the three-day G7 Summit held in Apulia, Italy, the Group of Seven nations committed to promote the IMEC.
Support to other infrastructure project
G7 also extended support for the Lobito Corridor in Central Africa and Luzon Corridor and the Middle Corridor.
–It extends from the port city of Lobito on the Atlantic coast of Angola through the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and into Zambia.
- Itis a strategic economic and infrastructure corridor located on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. Luzon is the largest and most populous island in the Philippines.
Support extended to PGII
G7 leaders decided to promote concrete G7 PGII (Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment) initiatives, flagship projects.

**********Centre considers extension of Smart Cities Mission
Why in news?
With only 15 days left until the June 30 deadline, the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry is thinking about extending the Smart Cities Mission. This extension would give cities more time to finish ongoing projects, which make up about 10% of all the projects.
What’s in today’s article?
About
It was launched on 25 June, 2015, with the objective
to promote cities
that provide core infrastructure, clean and sustainable environment.
100 cities
have been selected to be developed as Smart Cities (through a two-stage competition) in various rounds from 2016 to 2018, with
each getting five years from their selection to complete the projects.
i.e., the original deadlines were from 2021 to 2023.
After the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, the deadline for all 100 cities was fixed to June 2023 in 2021.
In May last year, the Ministry again extended the deadline, this time to June 30, 2024.
It is a
Centrally Sponsored Scheme
under the Union
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).
The Central Government will give financial support to the extent of Rs. 48,000 crores over 5 years i.e., on an average
100 crore per city per year
An equal amount on a matching basis is to be provided by the State/ULB.
Principles
The six fundamental principles on which the concept of Smart Cities is based are:
Objective of SCM
It will ensure a decent quality of life to their citizens through the application of ‘
smart solutions’
It aims to
drive economic growth and improve quality of life
through comprehensive work on social, economic, physical and institutional pillars of the city.
The focus is on
sustainable and inclusive development
by creation of replicable models which act as lighthouses to other aspiring cities.
Financing of Smart Cities Mission
The Smart Cities Mission in India is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme.
It requires state governments and urban local bodies (ULBs) to contribute an equal amount for implementing projects under the Smart City Proposal (SCP).
Performance of SCM
Out of the completed projects, 5,588 projects worth Rs 65,996 crore were funded under the Mission.
The remaining are from the cities’ own resources, PPP mode, convergence with other missions and other sources.
All 100 cities have set up Integrated Command and Control Centres at a cost of Rs 11,775 crore.
The different categories which account for the top categories of completed works include:
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) projects worth Rs 44,300;
smart mobility projects worth Rs 33,019 crore; and
smart governance projects worth Rs 15,474 crore.
Report of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Housing and Urban Affairs
In February 2024, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Housing and Urban Affairs has submitted its report on the evaluation of the Smart Cities Mission presented in the Lok Sabha.
The report said that 400 projects, out of the 7,970, worth Rs 22,814 crore would take beyond December 2024 to complete.
Among the various reasons cited by the report for the delays were difficulties in resettlement of local population and legal issues such as land procurement.
Frequent transfers of smart cities’ CEOs and delay in projects that require convergence with other government ministries or agencies were also flagged.
It further said that in case of non-completion of these projects within the extended time frame,
the state governments concerned will have to complete the projects at their own cost
