Why is Salt Pan Land Being Used for Homes?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
About Salt Pans (Meaning, Maharashtra’s Plan, Terms, Concerns, Way Ahead, etc.)
Background:
In October 2024, the
Maharashtra government made a notable decision to allocate 255.9 acres of salt pan land in Mumbai's eastern suburbs for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project
This land will be used for constructing rental houses to resettle residents from the slum area of Dharavi.
The move has sparked debate among urban planners, environmentalists, and government officials due to its ecological and urban planning implications.
What are Salt Pans?
Salt pans
are low-lying coastal areas where salt is cultivated through the evaporation of seawater. These lands are
ecologically significant
because they serve several crucial functions:
They act as
natural sponges
, absorbing rainwater and mitigating the risk of flooding in coastal regions.
They support
intertidal activities
and provide habitats for a diverse range of flora and fauna.
Salt pans form part of a coastal area’s
natural defense system
against storms and flooding.
Due to these characteristics, salt pans are considered critical for maintaining ecological balance, especially in densely populated cities like
, where flood risks are high.
The Maharashtra Government’s Decision:
The state of Maharashtra has about
13,000 acres of salt pan land
The Maharashtra government’s plan involves using
three major salt pan land parcels
for the project:
Arthur Salt Works Land
in Kanjur (120.5 acres)
Jenkins Salt Works Land
in Kanjur and Bhandup (76.9 acres)
Jamasp Salt Works Land
in Mulund (58.5 acres)
These lands will be used to develop rental housing for people displaced from Dharavi, as part of the
Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)
This development is part of the larger
Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) 2034
plan, which aims to open up
1,781 acres
of salt pan land for development.
The land parcels being allocated are owned by the Central government, and in
September 2024
Union Cabinet
approved the proposal for transferring the land to the Maharashtra government for this purpose.
Terms for the Allocation of Land:
The Maharashtra government has set specific terms for the allocation of salt pan land:
The land will be leased for
99 years
25% of the prevailing market rate
Dharavi Redevelopment Project Private Limited (DRPPL)
, a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in which the
Adani Group
holds an 80% stake and the State government a 20% stake, will be responsible for paying the land revenue to the Central government.
The SPV will bear the costs of resettling laborers currently working on the salt pans and other incidental expenses related to land acquisition.
Importantly, the land allocated for housing projects cannot be used for commercial activities and is strictly reserved for
slum rehabilitation
affordable housing for economically weaker sections
Concerns from Urban Planners & Environmentalists:
The decision to use ecologically sensitive salt pan lands for housing has raised several concerns:
Ecological Impact
Salt pan lands, especially those near the
Eastern Express Highway
, play a vital role in protecting Mumbai’s eastern suburbs from flooding.
Urban planners argue that an
impact assessment
study
should be conducted before allowing large-scale construction on these lands.
Formation of Ghettos
One of the key concerns regarding the Dharavi Redevelopment Project is the
relocation of residents to different parts of the city
, which could lead to the creation of ghettos, segregating communities rather than integrating them.
Urban planners have advocated for
in-situ rehabilitation
, where people are resettled within or near their original locality.
Legal Challenges
Environmentalists have raised concerns about the impact of
intensive urban activity
on such a delicate ecosystem.
They argue that the entire process could face
legal challenges
, particularly regarding
environmental clearances
Before any construction begins, the project will require approval from the
Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)
Conclusion:
The use of salt pan lands for housing developments, particularly for the DRP, is a controversial move that involves a delicate balance between addressing urban housing needs and protecting the environment.
While the Maharashtra government aims to provide affordable housing to economically weaker sections, environmentalists and urban planners caution that the ecological impact of such a decision needs to be carefully assessed to avoid long-term consequences.
With the salt pan lands being an essential part of Mumbai’s defense against flooding, their development for housing must be approached with caution and thorough impact studies.

**********Israel’s ban on the UN chief
Why in news?
Recently, Israel had banned United Nations Secretary- General (UNSG) António Guterres from entering the country. Israel accused him of “backing” Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iran.
What’s in today’s article?
Why did Israel declare UNSG Persona Non Grata?
Unprecedented Nature of Israel’s Ban of UNSG
History to Israel-UN tensions
Global Reactions to Israel’s Ban on UNSG
Reason for Declaration
Israeli Foreign Minister declared United Nations Secretary-General (UNSG) António Guterres as persona non grata (PNG), barring him from setting foot in Israel.
This decision was taken due to the UNSG’s failure to "unequivocally condemn" Iran’s missile strikes on Israel.
Accusation of Silence on Previous Hamas Attack
Israel also criticized Guterres for not condemning a previous attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 Israelis and the taking of 250 hostages.
UNSG's Previous Statements
Contrary to Israel's claims, Mr. Guterres and UN bodies have condemned the Hamas attack multiple times.
In April, the UNSG condemned the use of "sexual violence, torture, and kidnapping of civilians," labeling the atrocities by Hamas as unjustifiable.
Guterres’ Response to Recent Escalations
In the latest conflict escalation, including Israeli strikes on Lebanon and Iran’s launch of 200 missiles on Israeli bases, Guterres called for a ceasefire and condemned the broadening of the conflict but did not name Israel or Iran specifically.
UNSG's Clarification
Following Israel's declaration of the PNG status, Guterres issued a clarification strongly condemning the "massive missile attack by Iran on Israel."
Despite this, Israel has not revoked the ban.
Israel’s ban on UNSG António Guterres is unprecedented.
Analysts say that the closest a similar action occurred was in 1950 when the USSR accused UNSG Trygve Lie of bias during the Korean crisis and threatened to veto his re-election.
Later, the U.S. had banned former UNSG Kurt Waldheim in 1987 due to his complicity in Nazi war crimes during World War II.
But this happened after his term as UNSG and during his presidency of Austria.
Citing Article 100, paragraph 2 of the UN Charter, they emphasized the importance of the UNSG for both substantive and logistical reasons.
This paragraph requires
member states to respect the Secretary-General's independence
Israeli Criticism of the UN
Israel’s ban on Mr. Guterres is part of its broader argument that the UN is controlled by an “anti-Israel” bloc of Arab and Islamic countries.
It accuses affiliated
organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) of being involved with Hamas
Israeli Prime Minister’s Accusations
At the UN General Assembly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the UN, referring to it as an “anti-Semitic swamp.”
His anger stemmed from resolutions calling for a ceasefire and criticizing Israel, which were supported by a large majority of countries.
Previous Bans on UN Officials
Israel has previously banned UN Special Rapporteurs and senior officials, accusing them of bias against Israel and favoring the Palestinian cause.
Last year, Israel banned UN Under-Secretary General Martin Griffiths for remarks perceived as critical of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.
The day after Israel's ban on UNSG, the UN Security Council (UNSC), with the agreement of all P-5 members, issued a statement calling the decision “counterproductive,” especially amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.
The U.S. State Department similarly criticized the move, stating that it was “not productive” for Israel’s global standing.
India’s Ministry of External Affairs, while cautious not to criticize Israel too directly, dismissed the issue.
India affirmed that Mr. Guterres remains the UNSG for India.

**********India’s energy demand to triple by 2050
Why in news?
As per energy experts, India is emerging as a critical player in the global energy transition, driven by its 7% GDP growth and rising power demand. They have noted that India is now the third-largest power market,
with energy demand set to triple by 2050
Despite expanding renewable energy, 70% of India's power still comes from coal, with 50 GW of coal and 10 GW of nuclear expected by 2030. In this context, they emphasized the need for increased electrification, energy storage, and grid infrastructure.
They emphasized India's growing role in the energy transition, with more solar and wind projects expected than coal plants by 2030. They also stressed the importance of battery energy storage systems (BESS) to manage renewable energy intermittency and grid stability.
They, further, pointed to India's growing lithium-ion battery production, with capacity expected to reach 150 gigawatt hours by 2030, covering 13% of global demand.
What’s in today’s article?
India’s energy profile
Issues
Background
India is experiencing rapid energy demand growth, but its overall energy consumption per person remains low compared to global averages.
In 2023,
India ranked third in primary energy consumption globally
, at 39.02 exajoules (EJ), behind China (170.74 EJ) and the USA (94.28 EJ).
However,
India's per capita energy consumption was just 27.3 gigajoules (GJ
), far below China’s 120 GJ and the US’s 277.3 GJ.
India's per capita usage is comparable to Southern African countries (excluding South Africa) and much lower than the world average of 77 GJ.
While India is steadily increasing its energy use, it is still far from reaching the consumption levels associated with high human development (around 100 GJ per person), which other large economies have already surpassed.
Energy consumption
Growth
In 2023, India’s energy consumption grew by over 7.3 percent compared to 5.6 percent in 2022.
The revival of economic activity following the end of the pandemic was among many drivers of growth in energy consumption in 2023.
Fossil Fuel Consumption
India’s Coal Consumption in 2023
In 2023, India’s coal consumption for power generation reached 749 million tonnes (MT), surpassing the combined consumption of the US (280 MT) and Europe (286 MT).
The increase mainly reflected a decline in coal consumption in the US and Europe, where coal is being replaced by cleaner alternatives.
Coal use in the US fell by over 17%, and in Europe by over 16%, while India’s coal consumption grew by 9% due to industrial growth and increased household electricity use during a hot summer.
Despite this,
per capita coal consumption in the US was still over 50% higher than in India, and China's per capita consumption was four times higher
India’s Oil Consumption in 2023
India's oil consumption stood at 5.18 million barrels per day in 2023, the
fourth largest globally after the US, China, and Europe
The US's oil consumption was nearly equivalent to the combined totals of China and India.
Per capita oil use in the US was more than 15 times higher than in India.
India’s Natural Gas Consumption in 2023
India's natural gas consumption in 2023 was 62.6 billion cubic meters (BCM), accounting for just 1.6% of global consumption. The US was the largest consumer (886.5 BCM), followed by Europe (463.4 BCM) and Russia (453.4 BCM).
Non-Fossil Fuel Consumption
In 2023, India saw a 15% decline in hydropower consumption due to reduced rainfall, following an 8.9% growth in 2022.
However, India ranked fourth in global renewable energy consumption, behind China, the US, and Europe, which together accounted for nearly 60% of global renewables usage.
India contributed 6.9% of global renewables consumption, with an impressive annual growth of 18.7% in 2023.
India's Energy Profile vs. Global Energy Profile
India's energy consumption differs significantly from the global average in coal and natural gas usage.
Coal accounts for 59% of India’s commercial energy consumption, compared to 26% globally, while natural gas makes up around 6% of India’s energy mix, versus 26% globally.
This divergence is due to India’s domestic coal availability, which ensures energy security and affordability.
In other energy sources, India is more aligned with global averages.
Overemphasis on Coal in the Global South
The dominant global narrative often overemphasizes coal consumption in the Global South while downplaying oil and natural gas consumption in the Global North, even though all are carbon-emitting fossil fuels.
This focus
overlooks the underconsumption of energy in the Global South, which leads to more severe health and economic consequences
Energy Consumption: Global South vs. Global North
The Global South, which accounts for 85% of the global population and 39% of global GDP, consumed over 389 exajoules (EJ) of energy, compared to the Global North’s 286 EJ.
Given these disparities, it is time for the Global South, led by India, to reshape the global energy narrative to reflect its realities and challenges.

**********Who was Rani Durgavati?
The Madhya Pradesh cabinet recently approved the formation of a panel to develop a memorial and garden dedicated to Gond queen Rani Durgavati for Rs 100 crore.
About Rani Durgavati:
Rani Durgavati (1524-2024) was the
descendant of the famous Chandela dynasty
of Mahoba and the
queen of the Gond kingdom of Garha-Katanga
She was born on 5th October 1524 A.D. in the family of the famous Chandel emperor Keerat Rai.
The Chandel Dynasty
is famous
in Indian history for the valiant
king Vidyadhar,
who
repulsed the attacks of Mehmood Gaznavi.
His
love for sculptures
is shown in the world-
famous temples of Khajuraho
Kalanjar Fort.
Rani Durgavati was born in Kalinjar (Banda, U.P.), one of the most important forts of medieval India.
In 1542, she was
married to Dalpatshah
, the eldest
son of King Sangramshah of the Gond Dynasty
. Chandel and Gond dynasties got
closer
as a consequence of this marriage.
She gave birth to a son in 1545 A.D. who was named Vir Narayan.
Dalpatshah died in about 1550 A.D. As Vir Narayan was too young at that time, Durgavati took the reins of the Gond kingdom in her hands.
Two ministers, Adhar Kayastha and Man Thakur, helped the Rani
in looking after the administration successfully and effectively.
Rani moved her capital to Chauragarh
in place of Singaurgarh. It was a fort of strategic importance situated on the Satpura hill range.
It is said that
trade flourished
during this period.
People were prosperous.
Like her husband’s predecessors, she
extended her territory
and accomplished the
political unification of Gondwana
, also
called Garha-Katanga,
with courage, generosity, and tact.
She distinguished
herself as a warrior
fought with unvarying success against Baz
Bahadur, the Sultan of Malwa.
In the year 1562, Akbar vanquished the Malwa ruler Baj Bahadur and annexed the Malwa with Mughal dominion. Consequently, the state boundary of Rani touched the Mughal kingdom.
She is chiefly
remembered for
defending Gondwana against the Mughal Empire
. She took on the might of the Mughal Empire with great courage and leadership.
Though she
finally faced defeat at the hands of the Mughal army,
she is remembered as a warrior in blood and spirit.
