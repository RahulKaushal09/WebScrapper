NEXUS REPORT
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – ENVIRONMENT
Context:
Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a global group of scientific experts, has released an Assessment Report on the Interlinkages among Biodiversity, Water, Food and Health – known as the Nexus Report.
Background: –
This is a first-of-a-kind report looking at the interconnections between the multiple crises. The group examined five major challenges — climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, water scarcity, and health risks — and found that they were strongly interconnected.
What is IPBES?
IPBES is to biodiversity and natural ecosystems what Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is to climate change. It periodically examines all the existing scientific knowledge on biodiversity and nature to make an assessment of their current state.
Just like IPCC, IPBES too does not produce new science. It only evaluates the existing knowledge to make consolidated assessments.
IPBES, set up in 2012, informs several multilateral environmental processes, including the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Combating Desertification (CCD), the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.
IPBES produced its first report in 2019 in which it assessed the threat to global biodiversity. The information in this report became the basis for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
What does the latest report say?
Nexus Report has highlighted the strong interlinkages between the five identified global challenges. Its key takeaway is that responses to all these challenges need to be harmonised so that positive actions taken on any one of these does not result in negative impacts on others.
For example, an attempt to scale up food production, a positive action to deal with hunger and malnutrition, could have the unintended consequence of increasing stress on land and water resources and biodiversity. Exclusive focus on climate change could also go down on the same pathway.
The report, therefore, argues that it was important to adopt synergistic approaches that deliver benefits across the spectrum.
Report identified over 70 synergetic approach response options that produced positive outcomes across the five elements. Examples of such response measures included restoration of carbon-rich ecosystems such as forests, soils and mangroves, effective management of biodiversity to reduce risks of diseases spreading from animals to humans, promotion of sustainable healthy diets, and reliance on nature-based solutions wherever possible.
The report pointed out that more than half of the global GDP — was moderately to highly dependent on nature.
Transformative Change Report
In another report released simultaneously, IPBES called for fundamental and transformative shifts in the way people view and interact with the natural world in pursuit of its well-being.
This report, being called the Transformative Change Report, said current, and previous, approaches to deal with ecological decline had failed, and a new and different approach was needed.
This new and transformative approach, it said, must be based on four fundamental principles — equity and justice, pluralism and inclusion, respectful and reciprocal human-nature relationships, and adaptive learning and action.
It said the world needed to act immediately on new approaches because the cost of delaying action would increase the costs. There were also benefits to be had from immediate action. It said recent estimates suggested that more than 10 trillion dollars in business opportunities, and about 400 million jobs, could be generated by 2030 through sustainable economic approaches that rely on nature-positive economic models.

SPADEX MISSION
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
The satellites for the SpaDeX mission are set to launch onboard the PSLV C60 mission on December 30, 2024.
If the SpaDeX test is successful, India will become the fourth country in the world to have a space programme capable of docking in space.
Key takeaways:
The SpaDeX mission (Space Docking Experiment) is an ambitious project by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) aimed at demonstrating in-space docking technology.
The primary goal of the SpaDeX mission is to develop and demonstrate the technology required for rendezvous, docking, and undocking of two small spacecraft in low-Earth orbit.
ISRO needs to master in-space docking so that satellites launched in separate rocket launches can link up to perform more sophisticated tasks. The technology will be essential for the ‘Bharatiya Antariksh Station,’ a new India-made space station ISRO has begun work on.
Mission Details:
Spacecraft: The mission involves two small spacecraft, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target), each weighing approximately 220 kg.
Launch: The spacecraft will be launched aboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C60) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.
Orbit: Both spacecraft will be injected into a 470 km circular orbit at a 55° inclination.
Docking Process: The mission will demonstrate the docking of the two spacecraft, followed by the transfer of electrical power between them. After successful docking, the spacecraft will undock and operate their respective payloads for up to two years.

GREEN DEPOSITS
Prelims & Mains – ECONOMY
Considering the threat that climate change poses globally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in April last year issued a comprehensive framework for lenders to accept green deposits. However, more than 20 months after the framework has been issued, lenders have made little to no progress in garnering green deposits.
Bankers say a reduction in cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement for green deposit will help.
What is green deposit?
Green deposits are essentially interest-bearing deposits, received by the lenders for a fixed period and the proceeds of which are earmarked for being allocated towards green finance.
The deposits shall be denominated only in Indian rupees as per RBI norms.
Capital raised via green deposits can be used in funding projects related to solar, wind, biomass, and hydropower energy projects that integrate energy generation and storage. Further, the funds can be used in sectors which enable energy efficiency, clean transportation, climate change adaptation and sustainable water and waste management. Green deposits also can be used for funding green buildings, projects relating to coastal and marine environments, certified organic farming, among others.
To ensure compliance, RBI said that allocation of funds raised through green deposits during a financial year shall be subject to an independent third-party audit.
Challenges to Green Deposits in India
Limited Customer Interest and Awareness : Many customers lack awareness of these products and their potential impact. Without a strong alignment of values or incentives, green deposits fail to attract interest from the general public.
Lower Interest Rates : Green deposits typically offer lower interest rates compared to standard deposit products.
Slow Adoption Among Private Banks : While most public sector banks have started offering green deposits, private banks have been slower to adopt these products. This hesitance limits the overall availability and visibility of green deposit options.
Competing Priorities for Lending : Given the country’s population and economic structure, banks must prioritize lending to sectors like small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and job creation. This focus can divert attention and resources away from green projects.

PANAMA CANAL
Prelims – GEOGRAPHY
Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump slammed unfair fees for U.S. ships passing through the Panama Canal and threatened to demand that control of the waterway be returned to Washington.
Trump’s comments were an exceedingly rare example of a U.S. leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory.
The Panama Canal is an artificial 82-kilometer (51-mile) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean, cutting across the Isthmus of Panama.
It greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage, the Strait of Magellan or the Beagle Channel.
History:
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-200536 aligncenter" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="213" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/23a-300x213.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/23a-300x213.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/23a.png 605w" width="300"/>
Early Attempts: The idea of creating a water passage across the isthmus of Panama dates back to at least the 1500s. The French first attempted to build a canal in the 1880s but failed due to disease and financial difficulties.
U.S. Construction: The United States took over the project in 1904, and the canal was completed in 1914. The U.S. maintained control over the canal zone until 1999, when it was handed back to Panama.
Modern Era: Panama took full control of the canal in 1999, and it continues to be a vital artery for international shipping.
Structure:
Locks: Locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial fresh water lake 26 meters above sea level, created by damming up the Chagres River and Lake Alajuela to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal. Locks then lower the ships at the other end.
Water Usage: An average of 200 million liters (52 million gallons) of fresh water is used in a single passing of a ship.

**********Panama Canal
Recently, the US President-elect Donald Trump has hinted that his administration might attempt to regain control of the Panama Canal.
About
Panama Canal:
It is a
man made waterway
that connects the
Atlantic and Pacific
oceans
across the Isthmus of Panama.
It is owned and administered by Panama, and it is 40 miles long from shoreline to shoreline.
It was built by the Unites states and
completed in August 1914
It is one of the two most strategic artificial waterways in the world, the other being the Suez Canal.
From its opening in 1914 until 1979, the Panama Canal was controlled solely by the United States, which built it.
In 1979, however, control of the canal passed to the Panama Canal Commission, a joint agency of the United States and the Republic of Panama, and complete control passed to Panama at noon on December 31, 1999.
sophisticated, highly-engineered system
which uses a system of locks and elevators to take ships from one end to the other.
This is needed because the two oceans that the Panama Canal connects do not lie at the same elevation, with the Pacific slightly higher than the Atlantic.
This difference means that for a ship entering the canal through the Atlantic, it needs to gain elevation during its journey to the Pacific. This is achieved
using a lock system
which lifts and drops vessels to the required sea level at either end of the canal.
Basically, locks are either flooded (to gain elevation) or drained (to lose elevation), and act as water elevators. In total, the system comprises three sets of locks — 12 locks in total — which are serviced using artificial lakes and channels.

**********Aerogel
A group of researchers from Pune have developed a novel hybrid aerogel capable of easily extracting gold from electronic waste.
About
Aerogel:
Aerogels are among the
lightest solid materials
They are created by
combining a polymer
with a
solvent to form a gel
, and then removing the liquid from the gel and replacing it with air.
Properties:
They are extremely
porous and very low in density and
they offer advantages like adjustable surface chemistry
They are also known
as ‘solid air’
‘frozen smoke’
are excellent adsorbents (a solid substance used to remove contaminants) and are incredibly lightweight solids composed mostly of air.
Aerogels are most preferred in
environment and oil spill clean up,
for insulation purposes
Key facts about the newly developed Hybrid Aerogel
Researchers have designed and synthesised aerogel: the sponge-like absorbents, light in weight and porous synthetic materials for this purpose.
The aerogel’s unique structural composition was
treated with iron nitrate salts
and maintained at room temperature for about two to five minutes.
This specially designed aerogel was found to be
effective in extracting
and retrieving upto 99 per cent of
gold ions from the e-waste.
In daylight, the hybrid aerogel could extract 1689mg/gram of e-waste and 2349mg / gram under blue light.
As there were dual processes involved, that of adsorption and reduction — the quality of the recovered gold was
reasonably pure
thereby reducing the need for further purifying processes.

**********What is a Dark Pattern?
The Department of Consumer Affairs is launching 'Jago Grahak Jago App,' 'Jagriti App,' and 'Jagriti Dashboard” for public use on National Consumers Day 2024 to protect Consumers from the Dark Patterns.
About
Dark Pattern:
Dark patterns are defined as
any deceptive design patterns
using user interface/user experience interactions on any platform.
The term was coined by
Harry Brignull
in 2010.
They are designed to
mislead or trick users
to do something they originally did not intend or want to do;
It is done by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights.
Central Consumer Protection Authority
notified the Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns in 2023 and specified
13 dark patterns,
namely:
False urgency, Basket Sneaking, Confirm shaming, forced action, Subscription trap, Interface Interference, Bait and switch, Drip Pricing, Disguised Advertisements and Nagging, Trick Wording, Saas Billing and Rogue Malwares.
Key points about 'Jago Grahak Jago App,' 'Jagriti App,' and ‘Jagriti Dashboard’
These are part of an
intelligent cyber-physical system
, which operates in real-time and runs on the Airawat AI Supercomputer under the National Supercomputing Mission for AI and Data Analytics.
This innovative system analyses existing text and design elements on e-commerce platforms to determine whether they are being used to influence consumer psychology.
'Jago Grahak Jago App:
It provides
essential e-commerce information
about all URLs during a consumer’s online activities, alerting them if any URL may be unsafe and requires caution.
'Jagriti App:
It allows
users to report URLs
where they suspect the presence of one or more dark patterns declared illegal. These reports are then registered as complaints to the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) for possible redressal and subsequent action.
: It is used to

**********What is a Speed gun?
Speed guns are widely used by law enforcement officials to monitor traffic speed and in various other industries.
About
Speed gun:
It is a device to
measure the speed of a moving object
without having to be in contact with the object.
To achieve this, the device bounces electromagnetic radiation of a specific frequency off the object, capturing the reflection and
using the Doppler effect to infer the object’s speed.
Speed guns are electronic, and use complex circuitry to emit the radiation used to make the measurement.
The speed gun was originally
developed during World War II
for military use and applies the effect using radio waves rather than sound waves.
How it works?
A speed gun has a
radio transmitter and a receiver
The transmitter emits
radio waves,
which the person holding the speed gun can direct at an object. The receiver collects the waves reflected by the object back in the direction of the speed gun.
If the object is
approaching the speed gun,
the frequency of the returning waves will be slightly higher than that of the transmitted waves. A simple computer in the gun can deduce the object’s speed based on this difference.
How are the speed and the effect linked?
All electromagnetic waves have a fixed speed — equal to the speed of light in that medium.
In vacuum, this value is denoted c: 299,792,458 m/s. Any change in the frequency the speed gun detects directly corresponds to the Doppler shift caused by the object’s motion.
This principle is powerful because it allows the speed gun to work accurately over a wide range of distances and velocities without being affected by air resistance.
A speed gun can
calculate the speed of a moving object
by multiplying the difference (between received and emitted frequencies) with c and dividing by the emitted frequency times 2.
This relationship shows how the
difference is directly proportional
speed of the object
: the faster it moves, the more pronounced the difference will be.
Uses:
It is widely used by
to monitor traffic speed, by coaches to gauge the performance of their athletes, and in various other industries in need of accurate motion tracking.

**********What Can the Budget Do for Agriculture
Context
The
upcoming Union Budget 2025–26 offers a critical opportunity
to reshape India’s agricultural landscape.
Agriculture, the backbone of the Indian economy, requires strategic interventions to enhance productivity,
improve farmer incomes, and address environmental concerns.
Therefore,
it is crucial to delve into key challenges and recommendations to make Indian agriculture more productive,
competitive, and sustainable while safeguarding natural resources.
The Impact of Climate Change and Recommendations to Addressing the Climate Change and Resource Optimisation
India's agriculture sector faces an
unprecedented challenge in the form of climate change,
which threatens to destabilise the delicate balance of its agricultural production systems.
A 0.7°C rise in temperature since 1951 and a 6% reduction in monsoon precipitation have already demonstrated the tangible impacts
of climate variability on crop yields.
With the risk of extreme weather events increasing,
building climate-resilient agricultural systems is imperative for safeguarding the nation’s food security
Investment Boost in Agri R&D
One of the critical strategies to combat these challenges is a
significant boost in agricultural research and development (agri-R&D).
Currently,
India invests less than 0.5% of its agricultural GDP in R&D
, a figure that pales in comparison to global benchmarks.
Doubling this investment to at least 1% of agricultural GDP can support the development of innovative
, climate-resilient crop varieties and farming practices.
Research must focus on drought-tolerant and heat-resistant crops, improved irrigation technologies, and precision agriculture techniques
that optimise resource use while minimising environmental degradation.
Sustainable Farming Practices
Sustainable farming practices must be adopted to improve soil health and water retention
Soil organic carbon
, a key indicator of soil fertility,
has been depleting due to intensive farming practices
and over-reliance on chemical inputs.
Strategies to restore soil health include the use of organic amendments such as compost and bio-fertilisers,
along with crop rotation and cover cropping techniques.
Enhancing soil organic carbon not only boosts productivity but also increases the soil’s ability to sequester carbon
, contributing to climate mitigation efforts.
A Balanced Approach Towards Natural Farming and Fertilisers Use
government’s Natural Farming Mission aims to promote low-input, sustainable agricultural practices.
However,
its potential is limited
in addressing the food demands of a rapidly growing population projected to reach 1.67 billion by 2050.
challenge lies in striking a balance between ecological sustainability and meeting the nutritional needs
of the population.
This
necessitates the use of both bio-fertilisers and chemical fertilisers in an optimal mix,
ensuring that soils receive an appropriate balance of macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and micronutrients (zinc, boron, and iron).
Technological Innovations
Technological innovations such as
nano-urea, nano-DAP (di-ammonium phosphate), and advanced phosphates like single or triple superphosphate have immense potential
to enhance nutrient use efficiency.
their adoption remains limited due to the skewed subsidy structure
favouring conventional granular urea.
By
promoting these technologies through incentives and awareness campaigns, the government can encourage their widespread use
, ensuring better nutrient management and reducing environmental impacts.
Some Other Key Proposals to Make Agriculture More Productive and Competitive for Farmers
Modernising Fertiliser Subsidies and Policies
A transformative approach involves
replacing the existing fertiliser subsidy structure with direct income transfers to farmers
based on landholding size.
shift will free fertiliser prices from regulatory controls, encouraging balanced nutrient application
and reducing environmental harm.
Such a policy will plug leakages, enhance resource efficiency, and align with farmers’ economic interests
, provided it is communicated effectively to build trust.
Building Agri-Value Chains
Agriculture must evolve into a comprehensive food system encompassing production, marketing, and consumption, ensuring both food security and farmers’ income growth.
Drawing inspiration from India’s dairy sector success,
where farmers retain 75-80% of consumer expenditure,
similar value chain systems for fruits and vegetables can revolutionise the sector.
farmers receive only about one-third of consumer spending in these commodities.
Milk, India’s largest agricultural commodity, exemplifies the potential for transformative change.
With 239 million tonnes of production, India leads the world in dairy output.
This success, driven by cooperatives and private sector dairies, can be replicated for perishable produce like fruits and vegetables
through a dedicated board akin to the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).
Such an initiative, led by visionary leadership, could mitigate inflation and stabilize markets.
Reforming Export and Market Policies
India’s current agricultural policies
, marked by export bans on key commodities like onions, wheat, and rice,
are counterproductive.
These
measures depress domestic prices, inflicting implicit taxes on farmers
while reflecting a pro-consumer bias.
For instance,
the Food Corporation of India (FCI) dumps rice and wheat in the domestic market at prices significantly below economic costs,
undermining farmer profitability.
Comparative data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) highlights India’s negative producer support
estimate (PSE) of -15.5%,
contrasting starkly with China’s PSE of 14% and the OECD average of 13.8%.
This disparity underscores the urgent need for market reforms to enhance price support and create a fair playing field for Indian farmers.
The Path Forward: Prioritizing Agriculture in Budget 2025–26
Increased investment in climate-resilient R&D
, reforming fertiliser subsidies, strengthening value chains, and adopting market-aligned policies are pivotal steps.
measures will not only enhance productivity and farmer incomes but also address environmental challenges
and food security concerns.
A balanced, farmer-friendly approach is essential
to transform Indian agriculture into a globally competitive and sustainable sector.
Conclusion
The Union Budget 2025-26 must prioritise agriculture
by addressing climate challenges, rationalising subsidies, and fostering robust value chains.
By transitioning to a sustainable and market-oriented agricultural model, India can secure the livelihoods of its farmers
, meet the nutritional demands of its population, and protect its natural resources.
Effective implementation of these measures will pave the way for a resilient and equitable agricultural sector,
fulfilling its critical role in the nation’s economy and food security.

Editorial Analysis
**********Fourth branch institutions shouldn’t be retirement homes for civil servants, judges
Why in news?
While delivering a speech, Supreme Court judge Justice P S Narasimha said that fourth branch institutions should not be retirement homes for civil servants and judges.
Justice Narasimha was delivering the second edition of the Justice ES Venkataramiah Centennial Memorial Lecture organised by National Law School of India University in Bengaluru.
What’s in today’s article?
Fourth branch institutions in India
Key Highlights of Justice P S Narasimha’s Speech
Fourth Branch Institutions in India
About
Fourth branch institutions refer to constitutionally or statutorily created bodies that function independently of the executive, legislature, and judiciary to uphold accountability, transparency, and democracy.
These institutions act as watchdogs, ensuring that power is not concentrated in any single branch of government.
E.g., the Election Commission of India (ECI), Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), Central Information Commission (CIC), and Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) etc.
Significance
The ECI ensures free and fair elections, bolstering democracy.
Similarly, the CAG's audit of the 2G spectrum allocation and coal block allocation exposed large-scale irregularities, spurring public debate on corruption.
Concerns
Allegations of partisanship against the ECI during certain elections, such as delayed action on violations of the Model Code of Conduct, raise concerns about its autonomy.
The CAG, too, has faced criticism for delays in audits and alleged overestimation of losses.
Furthermore, institutions like the CIC suffer from vacancies and delays in hearing appeals, reducing their effectiveness.
Conclusion
Strengthening these institutions is crucial to safeguard democracy.
Ensuring independence through transparent appointment processes, sufficient funding, and protection from political interference is vital.
Stronger fourth branch institutions will enhance governance, restore public trust, and ensure accountability in a rapidly evolving democratic landscape.
Significance of Fourth Branch Institutions
Justice Narasimha emphasized the critical role of fourth branch institutions such as the EC, CAG, Public Service Commissions, and National Commissions for SCs, STs, and OBCs.
He underlined their importance in ensuring accountability and governance, as envisioned by the Constitution's framers.
Challenges Facing Fourth Branch Institutions
Domain Expertise and Capacity Building
: Justice Narasimha pointed out that domain expertise and institutional capacity are often neglected.
Diversity in Composition
: He highlighted the lack of diversity in these institutions' composition.
Avoiding Retirement Homes
: Justice Narasimha cautioned against turning these
bodies into retirement homes
for civil servants and judges,
advocating for merit-based appointments
Election Commission’s Independence
He lauded the foresight of the Constitution's framers in creating the Election Commission as an independent body, free from executive control, to ensure fair and impartial elections.

**********Indian rupee falling against the US dollar
Why in news?
The Indian rupee has weakened against the US dollar, crossing the 85 mark. In April, the exchange rate was around 83, and a decade ago, it was approximately 61. This reflects a steady decline in the rupee's value relative to the dollar.
What’s in today’s article?
Exchange rate
Factors determining the demand for rupee in comparison to dollar
Factors affecting the three kinds of demands mentioned above
Falling Rupee
Policy Recommendations for India
Understanding Exchange Rates
We use the Indian rupee to buy domestic goods and services, but for international purchases like an American car or Swiss vacation, we first exchange rupees for foreign currencies like the US dollar or euro.
The exchange rate determines how many rupees are needed to buy one unit of a foreign currency.
In the currency market, where currencies are traded like commodities, these rates often fluctuate over time.
Factors Influencing Exchange Rates
Exchange rates are driven by demand and supply dynamics.
If Indians demand more US dollars than Americans demand Indian rupees, the dollar's value rises relative to the rupee, making it costlier.
Persistent demand imbalance strengthens this trend, causing the rupee to weaken against the dollar.
Trade in Goods
If India imports more goods from the US than it exports, the demand for US dollars exceeds that for Indian rupees.
This strengthens the dollar and weakens the rupee, requiring more rupees to buy one dollar.
Trade in Services
Similarly, if Indians purchase more US services (e.g., tourism) than Americans buy Indian services, the dollar's demand rises, causing the rupee to weaken.
Investments
If Americans invest more in India than Indians invest in the US, the demand for the rupee increases, leading to its appreciation against the dollar.
Trade Restrictions
If the US bans or imposes high tariffs on Indian goods, demand for Indian rupees drops as Americans no longer need rupees to buy Indian products. This weakens the rupee.
Inflation Differences
High inflation in India compared to the US erodes the rupee's value.
Investors may avoid or withdraw investments from India due to lower real returns, reducing demand for rupees and further weakening its exchange rate.
About the news
The rupee recently slid to 85.11 against the US dollar, driven more by a strengthening dollar than a weakening rupee.
While the rupee has depreciated against the dollar since September, it has appreciated against other major currencies like the euro, pound, and yen.
Global Factors Driving Dollar Strength
The dollar’s rise stems from US policy concerns, including potential import tariffs, deportations, and tax cuts.
These measures could boost inflation, prompting the US Federal Reserve to maintain tight monetary policy.
This has led to higher US bond yields and a stronger dollar.
Impact of falling rupee
Negative impact
Impact on inflation management
The most crucial impact would be on inflation as the country imports nearly 80% of its crude oil needs.
This would mean that imports would become costlier and travel through the value chain to raise input costs.
Impact on current account deficit
Since a large proportion of India’s imports are dollar-denominated, these imports will get costlier.
Costlier imports, in turn, will widen the trade deficit as well as the current account deficit, which, in turn, will put pressure on the exchange rate.
Positive impact
One positive impact could be that remittances from overseas could become attractive.
A fall in the rupee can also benefit India's exporters - unless they import raw materials, which would become more expensive.
Focus on the rupee’s effective exchange rate against a basket of currencies, not just the dollar.
Avoid using interest rates to defend the rupee; adjust rates based on domestic inflation trends.
Prioritize macroeconomic stability by addressing fiscal and current account deficits, adhering to inflation targets, and reinforcing confidence in India’s growth potential.

**********New Interception Rules and Safeguards
Why in the News?
The Union Government notified the
Telecommunications (Procedures and Safeguards for Lawful Interception of Messages) Rules, 2024
which empower certain enforcement and security agencies to intercept phone messages under certain conditions.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article)
About New Rules (Key Provisions, New Rules vs Old Rules, Significance, Concerns, etc.)
Introduction:
The Union Government has introduced the
, which empower enforcement and security agencies to intercept phone messages under specific conditions.
These rules replace
Rule 419A
Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951
Key Provisions of the New Rules:
Competent Authorities for Issuing Orders
Union Home Secretary
State Home Department Secretaries
are authorized to order message interception.
In "unavoidable circumstances," officers of at least
Joint Secretary rank
in the Union Government can issue interception orders.
Operational-Level Authorizations
In remote areas or during operational needs:
At the central level: Head or second senior-most officer of an authorized agency can order interception.
At the state level: Head or senior-most officer (not below the rank of
Inspector General of Police
) can issue interception orders.
These operational orders must be:
Submitted to the competent authority within
three working days
Confirmed within
seven working days
, or the interception ceases, and collected data cannot be used for any purpose.
Record Destruction
Agencies must destroy interception records every
six months
, unless retained for functional needs or court orders.
How the New Rules Differ from Rule 419A?
Relaxation of 'Emergent Cases' Condition
Previous rules allowed interception only in emergent cases.
The new rules enable interception in "remote areas" or "operational reasons," broadening the scope.
Limits on Officers Authorized to Intercept
Earlier: No limit on the number of officers at the
Inspector General rank
at the state level.
Now: Only the head or the second senior-most officer of the authorized agency can issue interception orders.
Validation of Interception Orders
Any interception order not confirmed within seven days becomes invalid, and collected data cannot be used.
Safeguards & Historical Context:
Indian Telegraph Act, 1885
, granted the Union Government the power to frame safeguards against improper message interception, but no safeguards were framed for years.
Safeguards under
were introduced in 2007 following a
Supreme Court ruling in the PUCL vs. Union of India case (1996)
The court emphasized the need for fair and reasonable safeguards to protect the
right to privacy
Concerns with the New Rules:
Accountability Gaps
The rules lack clear provisions for punitive action against agencies misusing interception powers.
There is no accountability for the misuse of interception during the seven-day period before confirmation.
Potential for Abuse
The relaxation of 'emergent cases' condition without additional checks raises concerns about arbitrary interception.
Conclusion:
aim to provide a framework for lawful interception of messages. However, they have raised questions about potential misuse due to insufficient accountability and safeguards. Policymakers must address these gaps to balance national security needs with individual privacy rights.

**********On Kisan Diwas: Why terms of trade have improved more for farm workers than farmers
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to agricultural labour;
Why in the News?
Crop prices have lagged behind the rising production costs, while agricultural wages have grown faster than inflation over the past two decades.
What is ‘Terms of Trade’?
Terms of Trade (ToT)
refers to the relative prices of goods and services that a country exports compared to the prices of goods and services it imports. In the context of agriculture, it specifically relates to the prices received by farmers for their produce versus the prices they pay for inputs (like seeds, fertilizers, and equipment).
A favourable ToT means that farmers are receiving higher prices for their products relative to their costs, which enhances their profitability.
What factors have contributed to the improved terms of trade for farm workers compared to farmers?
Wage Growth:
Agricultural labourers have experienced significant increases in wages, with their Index of Prices Received (IPR) rising more than threefold from 49.1 to 151.4 between 2004-05 and 2013-14, while their Index of Prices Paid (IPP) increased only modestly from 76.4 to 129.3 during the same period. This resulted in a substantial improvement in their ToT from 64.2% to 117.1%.
Stagnation of Farmer Incomes:
In contrast, farmers’ IPR rose by only 56.3% from 2013-14 to 2022-23, while their IPP increased by 58.4%. This led to a decline in their ToT from 98.6% to 97.2%, indicating that farmers are facing a cost squeeze as input prices rise faster than the prices they receive for their produce.
Economic Diversification:
The expansion of employment opportunities outside agriculture has allowed agricultural labourers to seek better-paying jobs in sectors like construction and services, increasing their bargaining power and wage rates.
How do government policies impact the economic conditions (of farmers versus farm workers)?
Employment Schemes:
Government initiatives such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) have provided rural labourers with guaranteed employment, improving their income stability and negotiating power against employers.
Income Support Programs:
Various states have implemented income support schemes targeting women, which have further tightened the labour market and increased wage demands among agricultural workers. For example, Mukhya Mantri Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Yojana (MMKSY).
Subsidies and Minimum Support Prices:
While subsidies on inputs like fertilizers and electricity have provided some relief to farmers, they have not sufficiently offset the rising costs or improved farmers’ ToT significantly, leading to ongoing economic distress among this group.
What are the broader implications of these changes for the agricultural sector and rural economy?
Shift in Economic Power:
The improved ToT for agricultural labourers relative to farmers reflects a shift in economic power dynamics within rural areas, potentially leading to greater social mobility for labourers but also highlighting the vulnerabilities faced by farmers.
Increased Demand for Labor:
As agricultural labourers gain better wages and conditions, there may be a reduction in available labour for farming activities, leading to challenges for farmers who may struggle to find enough workers willing to accept lower wages or demand better working conditions.
Social Tensions:
The disparities between the economic conditions of farmers and agricultural labourers can lead to social tensions, especially as farmers express dissatisfaction over stagnant incomes while labourers experience wage growth. This situation may exacerbate calls for policy reforms aimed at addressing these inequities.
Way forward:
Enhance Farmer Profitability
: Introduce policies to ensure fair pricing for crops, reduce input costs through targeted subsidies, and promote crop diversification and value addition to improve farmers’ income and Terms of Trade (ToT).
Strengthen Rural Employment
: Expand employment opportunities in rural non-farm sectors and align government schemes like MGNREGA with skill development programs to sustain wage growth for agricultural labourers while addressing labour shortages in farming.
Mains PYQ:
What are the main constraints in the transport and marketing of agricultural produce in India?

The Centre has introduced the Telecommunications (Lawful Interception of Messages) Rules, 2024, replacing Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951, allowing certain agencies to intercept phone messages under specific conditions.
About the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951
The Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951 are a set of regulations that govern the
establishment, maintenance, and operation
telecommunication services
in India.
These rules were framed under the provisions of the
Indian Telegraph Act, 1885
, which is a key legislation that grants the government authority to regulate telecommunication networks in India.
The rules cover various aspects of telecommunication, such as:
The process for obtaining telecommunication licenses.
The rights and obligations of telecommunication service providers.
The use of telecommunication networks for government purposes.
Provisions for the lawful interception and monitoring of communication for security, investigation, and public interest reasons (Rule 419A).
What do the new Telecommunications (Procedures and Safeguards for Lawful Interception of Messages) Rules, 2024 state?
Authorization for interception
Union Home Secretary
and the
Secretary to the State government in charge of the Home Department
can authorize interception orders.
An
officer not below the rank of Joint Secretary
may issue interception orders in
unavoidable circumstances
(the circumstances are not specified).
Remote areas/operational reasons
In remote areas, or for operational reasons, the
head
second senior-most officer
of the authorized agency (at
central
levels) can issue orders.
These orders must be confirmed by the competent authority within
seven days
If not confirmed, the interception ceases and the data cannot be used for any purpose, including
court evidence
Destruction of records
Interception records must be
destroyed every six months
by the authorized agency and review committee, unless required for functional purposes or court directions.
Will it override Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951?
Yes,

**********Challenges of Posthumous Assisted Reproduction (PAR)
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
On October 4, 2024, the
Delhi High Court
allowed
the parents of a
deceased man
use his frozen semen
for
posthumous reproduction
. The court cited a similar 2018 case in Germany and noted that the ART Act, 2021, doesn’t specifically address such situations.
What is Posthumous Assisted Reproduction (PAR)?
Posthumous reproduction refers to the use of
reproductive material
(such as sperm or eggs) from a deceased individual to conceive a child after their death.
This can include
posthumous sperm retrieval
, where sperm is collected from a deceased man (typically through medical procedures shortly after death) for future use in assisted reproductive technologies, like
in vitro fertilization (IVF)
What does the Law says in India?
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Act, 2021
governs all fertility treatments and artificial insemination procedures.
ART Rules, 2022
specify guidelines for posthumous sperm retrieval, but only in cases where the deceased was married, and the surviving spouse is the one requesting the retrieval.
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)
rejected the parents’ request, clarifying that the law does not apply to “post-mortem grandparenthood.”
Surrogacy Regulation Act
applies exclusively to married couples or women with medical needs for surrogacy and does not include grandparents as “intending grandparents.”
Challenges posed by Posthumous Assisted Reproduction (PAR):
PAR presents several
legal
ethical
social
challenges:
Legal Issues
: There’s a lack of clear laws governing the use of gametes after death, especially regarding consent from the deceased and questions about parentage and inheritance. The absence of specific regulations makes it difficult to establish who holds parental rights.
Ethical Concerns
: Issues include the morality of using a deceased person’s genetic material, the commodification of human tissue, and concerns about grandparenthood. The emotional and ethical implications for surviving family members also come into play.
Social and Psychological Issues
: Children born through PAR may face challenges related to knowing their deceased parent, and surviving partners may struggle with grief or guilt. Disputes over the deceased’s wishes can complicate family dynamics.
Biological Considerations
: The long-term storage of gametes can lead to degradation, affecting the quality of embryos or sperm. Preserving genetic material for extended periods also presents technical challenges.
Cultural and Religious Concerns
: Different cultures and religions may oppose posthumous reproduction, viewing it as morally or spiritually problematic.
Access and Equity
: PAR can be expensive and may raise issues of access and commercialization, potentially leading to exploitation or unequal access to these technologies.
