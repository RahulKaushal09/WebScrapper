Australia, U.S., U.K. sign nuclear transfer deal for AUKUS submarines
Why in news?
Australia has signed a deal with the United States and Britain to exchange nuclear secrets and materials, advancing its plan to equip its navy with
nuclear-powered submarines
as part of the 2021 AUKUS security accord.
This agreement binds the three countries to secure arrangements for transferring sensitive nuclear material and know-how.
What’s in today’s article?
AUKUS partnership
About
Signed in September 2021, the new enhanced trilateral security partnership for Indo-Pacific between
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United State
s is named as
“AUKUS”
The
first major initiative
of AUKUS would be to
deliver a nuclear-powered submarine fleet for Australia
These countries, however, made it clear that their
aim is not to arm the new submarines with nuclear weapons
This is because Australia is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) which bans it from acquiring or deploying nuclear weapons.
Key highlights of the deal
The United States intends to sell Australia three US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines, in the early 2030s, with an option for Australia to buy two more if needed.
The multi-stage project would culminate with British and Australian production and operation of a
new submarine class – SSN-AUKUS
SSN-AUKUS will be a trilaterally developed vessel based on Britain’s next-generation design.
It would be built in Britain and Australia and include cutting edge U.S. technologies.
Significance of this deal
For US
US has only shared nuclear submarine technology once before in 1958 with Great Britain.
For Indo-Pacific Region
Under this partnership, technology, scientists, industries and defence forces of these three countries will work together to deliver a safer and more secure region.
Some analysts feel that this partnership will lead to intensified arms race in the region
For Australia
Australia has never had nuclear-powered submarines.
Hence, this step will give Australia naval heft in the Pacific, where China has been particularly aggressive.
Critics, on the other hand, claim that this
deal would antagonise Beijing
which will not be good for Australia.
Australia is now set to join
an elite group of only six countries
– India, US, UK, France, Russia and China – that operate nuclear-powered submarines.
It will also be the only country to have such submarines without having a civilian nuclear power industry.
For India
The new pact will add to the
global efforts to balance China in the region
It should be noted that Australia and India are close strategic partners in the Indo-Pacific region.
Australia is also a member of
QUAD group
. A stronger Australia would lead to further strengthening of QUAD.
For France
France is not happy with the deal and has termed this deal a “stab in the back”.
Australia had signed a contract to buy 12 Attack-class submarines from France in 2016. The first submarine was expected to be operational around 2034.
As a result of the current deal, Australia ditched the contract.
How China views this agreement?
China denounced a new Indo-Pacific security alliance saying
such partnerships should not target third countries
It claims that the current cooperation would
gravely undermine regional peace
stability, aggravate arms race and hurt the international non-proliferation efforts
China claimed that western powers are using
nuclear exports for geopolitical gaming tools
Under this deal, highly-sensitive nuclear powered submarine technology will be exported to Australia.

**********Jewish - A Dwindling Community in India
Why in News?
India's Jewish community is projected to comprise 4,000–5,000 people now, down from 20,000–50,000 in the mid-1940s.
What’s in Today’s Article?
History of the Jews in India
The Jews of Kerala
Why is Jewish Community Dwindling in India/ Kerala?
History of the Jews in India:
Origin:
It is thought that the first Indian Jews were originated from Israel, having settled on the Malabar coast after the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in the
9th century B.C.E
This includes the Bene Israel, the Cochin Jews, and the Bnei Menashe.
Under British imperial rule:
Indian Jews prospered enormously, achieving heights in population and wealth. The Jewish population in British India peaked at around 20,000 - 50,000 in the mid-1940s.
Jewing emigration from India:
The rise of Indian nationalism that accompanied sovereignty made some Jews uncomfortable, as they identified more as British than Indian.
This, coupled with the creation of
the State of Israel in 1948
, saw many Jews leave India.
Despite such heavy Jewish emigration, Jews continued to play an active role in Indian life throughout the latter half of the 20th century.
Jewish community in India today:
India is home to
3 historically distinct Jewish communities:
the Bene Israel ("Sons of Israel"), the Cochin Jews, and the Baghdadi Jews, and is projected to comprise 4,000–5,000 people now.
Among these, almost all belong to the
Marathi-speaking Bene Israel community
, settled on the Konkan coast for hundreds of years.
However, the honour of being the
oldest
Jewish of India goes to one of
Kerala’s
two main Jewish communities (Malabar/ Cochin Jews).
The Jews of Kerala:
The oldest documentary evidence of this community (copper plates of the Cranganore’s Hindu ruler from circa 1,000 CE) lists various economic and ceremonial privileges that the Jews enjoyed in the region.
Following the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century, Malabar Jews moved further south
from Cranganore to Cochin
(now Kochi) where the local king welcomed them.
Paradesi/ foreign Jews:
They migrated to the Indian subcontinent in the 15th and 16th centuries from the
Iberian Peninsula
due to persecution by the Catholic rulers of Spain and Portugal.
They settled on the Malabar coast
alongside pre-settled Jewish communities, as well as in Madras (now Chennai).
The Paradesi Jews of Cochin were
active in Kerala’s spice trade
, and those settled in Madras were involved in the
trade of Golconda diamonds
and other precious stones.
Cultural evolution of Jews of Kerala:
The Paradesi Jews adopted Malayalam and many local customs and traditions.
However, they stopped marrying those from Kerala’s older Jewish community, and began to look down on them.
This effectively created two distinct Jewish communities in Kerala (Paradesis/ white Jews and the Malabaris/ black Jews). Although this characterisation is largely inaccurate.
In Cochin, the
Koders
were among the most prominent Paradesi Jewish families.
Unlike Jewish communities in Europe or West Asia, the ones in India seldom faced anti-Semitism or persecution.
However, there has been a
steady migration of Kerala
Jews to Israel since the 1950s. Only 14 Malabar Jews, and one Paradesi Jew are now left in Kerala.
The majority of Jews who emigrated from India made this decision based on the
influence of Zionism and a love for Israel
, rather than a disdain for India.

**********Adani Group and Hindenburg Report: A Saga of Controversy and Regulatory Scrutiny
Why in news?
A year and a half after its January 2023 report on the Adani Group, US-based short seller Hindenburg Research has levelled allegations against the chairperson of India’s capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
Hindenburg Research has accused Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband of having stakes in offshore funds involved in the alleged Adani money siphoning scandal.
The short seller (Hindenburg Research) seeks to draw a connection between the alleged involvement of two offshore funds, the Buchs' investments, and their various professional associations, suggesting that Ms. Buch may have shown favoritism toward the Adani Group.
What’s in today’s article?
Short selling
Background
Hindenburg’s new allegation
Stand taken by the SEBI on this controversy
About
Short selling involves profiting from a decline in a stock's price by selling borrowed shares and repurchasing them at a lower price.
Short selling can serve many purposes, such as mitigating demand-supply imbalances in scrips and ensuring price efficiency.
However, it has also been used as a means of manipulation — or what the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has described as a bear raid.
In this context, it raises concerns about intent and credibility.
Example
Anticipating a downward movement, an individual sells 10 shares at ₹100 apiece. The total sale value is ₹1,000.
The price of the share decreases to ₹85 apiece and they opt to buy the quantity back. This time it will cost them ₹850 — a direct profit of ₹150.
Hindenburg and short selling
Hindenburg had shorted electric truck maker Nikola Corp in 2020 placing concerns about their functionality.
In October 2022, the Nikola’s founder Trevor Milton was convicted by a U.S. jury of fraud for lying to investors about the technology.
Hindenburg report on Adani
In a January 2023 report, Hindenburg accused the Adani Group of decades-long stock manipulation and accounting fraud.
The report was released just before Adani Enterprises' Rs 20,000-crore follow-on public offer (FPO), leading to a sharp decline in Adani shares and the eventual cancellation of the fully subscribed FPO.
Adani denied the allegations, and most of the group's shares have since recovered.
Expert committee formed by SC to investigate
In March 2023, the Supreme Court formed a six-member expert committee to investigate potential regulatory failures concerning the Adani Group.
Separately, the court asked Sebi to specifically investigate if there was:
a violation of the minimum public shareholding norms in public limited companies,
a failure to disclose transactions with related parties, or
any manipulation of stock prices.
Observation made by SC
In May 2023, the expert committee reported that Sebi had found no evidence of money flow violations from offshore entities into Adani companies.
By November 2023, the court upheld Sebi's investigation, rejecting the need for a Special Investigation Team (SIT) or CBI involvement.
SEBI had completed 21 out of 22 probes by March 2024, with the final investigation nearing completion.
Hindenburg Research's allegations against SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband revolve around their supposed hidden stakes in offshore funds in Bermuda and Mauritius, which are linked to the Adani Group's alleged stock manipulation.
Hindenburg suggests a
conflict of interest and possible collusion
due to the Buchs' investments in these funds.
It asserted that this might explain SEBI's reluctance to take meaningful action in the ongoing Adani investigation.
The allegations also focus on Ms. Buch's professional engagements.
Hindenburg claims that she retained ownership of her consulting firm, Agora Partners Singapore, during her tenure at SEBI, only transferring it to her husband's name after becoming SEBI Chairperson.
Furthermore, Hindenburg accuses her husband of benefiting from his role as a senior advisor at Blackstone, alleging that SEBI's policy changes under Ms. Buch's leadership favored Blackstone's interests in India's real estate investment trusts (REITs).
Sebi defended Madhabi Puri Buch, stating that she has consistently made necessary disclosures regarding her securities holdings and transfers.
Sebi also noted that Buch has recused herself from cases involving potential conflicts of interest.
During the Hindenburg probe, Sebi has communicated with over 100 regulators and agencies and examined more than 300 documents.
They advised investors to stay calm and exercise due diligence.

**********The top court as custodian of liberties    
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Judiciary; Preventive detention; Civil liberties; Article 21;
Mains level:
Judiciary; Guarantee of Civil Liberties;
Why in the News?
Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was arrested in early 2023 by the CBI and ED in the Delhi liquor policy case. After nearly a year and a half in prison, the Supreme Court of India granted him bail, underscoring that bail should not be used as a form of punishment.
Previous judgments on the ‘Right to Speedy Trial’:
The Supreme Court referenced its earlier judgments, including
Kashmira Singh (1977), P. Chidambaram (2020),
Satender Kumar Antil (2022),
which establish that the
right to a speedy trial is fundamental under Article 21 of the Constitution.
The Court’s decision in
Arnab Manoranjan Goswami vs The State of Maharashtra and Ors. (2020)
was cited, reinforcing that
liberty is a core component of constitutionalism.
In recent scenario, the SC relied on its earlier order dated October 30, 2023, in
Manish Sisodia vs Central Bureau of Investigation,
which highlighted concerns about the
large volume of evidence (56,000 pages of documents and 456 witnesses) potentially causing significant delays in trial proceedings.
What are the present limitations?
Prolonged Incarceration:
The ruling pointed out that the
legal system often leads to excessive delays
, which can result in individuals being punished without trial.
Dependence on Prosecutorial Statements:
A concern was raised about the
reliance on the prosecution’s assurances regarding the timeline for trial completion.
‘Guarantee of Civil Liberties’:
Constitutional Foundation:
The Supreme Court emphasized that individual liberties should not be contingent on the discretion of the prosecution.
In judgments like
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)
, the Court expanded the understanding of due process, emphasising that any deprivation of liberty must follow fair, just, and reasonable procedures.
Judicial Responsibility:
The judgment aims to prevent the misuse of stringent laws like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and to uphold the dignity and rights of individuals.
Rana Ayyub v. Directorate of Enforcement (2023),
the Supreme Court emphasized judicial oversight in PMLA enforcement while
ensuring trials follow underlying offenses
Public’s trust on Judiciary:
Presently, the Apex Court pointed out the flawed tendency of some judges to deny bail unnecessarily, ignoring the principle of timely trials. This may lead to loss of public trust in the judiciary.
Call for Systemic Change:
The ruling urges a reevaluation of the political and legal systems to prioritize justice and individual rights over personal vendettas.
State of Maharashtra v. Rani Kusum (2005)
underscores the necessity for reforms to address delays in the judicial process.
Bail is the Rule, Not the Exception:
The Supreme Court’s decision in granting bail to Manish Sisodia reinforces the principle that bail is the rule, not the exception.
Way forward:
Adherence to procedural deadlines:
In this situation, courts should
enforce stricter adherence to procedural deadlines and prioritize cases
involving prolonged incarceration to safeguard the right to a speedy trial.
Independent oversight committees:
Need to establish
independent oversight committees to regularly review cases of prolonged incarceration without trial,
ensuring accountability and reducing reliance on prosecutorial assurances alone.

What was held in the Coelho case? In this context, can you say that judicial review is of key importance amongst the basic features of the Constitution?
