MALARIA
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
According to the World Malaria Report 2024 by WHO, the South East Asia Region contributes about 1.5% of global malaria cases, with India accounting for nearly half of all estimated cases in the region in 2023.
<img alt="" class="wp-image-200362 aligncenter" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="248" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/malaria-300x168.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/malaria-300x168.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/malaria.png 602w" width="443"/>
New data from the WHO revealed that an estimated 2.2 billion cases of malaria and 12.7 million deaths have been averted since 2000, but the disease remains a serious global health threat, particularly in the WHO African Region.
About Malaria
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
Not all Anopheles mosquitoes have malaria, but if they bite a person with malaria, they can become infectious.
People do not spread malaria to other people, like the common cold or the flu. Also, malaria is not sexually transmitted.
Because the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells, people can acatch malaria from exposure to infected blood, including:
From mother to unborn child
Through blood transfusions
By sharing needles used to inject drugs
Symptoms
Fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting.
Severe cases: Organ failure, cerebral malaria, or death.
Global Initiatives: WHO’s Global Technical Strategy for Malaria (2016-2030) aims to reduce global malaria cases by 90% by 2030.
India’s Measures:
National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP): Aims to eliminate malaria by 2030.
National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP): Comprehensive approach to combat mosquito-borne diseases.
Use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
Vaccination:
RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix): First malaria vaccine approved by WHO in 2021 for pilot projects in high-burden regions.

CLIMATE IMPACT OF EXPLORING SPACE
Mains – ENVIRONMENT
As the world becomes more reliant on space technology for vital functions like climate monitoring, the environmental consequences of space activities need more attention.  The rapid growth of the number of satellites in orbit has led to concerns about interference with climate monitoring systems and the accumulation of orbital debris.
Space activities currently fall outside international sustainability instruments like the Paris Agreement.
Key Concerns:
Climate Change:
Rocket emissions (CO2, black carbon, water vapor) contribute to global warming.
Chlorine-based propellants deplete the ozone layer.
Satellite re-entry and burn up releases metallic ash, potentially altering the atmosphere.
Energy-intensive satellite production and mining activities have significant carbon footprints.
Orbital Debris:
Rapid growth of satellites and debris poses collision risks to functional satellites.
Debris interferes with scientific observations and communication systems.
Increases the cost and complexity of space missions.
Poses a threat to human-crewed missions.
Challenges to Space Sustainability:
Lack of International Regulation:
No specific international regulations address space debris and environmental impact.
Technological Limitations:
Reusable rockets have limitations in terms of payload capacity and fuel efficiency.
Cleaner fuels like hydrogen and biofuels face challenges in production and storage.
Biodegradable satellite materials lack durability for space environments.
Autonomous debris removal technologies are expensive and require legal clarity.
International Cooperation:
Data sharing and coordination among nations are hindered by security and commercial concerns.
Path Towards Space Sustainability:
International cooperation through bodies like the Committee on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space (COPUOS) is necessary to create enforceable standards.
Standardize emission limits, debris mitigation, and data-sharing practices.
Technological Innovation:
Invest in research and development of cleaner fuels, biodegradable materials, and autonomous debris removal technologies.
Policy and Incentives:
Implement strict regulations and incentives for sustainable space practices.
Encourage public-private partnerships to accelerate technological advancements.
Establish a global space traffic management system to monitor and coordinate satellite activities.

EXPANSION OF UNIVERSE
Two years of data from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has corroborated the observation by Hubble Telescope that the universe is expanding more rapidly than expected.
The observations by Webb, the most capable space telescope ever deployed, appear to rule out the notion that the data from its forerunner Hubble was somehow flawed due to instrument error
Key takeaways
Data from James Webb Space Telescope have now validated the Hubble Space Telescope’s earlier finding that the rate of the universe’s expansion is faster — by about 8% — than would be expected based on what astrophysicists know of the initial conditions in the cosmos and its evolution over billions of years. The discrepancy is called the Hubble Tension.
According to scientists, the current understanding of the universe contains a lot of ignorance about two elements — dark matter and dark energy — and these make up 96% of the universe.
Dark matter, thought to comprise about 27% of the universe, is a hypothesised form of matter that is invisible but is inferred to exist based on its gravitational effects on ordinary matter – stars, planets, moons, all the stuff on Earth – which accounts for roughly 5% of the universe.
Dark energy, believed to comprise approximately 69% of the universe, is a hypothesised form of energy permeating vast swathes of space that counteracts gravity and drives the universe’s accelerating expansion.
More about Hubble Tension
Hubble Constant (H₀): Represents the rate of expansion of the universe, typically expressed in kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc)
Hubble Tension: Discrepancy between values of H₀ measured using different methods, challenging our understanding of cosmology.
About James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the most powerful space telescope ever built, designed to explore the universe in unprecedented detail.
Launch Date: JWST was launched on December 25, 2021.
Location: It orbits the Sun at the second Lagrange point (L2), about 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Earth.
Design and Features:
Sunshield: It has a 5-layer sunshield the size of a tennis court, which protects its instruments from the Sun’s heat and light.
Mirrors: JWST uses 18 hexagonal mirrors that unfold like a “Transformer” in space to form a single large mirror with a diameter of 6.5 meters (21 feet).
Scientific Instruments:
Instruments: JWST is equipped with four main instruments: Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and Fine Guidance Sensor/Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS/NIRISS).
Capabilities: These instruments allow JWST to observe the universe in infrared light, which can penetrate dust clouds and reveal objects that are too faint or distant for visible light telescopes.
Scientific Goals:
Early Universe: JWST aims to study the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang, providing insights into the early universe.
Planetary Systems: It will observe the atmospheres of exoplanets to search for signs of habitability and possibly life.
Star and Planet Formation: JWST will study the formation of stars and planets within dust clouds.

**********Pressuring the RBI to Lower the Interest Rate Is Not Going to Solve the Problem
Context
Recent remarks by India’s commerce and finance ministers
have reignited
the debate on the independence of RBI.
By
subtly suggesting that the central bank reconsider its stance on interest rates
, the ministers have
touched upon two critical issues:
the relationship between government and RBI policy and
the potential efficacy of monetary policy in addressing economic growth concerns.
Amid these developments, it is important to evaluate the issue of RBI autonomy, growth concerns,
RBI’s role and the ongoing debate on food inflation while considering their broader implications for the economy.
The Question of RBI Autonomy, Government’s Interference, and the Risks of Politicising Monetary Policy
The Role of Central Bank Autonomy
The autonomy of central banks
, such as the RBI,
is a cornerstone of effective monetary policy.
This
independence allows the RBI to make decisions based on technical analysis
and long-term economic considerations,
free from political pressures.
It
operates under a framework where the government sets broad policy goals
, such as the inflation target of 4 percent established in 2016,
but the execution of these goals is left to the RBI.
separation ensures that the central bank can focus on its core responsibilities
, particularly controlling inflation, without undue interference.
Government Interference and its Risks
When
government officials publicly suggest changes to the RBI’s policies
it can undermine this carefully maintained independence.
The commerce and finance ministers’ recent remarks on interest rates and inflation are examples of this tension.
Although framed as advice, these statements can be interpreted as an attempt to steer the RBI toward decisions that align with the government’s immediate priorities,
such as boosting economic growth.
encroachment risks compromising the RBI’s credibility as a neutral institution
, reducing confidence among investors and stakeholders in its ability to act independently.
The Risks of Politicising Monetary Policy
In this context,
the ministers’ suggestions
to exclude food inflation from the inflation index or to address credit availability by lowering interest rates
appear problematic.
These proposals, though potentially well-meaning
risk politicising the RBI’s policy
They
prioritise short-term growth concerns over the central bank’s long-term objective
of maintaining price stability.
Autonomy is not just a matter of process; it is essential for ensuring that monetary policy serves the broader and enduring interests of the economy
rather than immediate political considerations.
An Analysis of India’s Economic Growth Concerns and RBI’s Role
Growth Deceleration and Manufacturing Challenges
slowdown in India’s economic growth has sparked concerns within the government,
particularly due to its potential political and developmental implications.
While the economy recorded a stellar GDP growth rate of 8.2 percent in 2023-24
, this momentum appears to have weakened in the current fiscal year,
with growth in the first half of 2024-25 estimated at 6 percent.
manufacturing sector, a cornerstone of the government’s policy focus for over a decade, has seen a sharper decline in growth rates
—from 9.6 percent to 4.5 percent over the same period.
Oversimplifying Growth Dynamics
This deceleration has likely prompted the government to explore ways to sustain high growth rates, particularly in manufacturing, which is crucial for job creation and exports.
However,
the belief that the RBI’s monetary policy adjustments, such as lowering interest rates, can meaningfully reverse this trend oversimplifies the dynamics
of economic growth.
Growth is influenced by a combination of factors, including demand conditions, structural reforms, fiscal policy, and global economic trends.
The Limits of Monetary Policy
Monetary policy tools like interest rate adjustments primarily address supply-side issues,
such as borrowing costs for businesses.
Lowering interest rates can incentivise companies
to invest by reducing the cost of capital.
in the absence of strong demand signals, firms are unlikely to expand production or borrow more
, regardless of lower interest rates.
Businesses base investment decisions on anticipated sales, and if consumer demand remains weak, the expected returns on new investments will not justify additional borrowing.
Misdiagnosing the Economic Problem
Thus,
urging the RBI to cut interest rates as a solution to the current economic slowdown misdiagnoses the problem.
The issue is not a lack of liquidity or high borrowing costs but insufficient demand in the market.
Applying a supply-side solution to a demand-side problem is unlikely to yield the desired results.
Instead, addressing the structural issues, such as stagnant real wages and weak private consumption, is essential for restoring growth momentum.
The Debate on Food Inflation and Broader Implications of Ministers’ Comments
The commerce minister’s suggestion to exclude food prices from the inflation index is particularly contentious.
Food inflation, which exceeded 10 percent in October, directly affects consumer
High food costs reduce disposable income for non-essential goods, further slowing demand in sectors like manufacturing.
Removing food prices from the index would distort inflation
measurements without addressing the root causes of price increases.
Such a move might ease the government’s concerns
about meeting inflation targets
but would do little to solve either inflation or growth challenges.
ministers’ comments reflect growing anxiety
within the government about slowing economic momentum.
their proposed solutions risk diverting attention from more pressing structural issues,
such as stagnant wages and lagging private investment.
Instead of urging the RBI to lower interest rates,
the government should focus on stimulating demand through policies that enhance wage growth and boost consumer confidence.
Additionally,
tackling food inflation directly through agricultural reforms and supply-chain improvements would yield more meaningful results
than simply excluding it from the inflation index.
Way Forward:
Comprehensive Solutions for Demand Revival
The government’s focus on manufacturing growth is understandable, given its importance to long-term economic stability and employment generation.
overreliance on the RBI’s monetary policy to resolve what is fundamentally a demand-side issue risks diverting attention from the more comprehensive measures
Enhancing consumer purchasing power through targeted fiscal policies
, such as wage support programs, tax relief for lower-income groups, or direct income transfers,
could provide a more effective and sustainable boost to demand.
Conclusion
While the government’s concerns about growth are understandable,
its attempts to influence the RBI’s monetary policy are both inappropriate and misguided.
Furthermore,
addressing India’s current economic challenges requires a nuanced approach
that goes beyond monetary policy.
Policymakers must prioritise demand-side interventions,
such as boosting wages and curbing inflation, to achieve sustained and equitable growth.
A collaborative but independent relationship between the government and the RBI is essential
for navigating these complexities.

Editorial Analysis
**********Ghost gun
Why in news?
Luigi Mangione, the person suspected of the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was carrying a “ghost gun” when he was apprehended.
The police suspect Mangione’s gun may have been made using a 3D printer.
What’s in today’s article?
3D Printing
Ghost Gun
3D printing
Background
Invented in the 1980s, 3D printing burst into the mainstream around the 2010s.
The technology, however, at that time was expensive, slow and prone to making errors. In recent years, some of these flaws have been done away with, making 3D printing more prevalent than ever before.
About
3D printing, also known as
additive manufacturing
, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from digital models by adding material layer by layer.
It is an additive process, in which layers of a material like plastic, composites or bio-materials are built up to construct objects that range in shape, size, rigidity and colour.
This process allows for more efficient and customized production compared to traditional subtractive manufacturing methods.
Some notable examples
3D printing is being used in a host of different industries like healthcare, automobile and aerospace.
In May 2023, aerospace manufacturing company Relativity Space launched a test rocket made entirely from 3D-printed parts, measuring 100 feet tall and 7.5 feet wide.
Shortly after its take off, however, it suffered a failure.
At the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the healthcare industry
used 3D printers to make much-needed medical equipment, like swabs, face shields, and masks, as well as the parts to fix their ventilator
Ghost guns are untraceable firearms, often made using 3D printers and assembled from various parts, including metals and plastics.
These guns lack serial numbers, making them difficult for law enforcement to trace.
Kits for assembling such weapons were initially popular among hobbyists in the US, symbolizing libertarian ideals, but have now gained popularity among criminals due to their anonymity.
Concerns
The ease of creating ghost guns bypasses background checks required for commercial firearm sales.
This incident highlights the evolution of 3D printing technology and raises concerns about its misuse in crafting precision equipment like firearms.
A Growing Threat in the US
Untraceable and Increasingly Prevalent
Ghost guns, formally known as Privately Made Firearms (PMF), are becoming a significant problem in the US due to their untraceable nature.
Sharp Rise in Recoveries
In 2022, the US Department of Justice recovered 25,785 ghost guns, reflecting a staggering 1,300% increase since 2016.
Between 2017 and 2021, nearly 38,000 suspected ghost guns were recovered during domestic seizures.
Recent Trends
The number of ghost guns recovered and traced increased significantly.
19,273 in 2021, up from 8,504 in 2020, according to the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF).
Are ghost guns legal in the US?
Biden’s 2022 Rule for Ghost Guns
President Joe Biden introduced a rule in 2022 requiring ghost guns to adhere to the same regulations as commercial firearms.
The rule mandates serial numbers and background checks for buyers.
The measure faces legal challenges in the Supreme Court, with no final ruling yet.
Arguments Supporting Ghost Guns
Advocates claim ghost guns are for hobbyists and align with the Second Amendment, which protects the right to keep and bear arms.
Supporters argue individuals have a right to build firearms for personal use.
Existing Legal Framework
Gun Control Act of 1968
permits private citizens to construct guns for personal use without mandatory registration or traceability, provided they are not sold.

What’s in today’s article?
Key highlights of the WHO’s World Malaria Report 2024
India specific observations in the WHO’s World Malaria Report 2024
About
It is an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are spread to people through the bites of infected
female Anopheles mosquitoes
. It is a life-threatening disease primarily found in tropical countries.
It is preventable and curable.
Transmission of Malaria
Malaria is not contagious and cannot spread from one person to another; the
disease is transmitted through the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes
Five species of parasites
can cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species –
Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
– pose the greatest threat.
Global Burden (2023):
263 million cases and 597,000 deaths were reported globally.
African Region accounted for 95% of deaths, disproportionately affecting young children and pregnant women.
Global Progress Since 2000:
2.2 billion malaria cases and 12.7 million deaths were averted.
Case incidence dropped significantly, with steady improvements in many regions.
Certification of Malaria-Free Countries
As of November 2024,
WHO has certified 44 countries and one territory, including Egypt most recently, as malaria-free.
Certification requires three consecutive years of zero indigenous malaria cases.
25 malaria-endemic countries now report fewer than 10 cases annually, up from 4 in 2000.
Country-Specific Trends in Malaria Cases
Reduction in Cases (2022-2023):
Nepal (-58.3%), India (-9.6%), Bangladesh (-9.2%), and Indonesia (-5.7%).
Increases in Cases:
North Korea (+47.9%), Thailand (+46.4%), and Myanmar (+45.1%).
Timor-Leste and Bhutan reported zero indigenous malaria cases in 2023.
South-East Asia’s Contribution to Malaria Reduction
The WHO South-East Asia Region accounted for
1.
5% of global malaria cases in 2023
India contributing nearly half
and Indonesia about one-third.
Estimated malaria cases in the region dropped by 82.4%, from 22.8 million in 2000 to 4 million in 2023.
Malaria deaths in the region fell by 82.9%, from 35,000 in 2000 to 6,000 in 2023, with India and Indonesia accounting for 88% of these deaths.
Challenges
In Africa
Despite global progress, Africa remains the region most affected by malaria.
Funding and Systemic Challenges
Funding in 2023 reached $4 billion, far below the $8.3 billion target set by the Global Technical Strategy.
Insufficient funding resulted in gaps in insecticide-treated nets, medicines, and other critical tools.
Additional challenges include fragile health systems, weak surveillance, and threats such as drug and insecticide resistance.
Exacerbating factors include conflicts, natural disasters, climate change, and population displacement.
Recommendations for Equity and Innovation
Emphasis on robust data systems to monitor health inequities, with disaggregated data by sex, age, and social factors.
Advocacy for equity, gender equality, and human rights as foundational principles of anti-malaria innovation.
Engagement of affected communities in designing and evaluating new tools and approaches to combat malaria.
Call to Action
To sustain progress and address persistent challenges, the WHO urges increased investments, innovative approaches, and targeted action in high-burden regions, particularly in Africa.
India Exits HBHI Group: Milestone in Malaria Control
India has successfully reduced its malaria burden, exiting the High-Burden-High-Impact (HBHI) group of endemic countries.
country's malaria cases decreased by 69%,
from 6.4 million in 2017 to 2 million in 2023, and malaria deaths fell from 11,100 to 3,500 in the same period.
Key Strategies Behind India’s Success

**********Gene Therapy Success in India
Why in News?
Indian scientists have achieved a major milestone by using gene therapy
to treat severe Hemophilia A
, a rare genetic condition causing life-threatening bleeding episodes. This pioneering work, tested on five patients in Tamil Nadu, has shown promising results, with no bleeding episodes reported over an average follow-up period of 14 months.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is Gene Therapy?
Understanding Hemophilia A
The Promise of Gene Therapy
Global Context of Gene Therapy
Significance of the Gene Therapy Success in India
Conclusion
Human gene therapy
seeks to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene or to alter the biological properties of living cells
for therapeutic use.
It is used
to treat or cure disease including cancer, genetic diseases, and infectious diseases
Gene therapies can work by several mechanisms:
Replacing a disease-causing gene with a healthy copy of the gene.
Inactivating a disease-causing gene that is not functioning properly.
Introducing a new or modified gene into the body to help treat a disease.
There are a variety of types of gene therapy products
, including:
Plasmid DNA:
Circular DNA molecules can be genetically engineered to carry therapeutic genes into human cells.
Viral vectors:
Once viruses have been modified to remove their ability to cause infectious disease, these modified viruses can be used as vectors (vehicles) to carry therapeutic genes into human cells.
Bacterial vectors:
Bacteria can be modified to prevent them from causing infectious disease and then used as vectors (vehicles) to carry therapeutic genes into human tissues.
Human gene editing technology:
The goals of gene editing are to disrupt harmful genes or to repair mutated genes.
Patient-derived cellular gene therapy products:
Cells are removed from the patient, genetically modified (often using a viral vector) and then returned to the patient.
Understanding Hemophilia A:
What is Hemophilia?
It is a rare, inherited blood disorder that prevents blood from clotting properly.
can be classified
as minor or severe depending on the percentage of clotting factors present in those afflicted.
What is Hemophilia A?
Meaning:
It is a rare hereditary disorder caused by the absence of Factor VIII, a critical blood-clotting protein.
Severity:
Classified as minor or severe based on clotting factor levels; severe cases have less than 1% clotting factor.
Global context:
India has the world’s second-largest patient pool, estimated at 40,000-100,000.
Current treatments:
Frequent interventions:
Repeated Factor VIII infusions, monoclonal antibodies, or mimicking substances are used.
High costs:
Treatment costs in India are approximately ₹2.54 crore per patient over 10 years, making it inaccessible for many.
The Promise of Gene Therapy:
How does it work?
One-time solution:
Gene therapy introduces a functional gene that enables the body to produce sufficient Factor VIII, reducing or eliminating the need for repeated infusions.
Innovative technique used:
The Indian trial fused stem cells with the clotting factor gene using
lentivirus
(a safer vector compared to adenovirus), which eliminates the need for immunosuppressive drugs.
Results from the trial:
Patients:
Five individuals treated, with no bleeding episodes over 14 months.
Research team:
Led by Alok Srivastava from the Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore.
Support:
Funded by the Union Department of Biotechnology.
Global Context of Gene Therapy:
Roctavian:
Approved by the U.S. FDA in 2023, reducing bleeding incidents significantly in patients.
Mechanism:
Uses adenovirus vectors to deliver the therapeutic gene, requiring immune suppression.
Significance of the Gene Therapy Success in India:
Experts called the study “
ground-breaking
” due to:
Resource constraints:
Demonstrating the feasibility of conducting advanced gene therapy in a developing country.
Cost reduction:
Potential for localising gene therapy manufacturing in India, improving accessibility.
Broader access:
Overcoming barriers like immunosuppressive therapy and age limitations. This method may allow
younger patients
to receive treatment, overcoming challenges like liver maturity and health.
Conclusion:
The success of this gene therapy trial in India represents
a transformative step
in treating Hemophilia A, offering
a safer, more accessible, and effective solution
This breakthrough not only holds promise for India but also sets a global precedent for advancing medical care in resource-constrained settings.

Cause and significance of Vaikom Satyagraha;
Why in the News?
Over a century ago, the Vaikom Struggle broke caste barriers in Travancore, sparking mass movements for religious reform, inspiring Periyar’s Dravidian Movement, and advancing egalitarian principles within Hindu society.
What were the key motivations and outcomes of the Vaikom Satyagraha?
Motivations:
Social Inequality:
The primary motivation was to challenge the caste-based discrimination that prohibited backward caste Hindus from accessing streets near the Vaikom Mahadeva temple.
Demand for Equal Rights:
A call for equality and dignity for all castes within the Hindu religion.
Religious Reform:
The movement sought to highlight the need for social justice through religious reform and temple entry rights.
Political Awareness:
It aimed to bring political attention to caste discrimination and mobilize support for broader social changes.
Outcomes:
Immediate Impact:
The restrictions on backward castes from walking near the temple were lifted in 1925, marking a significant social reform milestone.
Mass Mobilization:
It became one of the first large-scale movements in South India that united people across caste and class lines.
Precedent for Temple Entry Movements:
The success of Vaikom inspired subsequent movements across India, including protests led by B.R. Ambedkar.
Legislative Reforms:
It influenced the introduction of laws like the Madras Temple Entry Authorization Act (1947), allowing all Hindus to enter temples.
Foundation for Social Justice Policies:
The movement set the stage for government interventions in temple management and appointments of priests from backward castes.
How did the leadership of the movement influence its success?
The success of the Vaikom Satyagraha can be attributed largely to its leadership. Key figures included
Periyar E.V. Ramasamy,
who played a crucial role in mobilising support across various social strata and employing nonviolent methods of protest. His involvement transformed the movement into a mass agitation that attracted participants from all classes.

**********Climate impact of exploring space passing below the radar
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related to space environment;
Why in the News?
The growing reliance on space technologies for climate monitoring highlights urgent environmental concerns, including
orbital debris
and
system interference,
necessitating swift international regulations to ensure sustainable space exploration practices.
How do Rockets affect the environment?
Emissions from Launches:
Every rocket launch releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide, black carbon, and water vapour into the atmosphere. Black carbon is particularly concerning as it absorbs sunlight much more effectively than carbon dioxide, exacerbating global warming.
Ozone Layer Depletion:
Rocket propellants, especially those containing chlorine-based chemicals, contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer at high altitudes. This increases ground-level exposure to ultraviolet radiation and disrupts atmospheric circulation, negatively impacting global climate.
Satellite Ash:
When satellites re-enter the atmosphere at the end of their missions, they burn up and release metallic ash into the middle layers of the atmosphere, which can harm the atmosphere and potentially alter climate patterns.
Manufacturing Footprint:
The production of satellites involves energy-intensive processes that have large carbon footprints due to the extraction and processing of metals and composite materials.
Space Mining Potential:
Future activities such as space mining could lead to increased industrial activity both in space and on Earth, further contributing to environmental impacts.
What are the Barriers to space sustainability?
Lack of Regulation:
Current space activities operate outside international sustainability frameworks like the Paris Agreement. There are no clear guidelines for emissions from rockets and satellites, allowing unchecked growth that contributes to global warming.
Overcrowding in Low Earth Orbit (LEO):
The increasing number of satellites and debris threatens to overcrowd LEO, making future missions more expensive and complicating access to space as a shared resource.
Need for International Cooperation:
Effective regulation requires collaboration through international bodies like the
Committee on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space (COPUOS)
to create enforceable standards for emissions and debris management.
Outdated Treaties:
Existing frameworks such as the
Outer Space Treaty
lack binding provisions that address environmental impacts, limiting their effectiveness in promoting responsible space use.
What would be the innovative solutions?
Reusable Rockets:
Developing reusable rockets can significantly reduce manufacturing waste and lower costs by allowing components to be used in multiple missions. However, these rockets may be heavier, increasing fuel consumption, and require costly refurbishments.
Cleaner Fuels:
Transitioning to cleaner fuels such as
liquid hydrogen or biofuels
can minimize harmful emissions during launches. However, current hydrogen production methods often rely on non-renewable energy sources, undermining its environmental benefits.
Biodegradable Satellites:
Designing satellites with biodegradable materials that disintegrate upon re-entry could help prevent long-term debris accumulation. However, these materials currently lack durability for space conditions and face high development costs.
Autonomous Debris Removal (ADR):
Technologies like
robotic arms
laser systems
show promise for cleaning up orbital debris but require significant investment and legal clarity before implementation.
Global Traffic Monitoring System:
Establishing a real-time monitoring system for satellites and debris could reduce collision risks and optimize orbital use. However, data-sharing concerns due to security and commercial interests hinder its development.
Way forward:
Establish Binding International Frameworks
: Governments should collaborate through COPUOS and other international platforms to create enforceable regulations for emissions, debris mitigation, and sustainable practices in space exploration.
Promote Innovation Through Incentives
: Public and private entities should prioritize funding for green technologies, such as cleaner fuels, biodegradable satellites, and debris removal systems. Financial incentives like subsidies, tax benefits, or penalties can accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices in the space sector.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Notifiable Diseases
Why in the News?
The
Union Health Ministry
has urged states to make snakebites a
, meaning both private and public hospitals must report it to the government.
Snakebites Menace in India:
Snakebites are a significant public health concern in India, with approximately
3 to 4 million
cases
reported annually.
It causes an estimated
58,000 deaths
every year, according to the
2020 Indian Million Death Study
States such as
Bihar
Jharkhand
Madhya Pradesh
Odisha
Uttar Pradesh
Andhra Pradesh
Telangana
Rajasthan
, and
Gujarat
report the highest number of snakebites.
National Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Snakebite Envenoming (NAPSE)
, launched by the government earlier in 2024, aims to halve snakebite deaths by
2030
and includes making snakebites notifiable.
What are Notifiable Diseases?
Notifiable diseases are those that must be
reported to the government
for effective public health monitoring and management. These are typically:
Infectious diseases
likely to cause outbreaks.
Diseases that result in
or require
quick action
to prevent wider transmission.
Legal Basis:
According to
WHO’s International Health Regulations, 1969
, disease reporting is mandatory for global surveillance.
The primary law governing notifiable diseases is the
Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897
which outlines the reporting requirements for diseases considered a public health threat.
However, the
specific list
of notifiable diseases
can vary across different states
and is typically
determined by the respective state governments
under their individual public health acts.
Common examples of notifiable diseases include
tuberculosis
HIV
cholera
malaria
dengue
hepatitis
Why snakebite is considered a Notifiable Disease?
Snakebites can cause
severe health issues
, including paralysis, fatal hemorrhages, and tissue damage, making it crucial for timely intervention.
Victims need
immediate antivenom
treatment to prevent death and long-term effects.
2009
added snakebite to its list of
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD)
, acknowledging its widespread impact on public health.
Making snakebites a notifiable disease will enhance
, help track
case numbers
, and improve
strategies across the country.
It will ensure the
availability of adequate antivenoms
in regions where snakebites are frequent.
Medical staff will receive
training
to handle snakebite cases effectively, reducing mortality rates.
