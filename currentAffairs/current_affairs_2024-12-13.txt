PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT
Syllabus:
Mains – POLITY & ETHICS
Context:
The comments made by Allahabad High Court judge, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, against the Muslim community at an event organised by the legal cell of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has drawn public flak.
Background: –
The “Restatement of Values of Judicial Life” and “Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct 2002” presents ethical framework for  judicial conduct.
Key takeaways
The ‘Restatement of Values of Judicial Life’ is the primary code of ethics governing judicial behaviour adopted by the Supreme Court in 1997.
The code comprises 16 points:
Justice must not merely be done but it must also be seen to be done. Members of the judiciary must reaffirm the people’s faith in the impartiality of the judiciary. Accordingly, any act of a judge of the Supreme Court or a high court, whether in official or personal capacity, which erodes the credibility of this perception, has to be avoided.
A judge should not contest the election to any office of a club, society or other association.
Close association with individual members of the bar, particularly those who practice in the same court, shall be eschewed.
A judge should not permit any member of his immediate family, if a member of the Bar, to appear before him or even be associated in any manner with a cause to be dealt with by him.
No member of his family, who is a member of the Bar, shall be permitted to use the residence in which the judge actually resides or other facilities for professional work.
A judge should practice a degree of aloofness consistent with the dignity of his office.
A judge shall not hear and decide a matter in which a member of his family, a close relation or a friend is concerned.
A judge shall not enter into public debate or express his views in public on political matters or on matters that are pending or are likely to arise for judicial determination.
A judge is expected to let his judgments speak for themselves. He shall not give interviews to the media.
A judge shall not accept gifts or hospitality except from his family, close relations and friends.
A judge shall not hear and decide a matter in which a company in which he holds shares is concerned unless he has disclosed his interest and no objection to his hearing and deciding the matter is raised.
A judge shall not speculate in shares, stocks or the like.
A judge should not engage directly or indirectly in trade or business, either by himself or in association with any other person.
A judge should not ask for, accept contributions or otherwise actively associate himself with the raising of any fund for any purpose.
A judge should not seek any financial benefit in the form of a perquisite or privilege attached to his office unless it is clearly available.
Every judge must at all times be conscious that he is under the public gaze and there should be no act or omission by him which is unbecoming of the high office he occupies and the public esteem in which that office is held.
About the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, 2002
Adoption: Drafted under the guidance of the United Nations, the principles were formally adopted at a judicial colloquium in Bangalore, India, in 2002.
It is a set of universal principles and not legally binding but serves as a reference guide for judiciaries worldwide.
Six Core Values:
Independence:
Judges must ensure independence from executive, legislative, and other external influences.
Judicial independence is a precondition for the rule of law.
Impartiality:
Judges must remain unbiased in all cases, both in conduct and perception.
They must avoid conflicts of interest or favoritism.
Integrity: Upholding honesty and moral uprightness is fundamental for judicial trustworthiness.
Propriety: Judges must maintain propriety in personal and professional conduct, avoiding behavior that diminishes public confidence.
Equality: Fair treatment must be ensured regardless of race, gender, religion, or socio-economic background.
Competence and Diligence: Judges must continuously update their legal knowledge and ensure efficient case management.

VAIKOM SATYAGRAHA
Prelims – HISTORY
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his Tamil Nadu counterpart, M.K. Stalin, came together at Vaikom in Kottayam district of Kerala to inaugurate the renovated memorial to Tamil reformist leader E.V. Ramasamy Naicker, fondly known as Thanthai Periyar.
The programme marks the valedictory function of the centenary celebrations of the Vaikom Satyagraha in which Periyar E V Ramasamy Naicker actively participated.
The Vaikom Satyagraha was a significant social reform movement in Kerala that aimed to challenge the practice of untouchability and secure temple entry rights for all, irrespective of caste.
Location: Vaikom, a town in present-day Kottayam district, Kerala.
Issue: The temple roads around the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple were restricted for use by upper-caste Hindus, denying access to lower-caste communities.
Larger Aim: Address caste-based discrimination and ensure equal rights in public spaces.
Key Events:
Start of the Movement (March 30, 1924):
Led by leaders of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) movement inspired by Sree Narayana Guru’s philosophy of “One Caste, One Religion, One God for Man.”
Organized by leaders such as T.K. Madhavan, K. Kelappan, and A.K. Gopalan with support from the Indian National Congress.
Participation of Mahatma Gandhi: Gandhi advised the satyagrahis to adopt non-violence and resolve the issue through negotiations and public awareness.
Resolution: After prolonged protests, dialogues, and arrests of satyagrahis, partial success was achieved in 1925, with the opening of three out of four roads  (except the eastern road) surrounding the temple to people of all castes.
Only in 1936, after the Temple Entry Proclamation, was access to the eastern road and entry into the temple allowed to the lower castes.

DISEASE X
– SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
The recent outbreak reported in the first week of December 2024 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has claimed over 400 lives and remains unclassified, has raised concerns that it could be an instance of Disease X.
While investigations continue to determine the cause in Congo, the outbreak underscores the importance of Disease X.
Key Concerns:
Disease X is not an actual but a hypothetical disease or in other words, disease X is not a specific illness but a placeholder for an unpredictable and as-yet-undiscovered pathogen capable of sparking a global health crisis.
The World Health Organization (WHO) coined the term in 2018.
It was conceptualised by the WHO to prepare for future outbreaks that are difficult to predict or identify.
COVID-19 is widely regarded as the first instance of a real Disease X. When SARS-CoV-2 emerged as an unknown pathogen causing a global pandemic, it exemplified the scenario that Disease X was meant to represent — an unpredictable, novel threat requiring rapid global response and adaptation.
Forecasting the next Disease X is daunting, as its emergence depends on numerous unpredictable factors. Zoonotic diseases are the most likely source, given their history of driving major epidemics. However, other scenarios, such as pathogens mutating to evade treatment, laboratory mishaps, or deliberate biological attacks, cannot be ruled out.

BEIJING’S WAR AGAINST AIR POLLUTION
Mains – GS 2 & GS 3
Beijing, with a yearly average air quality index (AQI) of 144, was as polluted in 2015 as Delhi is today (Delhi’s average is 155 for 2024). But in the interim, Beijing has managed to cut its pollution level by one-third with the most significant fall spanning between 2013 and 2017.
Beijing is the capital of an emerging economy, as is Delhi. So, if Beijing could manage what it did at its stage of development, Delhi could and needs to, as well.
Similarities between Beijing and Delhi:
Rapid Urbanization and Economic Growth: Both cities have experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization, leading to increased emissions.
Heavy Reliance on Fossil Fuels: Both cities heavily rely on fossil fuels for energy generation and transportation, contributing to air pollution.
Regional Impact: Both cities are influenced by regional pollution sources, particularly during winter months.
Beijing’s Successful Strategies:
Long-Term Planning and Implementation: Beijing’s 20-year anti-pollution programme can be divided into three phases — 1998-2008; 2009-12; 2013-17. It was not shock-and-awe approach but a careful and slowly built-up plan with people’s participation, run by the local government of Beijing.
Targeted Pollution Sources: Sources of pollution in Beijing were broadly identified as energy structures and coal combustion, transportation structures, and construction and industrial structures.
For the first source, three steps were taken — ultra-low emission renovation and clean energy alternatives in power plants, renovation of coal-fired boilers, and elimination of coal consumption used for residential heating.
For transportation infrastructure, the government first retrofitted cars and public service vehicles with diesel particulate filters (DPF) and gradually tightened emission standards. Then it went for scrapping, through subsidies. Subway and bus infrastructure was overhauled and expanded along with optimising the urban layout.
As for the industrial and construction activities, tightening environmental requirements, intensifying end-of-pipe (EOP) treatment, eliminating obsolete industrial capacity, creating a green construction management model, efficient washing facilities, and implementing video monitoring with penal action against violators were some steps taken.
The last leg of the plan (2013-17) especially focused on the need for regional cooperation, with five adjoining provinces around Beijing coming together for reducing pollution in the region.
Lessons for Delhi:
Strong Political Will and Leadership: A strong commitment from the government is crucial to implement and enforce effective policies.
Since private transport is a big contributor to pollution, an efficient and comfortable bus-metro integrated transport system needs to be in place. Delhi’s DTC bus fleet is not only old but also inadequate for population size. The metro has almost zero last-mile connectivity.
Old vehicles need to be scrapped at the earliest through a well-thought-out subsidy-for-scrap programme.
Exclusive cycling and walking lanes should be built. Other ideas, such as cross-subsidisation through affordable public transport and expensive private transport using congestion or high parking charges, as well as separate fuel costs for the two modes of transport, could be experimented with.
An urban layout is needed where places of work and residence are brought closer, alleviating the need for long travel.
Delhi’s electricity is supplied primarily through coal fired plants. This need overhaul both from supply and demand side. Subsiding solar roof tops and connecting it to the grid with electricity bill discounts could be one step.
Much like the Beijing plan, Delhi needs to coordinate with neighbouring regions to control other sources which originate in these regions.

CESS AND SURCHARGE
Prelims – ECONOMY
Arvind Panagariya, Chairman, 16th Finance Commission, termed the grievance of States regarding the Centre’s increasing reliance on cesses and surcharges as a “complicated issue.”
While it was a worrisome factor for many States, it was also, “in a way,” the Centre’s response to the reduction of its own fiscal space due to the increase in the share of States in the divisible tax pool over the years, Aravind Panagariya said.
Cess
Definition: A cess is a tax levied by the government for a specific purpose, such as education, health, or infrastructure development.
Key Features:
Earmarked Purpose: The revenue collected from a cess is meant to be used exclusively for the purpose for which it is levied (e.g., Education Cess for funding education).
Temporary Nature: Cess is usually imposed for a limited duration until the specific purpose is fulfilled.
No Sharing with States: Unlike regular taxes under divisible pool arrangements, cess collections are not shared with states; the Union government retains the entire amount.
Article 270 of the Constitution allows cess to be excluded from the purview of the divisible pool of taxes that the Union government must share with the States.
Examples of Cess:
Health and Education Cess
Infrastructure Cess
Surcharge
Definition: A surcharge is an additional charge or tax applied on an existing tax.It is usually imposed on individuals/entities earning higher income or engaging in certain high-value transactions.
No Earmarked Purpose: Unlike cess, the revenue from surcharge can be used for any purpose as deemed fit by the government.
Progressive Taxation Tool: Surcharges target high-income groups or high-value transactions, promoting equity in taxation.
No Sharing with States: The revenue from surcharge is entirely retained by the Union government.
Examples of Surcharge:
Surcharge on Income Tax for individuals earning above ₹50 lakh.
Constitutional Provision: Empowered by Article 271 of the Constitution.

**********The Missing Spotlight on Urban Local Government Elections
Context
Urban Local Governments (ULGs) are essential components of India’s democratic framework,
responsible for delivering civic services and ensuring quality of life for citizens.
introduction of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (CAA) in 1992 was a milestone
in codifying the role of
ULGs as decentralised units of local self-governance.
Therefore,
it is important to examine the challenges of ULG elections, their significance in the broader democratic process
, and the urgent
need for reforms to strengthen local governance.
ULGs and the Concept of Simultaneous Elections (ONOE)
The Socio-Economic Importance of ULGs
India’s urban centres play a pivotal role in its socio-economic fabric
, with over 4,800 ULGs serving nearly 40% of the population—a figure projected to exceed 50% by 2050.
These
ULGs contribute over 60% to the nation’s GDP
, making their efficient governance indispensable for sustaining economic growth and societal development.
Given their importance, t
he synchronization of ULG elections with national and state elections could ensure that governance at all levels is streamlined and cohesive.
Introduction of One Nation One Election (ONOE)
This proposal is
aimed at synchronising elections for various legislative bodies to reduce administrative costs
, voter fatigue, and election-related disruptions.
While the discourse around ONOE has primarily focused on aligning the elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies.
inclusion of ULG elections in this framework has received limited attention.
Advantages of Synchronising ULG Elections
Including ULG elections in the ONOE framework has several potential benefits.
First,
synchronised elections could reduce the financial and administrative burden
of conducting frequent electoral exercises.
Second,
they could minimise the interruptions caused by staggered election schedules,
enabling continuous governance and development activities.
Third,
aligning ULG elections with state and national elections might increase voter turnout by leveraging the momentum of larger electoral campaigns
, thereby enhancing citizen participation at the grassroots level.
An Analysis of Historical Exclusion of ULGs and Shift in Perspective
ULGs as State Subjects and Historical Exclusions
Historically,
ULG elections have been treated as distinct from state and national elections due to their status as State subjects
under the Indian Constitution.
Reports such as the 79th report of the
Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice (2015), the NITI Aayog’s discussion paper on simultaneous elections (2017), and the Law Commission of India’s draft report (2018) have excluded ULGs from ONOE deliberations
, citing logistical challenges and the sheer number of ULGs in India.
The argument presented was that aligning elections for thousands of ULGs alongside national and state elections would be impractical and overly complex.
A Shift in Perspective by the High-Level Committee (HLC)
However,
the High-Level Committee (HLC) on simultaneous elections has taken a more inclusive stance.
Recognising the critical role of ULGs in governance,
the HLC proposed that local body elections be synchronized within 100 days of Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections
This recommendation reflects an understanding of the need for a holistic approach to electoral reforms, encompassing all tiers of government.
Challenges Surrounding ULGs and Disempowerment of State Election Commissions
Delays in ULG Elections
The magnitude of these delays is striking.
According to a 2024 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, elections were delayed
in over
60% of ULGs across the country.
In many cases,
these delays span several years
, leaving ULGs without democratically elected representatives.
Instead,
these bodies remain under the administrative control of State governments,
which violates the spirit of local self-governance enshrined in the CAA.
challenges of ULG elections are compounded by the disempowerment of State Election Commissions (SECs),
the constitutional bodies tasked with supervising and conducting these elections.
Only a few States have empowered their SECs to conduct critical functions
such as ward delimitation.
lack of autonomy often results in delays due to political interference
, incomplete delimitation processes, or disputes over reservations.
Given the high stakes involved in delimitation and reservations, these tasks should be entrusted to independent and empowered SECs
to ensure transparency and efficiency.
Broader Implications of Delayed ULG Elections
Administrative Inefficiency
procedural inefficiencies and lack of capacity within State Election Commissions (SECs)
exacerbate delays.
For instance,
delays in ward delimitation and reservation exercises, often carried out by State governments, prevent the timely announcement
of election schedules.
Political Interference
State governments often delay elections to ULGs for political gain
, either to consolidate power or to avoid elections during unfavourable political climates.
manipulation undermines the autonomy of ULGs and compromises
their ability
to function effectively.
Citizen Disengagement
absence of regular elections alienates citizens
from the democratic process.
When elections are delayed,
the public loses trust in the system, leading to reduced civic participation
and engagement in governance.
Necessary Measures to Address the Challenges of Delayed ULG Elections
Empowering SECs
and Strict Enforcement of Timelines
State Election Commissions must be given greater autonomy
and resources to conduct timely elections.
This includes enabling them to carry out ward delimitation
and reservation exercises independently, reducing reliance on State governments.
constitutional mandate for holding ULG elections every five years must be enforced strictly,
with penalties for unwarranted delays.
judiciary can also play a proactive role
in ensuring adherence to these timelines.
Decentralised Governance
and Integration into Broader Electoral Reforms
Strengthening the operational capacity of ULGs
and promoting citizen participation in governance
can mitigate the negative impacts of delays.
Regular elections are essential to empower local representatives
and enable them to address urban challenges effectively.
discussion on simultaneous elections provides an opportunity to address the issue of ULG election delays.
By aligning ULG elections with national and state elections, the logistical and administrative challenges can be streamlined, reducing the scope for delays.
Conclusion
The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act
envisioned ULGs as the
bedrock of decentralised governance.
persistent delays in elections, disempowered SECs
, and administrative roadblocks have
hindered their functioning.
As India moves towards synchronising elections at various levels,
it is imperative to include ULG elections in these reforms.

**********What India can learn from China’s war against air pollution
Why in news?
In 2015, Beijing's yearly average AQI was 144, comparable to Delhi's current average of 155 in 2024. Since then, Beijing has reduced its pollution levels by one-third, with the most significant improvements occurring between 2013 and 2017.
This progress was built on the foundation of a pollution control programme initiated in 1998, culminating in an aggressive phase referred to as a "war against air pollution."
What’s in today’s article?
Why Beijing holds significance for Delhi in war against air pollution?
Steps taken by Beijing to control its air pollution
What can Delhi learn from the Beijing experience?
Beijing's success in tackling air pollution serves as a model for Delhi, which faces similar challenges, particularly during winter.
Beijing is the capital of an emerging economy, as is Delhi. So, if Beijing could manage what it did at its stage of development, Delhi could and needs to, as well.
Like Beijing in 2013, Delhi's pollution is significantly influenced by regional contributions from neighboring states.
While controlling local emissions is essential, a coordinated effort across the entire NCR region is crucial to effectively combat air pollution.
Beijing's Pollution Challenge: A Gradual Response
With rapid economic growth and urbanization by the late 1990s, Beijing faced escalating air pollution due to increased energy consumption, heavily coal-dependent heating, and industrial emissions.
Three-Phase Anti-Pollution Programme (1998-2017):
Beijing implemented a phased, carefully planned anti-pollution strategy involving public participation and local government autonomy.
Energy and Coal Combustion Control
Ultra-low emission renovation in power plants.
Replacement of coal-fired boilers with cleaner alternatives.
Elimination of residential coal use for heating.
Transportation Infrastructure Overhaul
Retrofit of vehicles with diesel particulate filters (DPF).
Gradual scrapping of high-polluting vehicles with subsidies.
Expansion of subway and bus networks and urban layout optimization.
Industrial and Construction Regulation
Stricter environmental requirements and end-of-pipe (EOP) treatment.
Elimination of outdated industrial capacities.
Green construction management, advanced washing facilities, and video monitoring with penalties for violations.
Regional Cooperation for Success (2013-2017)
The final phase emphasized collaboration with five neighboring provinces, leading to a significant reduction in pollution levels through a collective regional effort.
Achievements - Significant Reduction in Key Pollutants (2013-2017)
Beijing's targeted anti-pollution strategy led to substantial declines in major pollutants: sulphur dioxide (83%), nitrogen oxide (43%), volatile organic compounds (42%), and PM2.5 (59%).
Tackling pollution at its sources reduced multiple pollutants simultaneously.
Critical Role of Financial Investment
A pivotal factor in Beijing's success was the government's substantial financial commitment.
Investments in pollution control surged six-fold within four years, funding the detailed and multi-faceted strategies essential for achieving the desired outcomes.
Ideas related to transportation
Implementing an efficient bus-metro integrated transport system, upgrading the DTC bus fleet, and improving last-mile connectivity.
Scrapping old vehicles through a subsidy-for-scrap program and creating exclusive cycling and walking lanes.
Experimenting with congestion charges, high parking fees, and separate fuel costs to promote public transport and reduce private vehicle use.
Developing an urban layout that brings workplaces and residences closer to minimize long-distance travel.
Energy Overhaul for Cleaner Air
Delhi’s electricity grid, still primarily coal-dependent, needs restructuring.
Subsidies for solar rooftops and grid integration, along with electricity bill discounts, could promote cleaner energy alternatives.
Regional Cooperation for Pollution Control
Coordination with neighboring regions is crucial, as pollution sources often originate beyond Delhi.
A collective effort to reduce regional pollution could benefit all involved.
Public Awareness and Accountability
Delhi’s residents must demand clean air and hold the government accountable, instead of tolerating poor air quality.
Changing the attitude towards air pollution could pressure authorities to take action.
Political Will and Government Accountability
The lack of political will is hindering progress in pollution control. Despite years of worsening air quality, the government continues to blame each other while providing insufficient solutions.
The public, especially the disadvantaged, is left to cope with the problem.
Delhi deserves a more serious and effective response from both the Centre and the State.

**********Supreme Court's Proceedings on the Places of Worship Act, 1991
Why in news?
The Supreme Court barred civil courts from registering fresh suits challenging the ownership or title of any place of worship and from ordering surveys of disputed religious sites until further orders.
Pending suits were also restricted from issuing "effective" interim or final orders, including surveys, until the next hearing on February 17, 2025.
What’s in today’s article?
Background of the case
Core question before the SC and the previous rulings on the issue
December 2024 Ruling – key directions by the SC
Historical Context
Passed during the Ram janmabhoomi movement in the late 1980s, which aimed to build a Ram temple at the Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya.
Concerned about potential similar movements and litigation, the PV Narasimha Rao-led government enacted the law to prevent future disputes.
Objective of the Act
Prohibit conversion of any place of worship to maintain its religious character as it existed on August 15, 1947.
Prevent conversion both within a religion (e.g., from one denomination to another) and between religions.
Structure:
The Act comprises seven sections:
Sections 1 & 2
: Title and definitions.
Section 3
: Bars conversion of places of worship.
Section 4
: Declares the religious character of places of worship and bars court jurisdiction.
Section 5
: Excludes Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid from its provisions.
Legal Provisions
Sections 4(1):
Declares that the religious character of a place of worship as of August 15, 1947, must be maintained.
Section 4(2):
Existing suits:
Legal proceedings related to the conversion of a place of worship’s religious character, pending before a court on August 15, 1947, shall abate.
Fresh suits:
New legal proceedings on such matters cannot be instituted.
Exception:
Suits or appeals regarding conversions occurring after the cut-off date (August 15, 1947) can continue.
Exceptions to Section 4
: The following are exceptions where the provisions of Section 4 do not apply:
Protected Sites
: Places classified as ancient monuments or archaeological sites under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act.
Resolved Legal Cases
: Cases or appeals already decided, resolved, or settled before the Act came into effect.
Mutual Settlements:
Disputes where parties settled the matter before the Act’s commencement.
Change by Acquiescence
: Places of worship whose religious character was altered by mutual agreement.
Time-Barred Cases
: Conversion cases that occurred before the Act and cannot be challenged due to the expiration of the time limit under existing laws.
Case before the court
The present case is related to the petitions challenging the Constitutional validity of Places of Worship Act, 1991.
The petitioners had challenged the Act on two grounds:
It bars judicial review, which is a basic feature of the Constitution,
It imposes an arbitrary irrational retrospective cutoff date and abridges the right to religion of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs.
Timeline
Core question before the SC and pervious ruling on the issue
Core Question Before the Supreme Court
Can district courts hearing civil suits on title or ownership of places of worship effectively undermine the purpose of the 1991 Places of Worship Act, which aims to resolve such disputes?
2022 Supreme Court Observations
The Supreme Court previously ruled that
surveying a place of worship does not inherently violate the 1991 Act
A three-judge bench led by then CJI DY Chandrachud examined the interplay of religious identities in places of worship, highlighting "hybrid character" scenarios, such as the coexistence of Zoroastrian and Christian religious symbols in the same complex.
The bench clarified it would not opine on whether ascertaining the religious character of a place violates Sections 3 and 4 of the Act.
Ayodhya Verdict and Its Relevance
Supreme Court recognized the Places of Worship Act as part of the Constitution's basic structure.
The Act was viewed as crucial for preserving secularism and ensuring the protection of religious sites as they existed on August 15, 1947.
The verdict recognized that historical wrongs cannot justify actions that disturb the present and future, emphasizing the Act's role in healing past wounds and ensuring communal harmony.
Key Directions from the Bench
The Supreme Court emphasized that while fresh suits may be filed, no action will be taken on them, nor will ongoing proceedings progress.
Directed the Union Government to clarify its position on the constitutional validity of the Act within four weeks.
Key observations made
The Supreme Court noted that issues regarding the constitutional validity, scope, and ambit of the Act require detailed examination.
Highlighted that lower civil courts must defer to principles laid out in the Ayodhya judgment, stating, “Civil courts cannot race with the Supreme Court.”
Larger constitutional questions
SC noted that even without the Act, constitutional principles might bar suits seeking to alter the religious character of places of worship.
It acknowledged petitions questioning whether the Act restricts judicial review powers, adding another layer of constitutional scrutiny.

**********What is Disease X And Why the World Should Prepare For It?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (About Disease X, Origin, etc.)
Epidemiological Patterns (Challenges, Global Preparedness, Need, Lessons, Conclusion)
Introduction to Disease X:
Disease X represents a hypothetical, yet highly probable, global health threat.
Coined by the
World Health Organization
(WHO) in 2018, the term is a
placeholder for any unknown pathogen capable of causing a devastating epidemic or pandemic
Recent outbreaks, such as the unclassified one in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that claimed over 400 lives, highlight the urgent need for preparedness against such threats.
Origins of the Concept:
The term
"Disease X" emerged after the West African Ebola epidemic
(2014–2016), which exposed gaps in global epidemic readiness.
It embodies "
known unknowns
" (threats we are aware of but lack specifics) and "
unknown unknowns
" (threats beyond our awareness).
The concept underscores the inevitability of new pathogens and emphasizes proactive preparation.
Epidemiological Patterns:
Since 1940, over 300 emerging infectious diseases have been identified, with 70% having zoonotic origins (transmitted from animals to humans).
Human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and climate change exacerbate these risks, bringing wildlife and humans into closer contact.
Regions with high biodiversity and limited healthcare infrastructure, such as the Congo Basin, are particularly vulnerable.
Challenges in Prediction:
Predicting Disease X is challenging due to:
The vast number of undiscovered pathogens.
Increasing zoonotic spillovers driven by human encroachment.
Climate change altering disease dynamics and expanding vectors like malaria and dengue.
Risks from antimicrobial resistance, bioterrorism, and accidental lab leaks.
Advancements in genomic sequencing and artificial intelligence offer hope but remain limited in their ability to predict the exact origin, timing, or behaviour of unknown pathogens.
Global Preparedness and WHO’s Priority List:
The WHO's priority pathogen list includes diseases like
Marburg
Nipah
This list aims to direct global research, funding, and policy efforts toward combating high-risk diseases with limited medical countermeasures.
Measures for Preparedness:
Strengthening Surveillance
: Robust systems for early outbreak detection are critical. Technologies like genomic sequencing and real-time data sharing play pivotal roles.
Healthcare Infrastructure
: Low- and middle-income countries require enhanced healthcare systems to mitigate the disproportionate impact of pandemics.
Rapid Response Platforms
: Organizations like the
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations
(CEPI) are developing "prototype pathogen" platforms to create vaccines within 100 days of identifying a new disease.
CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines against future epidemics.
Need for Global Collaboration:
Pandemics transcend borders, necessitating unified global efforts:
WHO Initiatives
: Efforts like the Pandemic Treaty aim to standardize global responses.
Equitable Access
: Frameworks like the Nagoya Protocol ensure fair distribution of resources and medical countermeasures.
International Cooperation
: Governments must share data, pool resources, and collaborate on diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines.
Lessons from Recent Outbreaks:
The outbreak in the DRC is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by Disease X.
Proactive investment in research, public health systems, and international solidarity can mitigate the devastating consequences of future pandemics.
Conclusion:
Disease X serves as a call to action for the global community.
Preparedness is not an option but a necessity to safeguard future generations.
By prioritizing collaboration, innovation, and robust health systems, humanity can confront and contain the unpredictable threats of emerging diseases.

**********Beijing’s War Against Air Pollution
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Air Pollution; Climate Change; Urbanization and it’s Challenges;
Why in the News?
In 2015, Beijing had an annual average Air Quality Index (AQI) of 144, comparable to Delhi’s current average of 155 in 2024. However, Beijing has since achieved a one-third reduction in its pollution levels, with the most notable decline occurring between 2013 and 2017.
Why discuss Beijing in the context of Delhi?
The comparison between Beijing and Delhi is significant due to their shared status as capitals of emerging economies facing severe air pollution challenges.
Similar Pollution Levels:
In 2015, Beijing had an average AQI of 144, comparable to Delhi’s current average of 155 for 2024. This similarity highlights the potential for improvement in Delhi, as Beijing has successfully reduced its pollution levels significantly since then.
Common Sources of Pollution:
Both cities experience high pollution from similar sources, including vehicular emissions, coal combustion, and industrial activities. The regional contributions to air quality issues are also significant in both cases, particularly during winter months.
Need for Collective Action:
Just as Beijing required a coordinated effort across its region to combat pollution, Delhi must engage neighboring areas in a collective strategy to effectively address its air quality crisis.
What did Beijing do and how did it achieve it?
Phased and Strategic Planning:
Implemented a 20-year anti-pollution programme in three phases (1998-2017) with local government autonomy and public participation to ensure gradual and sustainable progress.
1998-2008: Initial groundwork.
2009-2012: Strengthening regulations.
2013-2017: Aggressive measures termed the “war against air pollution.
Energy Sector Transition:
Shifted from coal to cleaner energy by renovating power plants, eliminating coal boilers, and replacing residential coal heating, reducing major emissions.
Transportation Reforms:
Upgraded public transport infrastructure, introduced emission controls in vehicles, and phased out polluting vehicles with subsidies, reducing transportation-based pollutants.
Regional Collaboration and Investment:
Partnered with five neighboring provinces for coordinated pollution control and increased financial investment sixfold to implement targeted measures effectively.
Financial Investment:
A sixfold increase in investment over four years supported these initiatives, allowing for significant infrastructure improvements and regulatory enforcement.
As a result of these efforts, major pollutants like sulfur dioxide and PM2.5 saw significant reductions (e.g., PM2.5 decreased by 59% between 2013-2017).
What can Delhi learn from the Beijing experience?
Integrated Public Transport System:
Establishing an efficient bus-metro system to reduce reliance on private vehicles is essential. Upgrading the bus fleet and enhancing last-mile connectivity can significantly improve public transport accessibility.
Energy Transition:
Similar to Beijing’s shift away from coal, Delhi should diversify its energy sources by promoting renewable energy options like solar power while reducing dependence on coal-fired plants.
Regional Coordination:
Pollution control efforts should extend beyond city limits to include neighboring regions, fostering collaboration similar to Beijing’s regional initiatives.
Public Advocacy for Clean Air:
Encouraging citizen engagement in demanding accountability from the government can build political will for implementing necessary changes.
Political Will and Consistency:
Addressing air pollution requires sustained political commitment and a long-term action plan rather than ad hoc measures that fail to tackle root causes.
Way forward:
Strengthen Policy Implementation and Regional Collaboration:
Formulate and enforce a comprehensive, long-term pollution control policy with coordinated efforts involving Delhi and its neighboring states to address regional pollution sources effectively.
Promote Sustainable Infrastructure and Public Engagement:
Invest in renewable energy, green public transport, and urban planning while fostering public participation and advocacy for clean air to ensure accountability and sustained progress.
Mains PYQ:
Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata are the three Mega cities of the country but the air pollution is much more serious probelm in Delhi as compared to the other two. Why is this so?

**********What is Disease X and why should the world prepare for it?
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related to the Health Sector;
Why in the News?
The outbreak reported in the first week of December 2024 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has already claimed more than 400 lives and is yet to be classified, has sparked concerns that it might be an example of Disease X.
What is Disease X?
Definition:
Disease X is a hypothetical term coined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018 to represent an unknown pathogen that could potentially cause a global epidemic or pandemic.
Conceptual Origin:
The term was created in the aftermath of the Ebola epidemic (2014-2016) to emphasise the need for preparedness against unpredictable infectious diseases.
Nature of Disease X:
It serves as a placeholder for both “known unknowns” (threats we are aware of but do not fully understand) and “unknown unknowns” (threats we are not yet aware of). This acknowledges the likelihood of future pandemics without specifying their characteristics.
Potential Pathogens:
Disease X could originate from a variety of sources, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi, helminths, or prions. Historical data indicates that about 70% of emerging infectious diseases have zoonotic origins, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans.
Emerging Disease Patterns:
The emergence of new diseases is often linked to ecological disruptions caused by human activities such as deforestation and urbanisation, which increase contact between humans and wildlife.
Why is it Important to Prepare for Disease X?
Global Health Security:
Preparing for Disease X is essential for protecting public health globally. The emergence of new pathogens can lead to widespread illness and mortality, as demonstrated by COVID-19.
Unpredictable Nature of Outbreaks:
The unpredictable emergence of infectious diseases necessitates robust surveillance and rapid response systems. Being prepared helps mitigate the impact of unforeseen threats.
Increasing Frequency of Outbreaks:
The frequency of novel outbreaks has significantly increased since the mid-20th century due to environmental changes, urbanization, and human encroachment on wildlife habitats.
Economic Impact:
Pandemics can have devastating economic consequences, disrupting trade, travel, and healthcare systems. Preparedness can help minimize these impacts.
What should be done to prevent this? ( Way forward)
Advances in Science and Technology:
Investments in research, genomic sequencing, artificial intelligence, and public health infrastructure enhance our ability to detect and respond to emerging diseases quickly.
International Cooperation:
Global collaboration is crucial for effective outbreak response. Initiatives like the WHO’s priority pathogen list and proposed Pandemic Treaty aim to foster a unified approach to health emergencies.
Equitable Access to Resources:
Ensuring equitable access to diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines across all countries is vital for effective pandemic response, particularly in low- and middle-income nations.
Mains PYQ:
COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented devastation worldwide. However, technological advancements are being availed readily to win over the crisis. Give an account of how technology was sought to aid the management of the pandemic.

**********The missing spotlight on urban local government polls
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Challenges related to ULBs;
Why in the News?
The ongoing debate on simultaneous elections, commonly referred to as One Nation One Election (ONOE), presents a valuable opportunity to highlight a fundamental aspect of local democracy: the need for elections to Urban Local Governments (ULGs).
What is the Significance of Urban Local Government elections?
Decentralized Governance
: ULGs are crucial for decentralized self-governance, which is fundamental to democratic functioning at the grassroots level.
Service Delivery
: ULGs are responsible for delivering essential civic services such as water, sanitation, public health, and urban planning, which directly affect citizens’ quality of life.
Local Democracy
: Regular elections to ULGs ensure democratic legitimacy, enabling citizens to participate in the governance process at the local level and hold local representatives accountable.
Economic and Social Impact
: ULGs play a vital role in urban development, economic growth, and social well-being. As cities are responsible for a significant portion of the country’s GDP, well-governed local bodies contribute to national prosperity.
Why is Voter Turnout in Urban Local Elections Typically Lower?
Lack of Awareness
: Voter awareness regarding local elections is often lower than that for state or national elections, leading to reduced participation.
Perceived Impact
: Many voters feel that the impact of urban local elections is less significant compared to state or national elections, resulting in voter apathy.
Political Disengagement
: In many cases, urban residents may feel disconnected from local governance, especially when local issues are not perceived as urgent or when political campaigns do not adequately address them.
Timing and Scheduling Issues
: Elections to ULGs may be held at different times or not synchronized with other elections, causing confusion and disengagement.
Voter Fatigue
: Frequent elections at different levels may contribute to voter fatigue, lowering participation rates in local elections.
What reforms are necessary to enhance the effectiveness of urban local governments?
Empower State Election Commissions (SECs):
Strengthening SECs by granting them autonomy and resources for conducting timely and fair elections is essential. Currently, many SECs lack the authority to carry out ward delimitation effectively, which delays elections.
Regular Elections:
Ensuring that ULGs hold regular elections every five years is crucial. The recent acceptance of recommendations by the High-Level Committee (HLC) for synchronizing local body elections with state and national polls is a positive step in this direction.
Decentralization of Powers:
The 74th Constitutional Amendment aimed at decentralizing powers to ULGs; however, actual implementation has been inconsistent.
Public Participation:
Encouraging greater public involvement in decision-making processes will enhance transparency and accountability within ULGs. This can be achieved through community engagement initiatives and participatory budgeting processes.
Way forward:
Strengthen Institutional Capacity and Autonomy
: Empower State Election Commissions (SECs) with the necessary authority and resources to ensure timely and independent elections.
Promote Public Engagement and Accountability
: Encourage active public participation through initiatives like community engagement, participatory budgeting, and transparency in governance. This will improve the responsiveness of ULGs to citizen needs and foster stronger local democracy.
Mains PYQ:
The strength and sustenance of local institutions in India has shifted from their formative phase of ‘Functions, Functionaries and Funds’to the contemporary stage of ‘Functionality’. Highlightthe critical challenges faced by local institutions in terms of their functionality in recent times.
