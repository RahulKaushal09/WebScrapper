**********Lake Erie
Research has shown that toxins from these bacteria called microcystin can make animals and people sick when they come into contact with infected water of Lake Erie.
About Lake Erie:
It is the
fourth largest
of the five Great Lakes of
North America.
It forms the
boundary between Canada
(Ontario) to the north and the
United States
to the west, south, and east.
The lake’s principal tributary rivers are the Detroit (carrying the discharge of Lake Huron), Huron, and Raisin rivers of Michigan etc.
The lake discharges at its eastern end through the Niagara River.
It is an important link in the
Lawrence Seaway.
What is Microcystin?
single-celled freshwater cyanobacterium
that forms colonies surrounded by mucilage.
The genus Microcystis contains several species which often form massive blooms and which produce toxins.
Microcystin is a potent liver toxin and
possible human carcinogen.
It inhibits the activities of protein phosphatase-1 and protein phosphatase-2A, which leads to disruption of the cytoskeleton network and subsequent cell death.

**********What is E. coli?
According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a person died and 49 others fell ill following an E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder Hamburgers.
About E. coli:
Escherichia coli
, commonly known as E. coli, is a type of bacteria that can be found in the
intestines of humans and animals
coli is a rod-shaped bacterium of the
Enterobacteriaceae family.
While most strains of E. coli are harmless and even beneficial, some strains can cause illness and infections.
Some kinds of E. coli can cause diarrhea, while others cause
urinary tract infections
, respiratory illness and pneumonia, and other illnesses.
Transmission:
It can be transmitted to humans through
contaminated food, water, or contact with fecal matter
from infected individuals or animals.
How does E. coli make you sick?
The most familiar strains of E. coli that make you sick do so by producing a
toxin called Shiga.
This toxin damages the lining of your small intestine and causes diarrhea.
These strains of E. coli are also called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC).
Symptoms:
The most common symptoms of E.coli infection include
fever
of more than 102 degree F,
persistent diarrhoea, bloody diarrhoea
, and vomiting.
The main problem, however, is
dehydration
due to the inability of the patient to retain water and fluids.
In very few cases, people may get
acute kidney injury.
Treatment:
Most E. coli infections are self-limiting and resolve on their own without treatment. However, it's essential to stay hydrated during the course of the illness.

**********India – China Bilateral Relationship
What’s in Today’s Article?
India – China Bilateral Relationship (Historical Background, Economic Ties, Strategic Cooperation, Challenges, etc.)
News Summary
Historical Background:
The relationship between
India and China
dates back over two millennia, with deep-rooted cultural and economic ties through the
Silk Road
However, their modern diplomatic relationship began post-independence, with India becoming one of the first non-communist countries to recognize the
People’s Republic of China (PRC)
in 1950.
The relationship faced a significant setback due to the
Sino-Indian War of 1962
, which created a long-lasting border dispute, particularly in the
Ladakh
Arunachal Pradesh
Despite several rounds of negotiations, the border issue remains unresolved, casting a shadow over their bilateral relationship.
Economic & Commercial Ties:
Economic cooperation between India and China has grown rapidly, despite political differences. As of 2023:
China is India’s largest trading partner
, with bilateral trade exceeding
$135.98 billion
in 2022-23.
India’s imports from China, primarily in electronics, machinery, and chemicals, contribute to a
significant trade deficit
, which stood at
$83.2 billion
Conversely, India's exports to China, which include iron ore, cotton, and other raw materials, are considerably lower, raising concerns about economic dependency on Chinese imports.
However, recent years have seen India adopting measures to reduce this trade deficit and enhance domestic production capabilities through initiatives like
Atmanirbhar Bharat
Strategic Cooperation:
Despite tensions, India and China have cooperated on various global platforms:
Both countries are part of multilateral organizations such as
BRICS
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)
, and the
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
, reflecting their shared interests in regional and global governance.
India and China are key stakeholders in the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)
, though India has refrained from joining the agreement citing concerns over Chinese dominance in trade.
There has also been collaboration on
climate change
, where both countries push for greater action by developed nations while advocating for the rights of developing countries.
Challenges in Relationship:
Despite strong economic and multilateral engagements, the
India-China relationship faces several challenges
Border Disputes
: The primary challenge remains the
Line of Actual Control (LAC)
. Tensions escalated in
2020
with the
Galwan Valley clash
, leading to casualties on both sides.
Even though there have been multiple rounds of military and diplomatic talks, the situation remains fragile, and
troop standoffs
continue in parts of the LAC.
China-Pakistan Nexus
: China’s close strategic and economic ties with
, particularly through the
China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
, which passes through the
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK)
region, is a significant point of contention for India.
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
: India has raised concerns over China's
project, which it perceives as undermining its sovereignty, especially given the CPEC's route through disputed territories.
Trade Imbalance
: The growing trade deficit continues to be a major challenge for India, along with concerns over China’s trade practices and its impact on domestic industries.
News Summary:
On
October 23, 2024
Prime Minister Narendra Modi
Chinese President Xi Jinping
held their first formal talks in five years on the side-lines of the
BRICS summit
Kazan, Russia
This meeting signals an important step toward recovery in India-China relations, which were severely damaged by the
2020 military clash
in Ladakh.
Both leaders emphasized the need for
maturity, mutual respect
, and efforts to ensure
peace and stability
in their ties.
Prime Minister Modi highlighted the importance of not allowing
border-related differences
to disturb peace and tranquility at the borders, while both sides welcomed the recent border agreements that resulted from sustained dialogues over the past few weeks.
Modi and Xi stressed that a stable bilateral relationship between India and China would have a positive impact on
regional and global peace
Diplomatic efforts have gained momentum in recent months, with talks focused on easing the border tensions.
The discussions may also pave the way for potential
Chinese investments
in India, as India had made improving business ties contingent on resolving the border stand-off​.

**********SC Expands States' Power to Tax Industrial Alcohol
Why in News?
A nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India (SC), in an 8:1 decision, ruled that states have the authority to impose taxes not only on alcoholic beverages but also on 'industrial' alcohol. This decision expands states' revenue-generating capabilities, with significant implications for both taxation and federalism.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background of the Dispute of Taxing Industrial Alcohol
The SC’s Verdict on Taxing Industrial Alcohol
Implications of SC’s Verdict on Taxing Industrial Alcohol
Background of the Dispute of Taxing Industrial Alcohol:
Background:
Why is the taxation of industrial alcohol controversial?
Overlapping constitutional entries:
The dispute involved
two entries in the Seventh Schedule
of the Constitution.
Entry 8 of List II
(State List)
gives states authority over intoxicating liquors, while
Entry 52 of List I (Union List)
grant the Centre the power to regulate industries.
Additionally,
Entry 33 of List III (Concurrent List)
grants the Centre authority over any industry that Parliament has legally determined to be in the public interest.
Centre claims its jurisdiction:
According to the central government, industrial alcohol falls under its jurisdiction due to its inclusion in
the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951.
The Act was passed by Parliament under the above two heads of the Union and Concurrent Lists.
The SC’s Verdict on Taxing Industrial Alcohol:
The main question before the court:
The court's primary concern was whether the term "intoxicating liquor" could also encompass "industrial alcohol."
States argued that they should regulate industrial alcohol, given its potential misuse in creating illegal consumable alcohol.
Majority opinion:
The majority, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud, along with eight other justices,
ruled in favour of the states
They reasoned that the term “intoxicating liquor”
under Entry 8 of List II (State List)
should be interpreted broadly, covering everything from the production of raw materials to consumption.
The court affirmed that
states have the power to tax both alcoholic beverages and industrial alcohol
, which can produce intoxication or pose health risks.
The court disagreed with the Centre’s argument that industrial alcohol falls under its jurisdiction due to its inclusion in the 1951 Act.
Dissenting opinion:
Justice B V Nagarathna dissented, arguing that the Centre should retain control over industrial alcohol.
She maintained that
industrial alcohol, by its nature, should not fall under the definition of intoxicating liquor
, despite its potential misuse.
In her view, the Centre's control over industries, as outlined in the 1951 Act, should prevent states from regulating industrial alcohol.
Implications of SC’s Verdict on Taxing Industrial Alcohol:
Overturned a previous judgement:
The majority ruling overturned the SC's
1990
judgement in
Synthetics & Chemicals Ltd vs State of Uttar Pradesh
, which had held that states could not tax industrial alcohol.
The latest decision affirms that states have the legislative competence to regulate and tax industrial alcohol, even though it is non-potable.
Impact on States' revenue:
The court’s decision significantly impacts state revenues, with
alcohol taxation already being a major source of income
For example
, Karnataka raised its Additional Excise Duty (AED) on Indian-made liquor by 20% in 2023.
The ruling
reaffirms states' ability to control this critical revenue stream
Federal balance and Centre-State relations:
The ruling addressed the
delicate balance
between state and central powers.
The majority emphasised that, when constitutional entries overlap, the
interpretation that preserves federal balance should prevail.
In this case, giving states the power over industrial alcohol aligns with maintaining that balance,
avoiding redundancy in constitutional provisions
This decision follows a similar 8:1 majority ruling (in July 2024), which upheld
states' authority to levy royalties on mineral extraction
and tax the lands where mines are located.

**********Stubble-burning violates right to live in a pollution-free environment
Why in news?
Recently, the Supreme Court raised concerns over the ongoing issue of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. The court condemned the selective enforcement of penalties, describing it as a violation of citizens' fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to live in a pollution-free environment.
What’s in today’s article?
Right to environment in India constitution
Stubble burning
Key highlights of the observation made by SC
Right to life under Article 21
The Supreme Court in
Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar, 1991
held that Article 21 includes the right to a wholesome environment.
This position was again reaffirmed in Virender Gaur v. State of Haryana,1994.
Directive Principle of State Policy
Article 48A
puts a duty on the State to protect and improve the environment and further to safeguard the forests and wildlife.
Sher Singh vs State of H.P. 2014
, the National Green Tribunal held that the State is under a constitutional obligation to protect and improve the environment.
M
C. Mehta vs Union of India, 2002
, the court held that Article 39(e), 47 and 48A collectively cast a duty on State to secure public health and environment protection.
Fundamental Duties
Article 51A(g) puts a fundamental duty on the citizens to protect and preserve the environment.
Stubble Burning
Why Farmers opt for Stubble Burning?
Rice and wheat straws left in the field, after combine harvesting, are generally burnt by the farmers to
facilitate seed bed preparation and seeding
Farmers find this method as quick and cheap compared to other practices for crop residue management.
Since input costs of farming is going up day by day, farmers are not willing to further invest in equipments useful for crop residue management.
Happy Seeder (a tractor-operated machine for in-situ management of paddy stubble) continues to be an expensive method for majority of farmers
Areas where this practice is rampant
Burning of agricultural residue is done on a large-scale basis in states such as
Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and National Capital Region of Delhi
This is prevalent in other states too. This includes: Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal etc.
Impact
Environmental Pollution
Agriculture fires are a major contributor to air pollution in north India in October-November.
Pollutants from these fires spread across the region, triggering smog and extreme air quality situations.
An increase in the concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM 10 in the atmosphere is observed in these months.
Harmful to the health of soil
Burning of crop residues removes huge amount of nutrient from the soil.
Practices like residue burning has further reduced the organic carbon content in soil.
Steps Taken by the government to tackle the issue of farm fires
Taken by Centre
A Central Sector Scheme on ‘
Promotion of Agricultural Mechanisation for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delh
i’ was approved.
Farmers are being provided 50 percent of the cost of machinery/equipment as financial assistance for the purchase of such machinery.
The central government has released Rs 3,062 crore to the governments of Punjab, Delhi and states in NCR during the five-year period from 2018 to 2023 towards effective management of stubble.
Profit from the left-over biomass is shared with farmers.
Pusa Decomposer by Indian Agricultural research Institute (IARI)
The Pusa decomposer is a bio-enzyme developed by IARI to decompose crop residue.
It decomposes stubble within 20-25 days after spraying and turn it into manure, improving the soil quality.
Taken by State Governments and Other agencies
States governments and other agencies are sensitising farmers on healthier practices.
The Punjab government had proposed to provide cash incentives to farmers for not burning stubble.
It also decided to provide non-fiscal incentives to these industries in terms of availability of Panchayat land for storage of paddy straw with lease agreement upto 33 years.
Fundamental Right to a Pollution-Free Environment
The Supreme Court emphasized that every citizen has a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to live in a pollution-free environment.
It stressed that violations of this right go beyond mere implementation of laws, highlighting the blatant infringement of fundamental rights.
Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act Rendered "Toothless"
The court criticized the ineffectiveness of the amended Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act-1986,
which replaced criminal penalties with financial penalties for environmental violations
This provision has become "toothless" due to the Centre's failure to establish necessary support systems, such as framing rules and appointing adjudicating officers, even after six months of the amendment's enactment.
Inadequate Enforcement Mechanism
The absence of appointed adjudicating officers prevents law enforcement from imposing penalties under the amended Section 15, leaving environmental violations unpunished.

**********Spraying diamond dust to cool Earth
Why in news?
The recent study in Geophysical Research Letters explores
geo-engineering
, specifically solar radiation management, to mitigate global warming.
It suggests spraying millions of tonnes of diamond dust into Earth's upper atmosphere to reflect solar radiation away from the planet, potentially cooling it.
What’s in today’s article?
Geo-engineering
Use of diamonds to cool down the Earth
What is geo-engineering?
It involves large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system to combat the negative effects of global warming.
It includes two main approaches: Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR).
Need for geo-engineering
Efforts to curb global warming have fallen short, as global temperatures continue to rise and greenhouse gas emissions have not been significantly reduced.
Global temperatures are currently about 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels, with 2023 seeing a 1.45°C increase.
The 1.5°C limit, outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, is unlikely to be met, though some theoretical scenarios suggest it remains possible.
To meet the 1.5°C target,
global emissions must be reduced by at least 43% from 2019 levels by 2030
However, current and planned actions are expected to achieve only a 2% reduction by that deadline.
Main approaches of geo-engineering
SRM strategies focus on reflecting incoming solar rays to reduce Earth's temperature.
This involves deploying reflective materials in space to block solar radiation, preventing it from reaching the planet's surface.
Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) Technologies
CDR aims to remove excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
This includes technologies like:
Carbon Capture and Sequestration
(CCS), which capture CO₂ at the source and store it underground, and
Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage
(CCUS), where captured carbon is partially reused in industrial processes while the rest is stored.
Direct Air Capture (DAC)
DAC methods involve extracting carbon dioxide directly from the ambient air using large-scale “artificial trees.”
The captured CO₂ is either stored or used, potentially addressing accumulated carbon emissions over the years.
Although promising, DAC faces significant technological and economic challenges.
Current State of Geoengineering Efforts
Among the geoengineering options, CCS is the only method currently in practical use, capturing emissions from industrial sources for underground storage.
Experimental projects are exploring DAC and other advanced technologies, but none are widely implemented yet due to their complexities and high costs.
Challenges
Challenges of Implementing Solar Radiation Management (SRM)
SRM, while theoretically possible, faces significant technological and financial obstacles.
Large-scale manipulation of natural processes carries risks, including unpredictable impacts on global and regional weather patterns.
Ethical concerns arise, as altering sunlight could affect agriculture, ecosystems, and biodiversity, potentially harming some species
Limitations of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS)
Although CCS is technically viable in some situations, various studies suggest that heavy dependence on CCS to meet climate goals is not practical.
It highlights that focusing on
CCS instead of renewable energy could add at least $30 trillion to global costs by 2050
Additionally, there may not be enough suitable underground sites to safely store large quantities of carbon dioxide.
Conclusion: The Inevitable Role of CCS and CDR Technologies
Despite their limitations, CCS and CDR remain crucial components in any strategy to combat climate change.
Achieving the 1.5°C or 2°C targets is considered impossible without incorporating these technologies, given the current levels of global warming.
About the news
A research study has argued that diamonds can really be the answer to the global climate crisis.
They were testing out various aerosols to cool Earth, when they found that more than anybody, diamonds can prove to be more effective.
The proposal
As per their analysis, shooting five million tonnes of diamond dust into the stratosphere each year, over the course of 45 years, could cool our planet by an impressive 1.6°C.
Why diamond
Researchers had shortlisted calcite, diamond, aluminum, silicon carbide, anatase, and rutile, and created a 3D model.
They found out that diamond particles were highly effective in reflecting sunlight and heat, while simultaneously staying in the atmosphere for long enough.
Further since diamonds are chemically inert, they won't react with other elements in the atmosphere.
Not the first time such a solution has been proposed
Several other compounds, such as sulphur, calcium, aluminium, and silicon, have been suggested previously for doing the same job.
Sulfur dioxide has been a leading candidate for solar radiation management due to its natural cooling effects observed during volcanic eruptions, where it reflects sunlight away from Earth.
However, artificial injection poses significant risks, including the potential for acid rain, damage to the ozone layer, and disruption of weather patterns, making it a controversial geo-engineering option.
The central idea here is to scatter material that can reflect solar radiation into Space and prevent it from reaching Earth, thereby cooling down the planet.
The installation of space-based mirrors has also been proposed.
Associated challenge
While the study looks promising on paper, the biggest obstacle in making it practical is the price of diamonds, one of the most expensive elements in the world.
The cost of producing and distributing the required quantity of synthetic diamonds would be staggering, with estimates reaching as high as $200 trillion—which is double the global economy in 2023.

**********Madarsa Education Act: SC reserves order on appeals against Allahabad HC’s ‘Unconstitutional’ verdict
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Importance of Secularism in India; Education; Judiciary;
Why in the News?
The Supreme Court reserved its decision on appeals challenging the Allahabad HC’s verdict, which declared the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004 as ‘Unconstitutional’.
What is the UP Madarsa Education Act of 2004?
The UP Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004, was enacted to establish a
regulatory framework for madrasas
in the state.
Aim
: To ensure the delivery of quality education in these institutions while aligning them with constitutional principles.
Key Provisions
: The Act set up the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education, responsible for prescribing
curricula, conducting examinations,
and
certifying students
in registered madrasas.
State Involvement
: It allowed the government to provide grants, regulate the functioning of madrasas, and inspect their adherence to standards, ensuring uniformity and compliance with educational norms.
On what grounds did the Allahabad HC declare the Madarsa Act as ‘Unconstitutional’?
Violation of Secularism
: The Allahabad High Court ruled that the Act violated the principle of secularism, which is a fundamental aspect of the Indian Constitution.
The court held that the
state’s direct involvement
administration
funding of religious institutions
like madrasas contradicted the secular character enshrined in the Constitution.
Equality Before Law
: The Act was also found to contravene
Article 14
, which ensures equality before the law.
The court noted that providing special educational arrangements for madrasas amounted to favoring a
particular religious community,
which was deemed discriminatory against others.
What are the key arguments on the Constitutionality of the Madarsa Education Act before the SC?
For the Act’s Constitutionality
Promoting Educational Rights
: Petitioners argued that the Act was intended to improve the quality of education in madrasas by incorporating modern subjects, thereby fulfilling the state’s obligation under
Article 21A (Right to Education)
Minority Rights Protection
: They contended that the Act safeguarded the rights of religious and linguistic minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice under
Article 30
Against the Act’s Constitutionality
State Involvement in Religious Education
: Critics argued that the state’s involvement in regulating and funding madrasas blurred the line between state and religion, thus it leads to violating the secular framework.
Discriminatory Approach
: It was contended that the Act granted privileges to one community’s educational institutions, potentially discriminating against others.
Alternative Educational Models
: The state’s direct regulation of madrasas was seen as unnecessary when
secular education
could be provided through other existing educational frameworks.
What are the wider Implications of the SC’s decision on the Madarsa Education Act?
Impact on Minority Educational Rights
: If the Supreme Court upholds the Act, it may strengthen the right of minorities to receive state support for their educational institutions.
Conversely, striking down the Act could set a precedent for limiting state involvement in religious institutions.
Revisiting the Secularism Principle
: The ruling could lead to a reassessment of how secularism is interpreted, particularly concerning state interactions with minority educational institutions.
Implications for Other Religious Schools
: The judgment could have broader ramifications for other religious institutions that receive government aid or regulation, potentially prompting similar legal challenges.
Integration of Madrasas into Mainstream Education
: If the Act is declared unconstitutional, the state may need to find alternative ways to integrate madrasa students into the formal educational system without compromising on their cultural and religious needs.
Way forward:
Reform the Act to Align with Secular Principles
: Amend the Act to focus on educational standards without direct state involvement in religious affairs, ensuring compliance with constitutional values of secularism and equality.
Promote Inclusive Educational Models
: Integrate madrasa education into the mainstream system by introducing modern subjects while respecting cultural and religious contexts, allowing students to benefit from both secular and religious education.

**********SC upholds State legislatures’ right to regulate Industrial Alcohol as an ‘Intoxicant’
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Federal Issues; Center vs state; Internal Security;
Why in the News?
A nine-judge Constitution Bench, with an
8:1 majority
, affirmed the authority of State legislatures to regulate industrial alcohol.
What is the definition of “intoxicating liquor” with industrial alcohol?
The SC’s ruling established that the term “intoxicating liquor” in
Entry 8 of the State List
should be interpreted broadly to include not only potable alcohol but also
, such as rectified spirit,
extra neutral alcohol (ENA)
, and denatured spirit.
This definition extends beyond the popular meaning of
as alcoholic beverages meant for consumption.
Public Health Consideration:
The ruling emphasized that alcohol, in any form, is a
noxious substance prone to misuse
. Hence, industrial alcohol, which can potentially be diverted for the production of illicit or harmful alcoholic beverages, falls under the regulatory domain of the States to protect
public health and safety
Legal Precedent:
The Court cited previous decisions where the interpretation of “intoxicating liquor” was not confined to just alcoholic beverages but also included forms of alcohol that could be detrimental to health if used improperly.
How does this ruling impact the balance of power between state and central governments?
Strengthening State Autonomy:
The ruling affirms that
States have the legislative competence
to regulate industrial alcohol according to
By upholding the States’ right to regulate industrial alcohol, the judgment reinforces
federalism
and the autonomy of State legislatures in matters that fall within the ambit of their
constitutional authority
This challenges the Centre’s claim to exclusive control over industrial alcohol under
Entry 52 of the Union List
, which pertains to industries regulated by the Union for public interest.
Restriction on Centre’s Authority:
The judgment limits the
Union government’s power
and clarifies that
Parliament’s control over industries under Entry 52 is limited
and does not extend to regulating industrial alcohol in its entirety.
How does it impact the state revenues and public health?
State Revenues:
The ruling potentially enhances
States’ power to levy taxes and fees
related to the production, manufacture, and sale of industrial alcohol. This could result in
increased revenue generation
from excise duties on alcohol-based products and licensing fees.
Public Health Regulation:
Having
greater regulatory control
over the production and distribution of industrial alcohol will help the states
curb the misuse
of substances like rectified spirit and ENA in the production of illicit liquor. This can improve
public health outcomes
by reducing instances of
alcohol poisoning and illicit liquor-related deaths
Policy Formulation:
The judgment may prompt States to
strengthen policies and enforcement mechanisms
regarding alcohol regulation, ensuring that industrial alcohol is not diverted for unauthorized uses.
Way forward:
Strengthen Regulatory Framework:
States should enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to prevent the diversion of industrial alcohol for illicit uses, ensuring strict compliance with safety standards and public health protections.
Collaborative Policy Development:
The Centre and States should work together to harmonize regulations, balancing State autonomy with national interests, while focusing on safeguarding public health and optimizing revenue generation from alcohol-related activities.
Previous Year Question:
Q)
It is a State where prohibition is in force. You are recently appointed as the Superintendent of Police of a district notorious for illicit distillation of liquor. The illicit liquor leads to many deaths, reported and unreported, and causes a major problem for the district authorities. The approach till now had been to view it as a law and order problem and tackle it accordingly. Raids, arrests, police cases, and criminal trials – all these had only limited impact. The problem remains as serious as ever. Your inspections show that the parts of the district where the distillation flourishes are economically, industrially, and educationally backward. Agriculture is badly affected by poor irrigation facilities. Frequent clashes among communities gave a boost to illicit distillation. No major initiatives had taken place in the past either from the government’s side or from social organizations to improve the lot of the people. Which new approach will you adopt to bring the problem under control?

.”
Lahore’s AQI value exceeds the
World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline
by over
55.6 times
Primary Causes of Lahore’s Severe Air Pollution:
Stubble Burning:
Farmers in Punjab (India and Pakistan) burn crop residue, especially after rice harvesting, during winter to prepare fields for wheat cultivation.
Vehicular Emissions:
The rise in the number of vehicles in Lahore, along with the use of low-quality fuel, results in high levels of PM2.5 emissions, a major contributor to air pollution.
Industrial Pollution:
Factories and brick kilns in and around Lahore emit harmful pollutants, including particulate matter, adding to the city’s poor air quality.
Geography and Weather Conditions:
Lahore’s location in a
low-lying region
and its geography, surrounded by hills, leads to temperature inversion during the winter, trapping pollutants near the surface and preventing their natural dispersal.
Coal-Fired Power Plants:
Large power plants, such as the 1320MW Sahiwal coal-fired power plant in Punjab, part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), emit sulphur and other pollutants, significantly contributing to smog and air pollution.
