**********What is Trachoma?
Recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared that the Government of India has eliminated Trachoma as a public health problem becoming the third country in the South-East Asia Region to achieve this milestone.
About
Trachoma:
It is a
bacterial infection
that affects the eyes.
It is caused by the bacterium
Chlamydia Trachomatis.
How it spreads?
is contagious
; spreading through contact with the eyes, eyelids, nose or throat secretions of infected people, if left untreated it
causes irreversible blindness.
It is found in communities that are living in
poor
environmental conditions.
WHO has termed Trachoma as a
neglected tropical disease
and its estimation suggests that 150 million people worldwide are affected by Trachoma and 6 million of them are blind or at risk of visually disabling complications.
Initiatives of Government of India
The Government of India launched the
National Trachoma Control Program in 1963
and later on Trachoma control efforts were integrated into India’s
National Program for Control of Blindness (NPCB).
As a result, in 2017, India was declared free from infective Trachoma. However, surveillance continued for trachoma cases in all the districts of India from 2019 onwards till 2024.
National Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT only) Survey
was also carried out in 200 endemic districts of the country under the National Programme for Control of Blindness & Visual Impairment (NPCBVI) from 2021-24, which was a mandate set by WHO to declare that India has eliminated Trachoma as a public health problem.
To eliminate trachoma as a public health problem,
WHO recommends the SAFE strategy.
The SAFE strategy includes:
Surgery to treat the blinding stage (trachomatous trichiasis); Antibiotics to clear the infection, particularly the antibiotic azithromycin; Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement, particularly improving access to water and sanitation.

**********Gig Economy in India
Why in the News?
The Fairwork India Ratings 2024 report examines the changing nature of platform work as platforms increasingly take control of when and for how long workers can provide services, or gigs.
The report titled ‘
Fairwork India Ratings 2024: Labour Standards in the Platform Economy
’ is the sixth consecutive annual study of this nature conducted by the Fairwork India Team.
It is a joint effort by the Centre for IT and Public Policy (CITAPP), International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIIT-B), in association with Oxford University.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Gig Economy (Meaning, Gig Workers, Size of Economy, Average Income, Challenges, etc.)
News Summary (Key Findings of the Report)
What is Gig Economy?
A gig economy is a free market system in which organisations hire or contract workers for a short span of time.
Simply put, the positions are temporary to meet the company’s requirements by having short-term engagements.
Startups like Ola, Uber, Zomato, and Swiggy have established themselves as the main source of the gig economy in India.
Who is a Gig Worker?
According to the Code on Social Security, 2020 (India), “
A gig worker is a person who performs work or participates in work arrangements and earns from such activities, outside of the traditional employer-employee relationship.”
They are independent contractors, online platform workers, contract firm workers, on-call workers and temporary workers.
What is the Size of Gig Economy in India?
NITI Aayog study on “India’s Booming Gig and Platform Economy”
has estimated that at present, about 47 per cent of the gig work is in medium-skilled jobs, about 22 per cent in high skilled, and about 31 per cent in low-skilled jobs.
These figures clearly indicate the importance of the gig working community in the Indian economy.
Ensuring the comfort and security of this community is investing in a more progressive and prosperous future.
Various studies have indicated that participation in the gig economy is higher in developing countries(5-12 percent) versus developed economies(1-4 percent).
Most of these jobs are in lower-income job-types such as deliveries, ridesharing, microtasks, care and wellness.
These studies further estimate that in 2020-21,
77 lakh workers were engaged in the gig economy
The gig workforce is expected to
expand to 2.35 crore workers by 2029-30
What is the Average Age/Income of Gig Workers in India?
median age of Indian gig workers is 27 and their average monthly income is Rs 18,000
Of these, about 71 per cent are the sole breadwinners of their families. Additionally, gig workers operate with an average household size of 4.4.
Challenges Faced by Gig Workers:
While platform companies have created avenues of employment, it has often been marred by
low wages
unequal gender participation
lack of possibility for upward mobility
within an organisation.
This has triggered protests from workers at companies like Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, Uber, and Urban Company, among others.
Gig workers are typically
hired by companies on a contractual basis
and are not considered their employees.
As a result, they do not receive some of the benefits that an on-roll employee of the company may have.
This means they often do not receive benefits like paid sick and casual leaves, travel and housing allowances, and provident fund savings, among other things.
What Needs to be done in Order to Improve the Living Standards of these Gig Workers?
Fiscal Incentives
NITI Aayog in its report ”India’s Booming Gig and Platform Economy” has said that fiscal incentives such as tax-breaks or startup grants may be provided for businesses that provide livelihood opportunities where women constitute a substantial portion of their workers.
Retirement Benefits
The report also recommended firms adopt policies that offer old age or retirement plans and benefits, and other insurance cover for contingencies such as the Covid-19 Pandemic.
Such plans and policies may be envisaged under the
Businesses should consider
providing income support to workers as it would be a “critical step in providing assured minimum earnings and social security from income loss in the wake of uncertainty or irregularity in work
It also suggesting offering paid sick leave to workers apart from insurance cover.
Case Study: The Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act 2023
The Rajasthan State Assembly passed the Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act 2023.
Under the Act, a board will be established to ensure gig workers’ registration and welfare, addressing their vulnerabilities and providing a platform for collective bargaining and negotiations.
The board can serve as an independent
grievance redress mechanism
The Act also has a provision of establishing a
social security fund
funded through a fee on every transaction.
Fairwork India Ratings 2024 report:
report evaluates the working conditions of platform workers across various digital platforms in India.
It highlights that many platforms do not ensure that their workers earn a
local living wage
and are generally unwilling to acknowledge the
collectivization
of workers.
The report also discusses potential legislative changes for gig workers in states like
Karnataka
Jharkhand
Key Findings of the Report:
Overall Ratings
No platform achieved more than
6 out of 10 points
in the assessment.
The platforms were evaluated on
five key principles
: Fair Pay, Fair Conditions, Fair Contracts, Fair Management, and Fair Representation.
Assessment of Fair Pay
Only
Bigbasket
earned the first point under Fair Pay by ensuring a minimum wage that covers at least the
local minimum wage
after deducting work-related expenses.
No platform received the second point, which requires proof that workers earn a
after work-related costs.
Evaluation of Fair Conditions
Platforms such as
Amazon Flex, BigBasket, BluSmart, Swiggy, Urban Company, Zepto,
earned points for providing
safety equipment
safety training
BigBasket, Swiggy, Urban Company, Zepto,
were further recognized for offering
accident insurance
compensation for income loss
due to medical reasons.
BigBasket, BluSmart, Swiggy, Urban Company, Zepto, and Zomato were awarded points for making contracts accessible and transparent.
They also had protocols to protect
worker data
Platforms like Amazon Flex, BigBasket, BluSmart, Flipkart, Swiggy, Urban Company, and Zomato provided mechanisms for appeals against disciplinary actions.
BluSmart, Swiggy, Urban Company, and Zomato conducted regular external audits to prevent biases in work allocation.
Despite a rise in
platform worker collectivization
over the last six years, no platform showed evidence of recognizing
collective worker bodies
or unions.
Implications & Future Prospects:
report underscores the growing attention towards
gig worker welfare
in political and legislative discussions.
However, the report raises concerns about the slow pace of actual implementation.
It calls for a balanced approach where
government bodies
worker collectives
work together to ensure better standards of living and working conditions for gig workers in India.
Overall, the report serves as a crucial reminder of the challenges faced by gig workers and the gaps that remain in ensuring fair work conditions across digital labor platforms in India.

**********Nobel Prize in Physics Honors Pioneering Advances in AI and Machine Learning
Why in news?
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to
John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton
for their foundational contributions to AI, particularly in machine learning and artificial neural networks.
Their ground-breaking research in the 1980s laid the foundation for the AI revolution unfolding today.
What’s in today’s article?
Machine learning
Deep Learning
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Works of Noble Prize winners
Machine learning (ML)
About
ML is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from and make decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed for each task.
In machine learning, algorithms identify patterns in large datasets and use these patterns to make predictions or perform specific tasks.
The key idea is that systems improve their performance over time through experience, by training on data.
Applications of Machine Learning:
Image and speech recognition
Recommendation systems (like those used by streaming services)
Fraud detection
Healthcare diagnostics
Autonomous vehicles
Deep Learning (DL)
Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that focuses on using artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep").
It mimics the structure and function of the human brain to recognize complex patterns in large datasets, such as images, text, or sound.
Deep learning has been pivotal in advancing AI technologies, particularly in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and self-driving cars.
Key Applications of Deep Learning:
(e.g., face detection, virtual assistants)
(e.g., self-driving cars)
Natural language processing
(e.g., language translation)
Medical diagnostics
(e.g., cancer detection in medical imaging)
ML Vs. DL
While
involves training algorithms with structured data and often requires human input for feature extraction,
deep learning
automates feature discovery using multi-layered neural networks, making it more powerful for complex tasks, especially when large datasets are available.
ANN is a mathematical model that uses a network of interconnected nodes to mimic the human brain's neurons and process data.
ANNs are a type of machine learning (ML) and deep learning that can learn from mistakes and improve over time.
They are used in artificial intelligence (AI) to solve complex problems, such as recognizing faces or summarizing documents.
Key features of ANNs
Structure
ANNs are made up of layers of nodes, each containing an activation function. The nodes are interconnected, with each node in a layer connected to many nodes in the previous and next layers.
ANNs are adaptive and learn from their mistakes using a backpropagation algorithm.
They modify themselves as they learn, with inputs that contribute to the right answers weighted higher.
Output
The output of the ANN is produced by the final layer of nodes. The output is usually a numerical prediction about the information the ANN received.
Applications of Artificial Neural Networks:
Image and video recognition (e.g., facial recognition systems)
Speech recognition (e.g., virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa)
Natural language processing (e.g., language translation)
Medical diagnostics (e.g., detecting diseases from medical images)
Autonomous vehicles (e.g., self-driving car navigation)
In essence, artificial neural networks mimic the brain’s ability to learn from experience, adapt, and recognize complex patterns, making them foundational to modern AI and machine learning systems.
Hopfield's contribution - Mimicking the Brain with Neural Networks
Hopfield's major breakthrough was creating artificial neural networks that mimic human brain functions like remembering and learning.
Hopfield's network processes information using the entire structure rather than individual bits, unlike traditional computing.
It captures patterns holistically, such as an image or song, and recalls or regenerates them even from incomplete inputs.
This breakthrough advanced pattern recognition in computers, paving the way for technologies like facial recognition and image enhancement.
His research was inspired by earlier discoveries in neuroscience, notably Donald Hebb's work on learning and synapses in 1949.
Hinton’s Contribution - Deep Learning and Advanced Neural Networks
Hinton advanced Hopfield’s work by developing deep neural networks capable of complex tasks like voice and image recognition.
His method of backpropagation enabled these networks to learn and improve over time through training with large datasets.
Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors," is an algorithm for supervised learning of artificial neural networks using gradient descent.
His contributions led to major advancements in AI technologies, including modern applications such as speech recognition, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants.
Hinton's deep learning networks made a significant impact at the 2012 ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge, where his team's algorithm dramatically improved image recognition technology.
His work demonstrated the vast potential of AI in various fields, including astronomy, where machine learning helps researchers analyze vast amounts of data.
Conclusion
Both Hopfield and Hinton have made pioneering contributions to the development of AI, with Hopfield bridging neuroscience, physics, and biology, and Hinton revolutionizing computer science.
Their work has shaped modern AI technologies, making them deserving recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics.

**********PSLV- C37 upper stage re-enters Earth orbit
Why in news?
ISRO announced the successful re-entry of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle-C37 (PSLV-C37) upper stage into Earth's atmosphere on October 6. This achievement aligns with global efforts to reduce space debris, supporting ISRO's goal of achieving debris-free space missions by 2030.
What’s in today’s article?
Space Debris
About
Space debris refers to defunct, human-made objects in Earth's orbit, such as non-functional satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments from satellite collisions.
These debris pose a growing threat to operational spacecraft, satellites, and the International Space Station (ISS).
Challenges
Collisions:
Even tiny debris can cause severe damage to satellites and space stations due to their high velocities.
Chain Reaction (Kessler Syndrome)
: Increasing debris can lead to more collisions, creating even more debris and increasing the risk of cascading damage.
Cost of Mitigation
: Tracking and removing debris require advanced technology and substantial financial investment.
Increasing space debris
With the rise in the number of satellites in orbit around the earth, space debris has become a pressing issue.
According to ISRO’s Space Situational Assessment report 2022, the world placed 2,533 objects in space in 179 launches in 2022.
The number of space objects greater than 10 cm in size in LEO is expected to be about 60,000 by 2030.
Legal provisions
Currently, there are no international space laws pertaining to LEO debris.
However, most space-exploring nations abide by the
Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines 2002
specified by the IADC. This was endorsed by the U.N. in 2007.
The guidelines outline methods to limit accidental collisions in orbit, break-ups during operations, intentional destruction, and post-mission break-ups.
International Institutions
Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC)
: A global forum that coordinates efforts to mitigate space debris.
United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS)
: Sets space debris mitigation guidelines.
International Telecommunication Union (ITU):
Regulates satellite orbital slots to prevent overcrowding.
Steps taken by India
Debris Free Space Mission (DFSM):
ISRO is committed to achieving a debris-free space environment by 2030 through passivation, active de-orbiting, and controlled re-entry of spent rocket stages.
The implementation of this DFSM initiative will start by the beginning of 2025.
This includes selecting clean orbits, budgeting fuel for post-mission disposal, and precisely controlling re-entry trajectories.
ISRO’s Debris Mitigation Strategy:
India’s space agency, ISRO, follows international guidelines, including the IADC's recommendation to limit post-mission orbital life to 25 years.
IS4OM (ISRO System for Safe and Sustainable Space Operations Management):
Monitors space debris and orbital decay, ensuring compliance with mitigation guidelines.
Re-entry of PSLV- C37 upper stage
On October 6, 2024, the upper stage of ISRO's PSLV-C37 mission, launched in February 2017, re-entered Earth's atmosphere.
The PSLV-C37 carried 104 satellites, including Cartosat-2D as the primary payload.
After the mission, the upper stage (PS4) remained in orbit at approximately 470x494 km.
Over time, its orbit decayed due to atmospheric drag and was closely monitored by ISRO and US Space Command (USSPACECOM).
Re-entry followed international debris mitigation guidelines
This re-entry followed international debris mitigation guidelines, specifically the IADC recommendation to limit the post-mission orbital life to 25 years.
ISRO's passivation sequence successfully lowered PS4’s orbit,
ensuring re-entry within eight years
ISRO is now working to further reduce the orbital lifetime of rocket stages to five years through active de-orbiting, with future missions focusing on controlled re-entry.
ISRO also aims to achieve a Debris Free Space Mission (DFSM) by 2030.
