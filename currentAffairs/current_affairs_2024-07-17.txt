Govt to Review Clean air Action Plan of Cities
Why in the News?
The review of air quality improvement action plans of 131 cities is likely to be held by the Government this month as part of the Centre’s 100-day agenda.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About NCAP (Objectives, Key Features, Progress, Challenges, etc.)
About National Clean Air Programme (NCAP):
National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is a comprehensive initiative launched by the Government of India to tackle the pressing issue of air pollution across the country.
Initiated in
January 2019
by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC),
NCAP aims to systematically reduce air pollution levels and improve air quality through a multi-pronged approach
The primary objective of NCAP is to achieve a
40% reduction in particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentrations by 2026
, taking 2017 as the base year.
The program targets both short-term and long-term measures to mitigate air pollution across various sectors.
City-Specific Plans
NCAP focuses on
131 non-attainment cities identified by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), where air quality standards have consistently been exceeded
Each city has developed customized action plans that address local sources of pollution, such as vehicular emissions, industrial discharges, dust from construction activities, and waste burning.
Monitoring and Enforcement
Strengthening the existing air quality monitoring network with the addition of more monitoring stations and sensors to provide real-time data.
Enhancing enforcement of air quality regulations and ensuring strict compliance with emission norms.
Public Awareness and Participation
Conducting awareness campaigns to educate citizens about the health impacts of air pollution and promoting community participation in pollution control activities.
Encouraging the adoption of cleaner technologies and practices by industries, businesses, and households.
Inter-Agency Coordination
Facilitating coordination between various government departments, including transport, urban development, agriculture, and power, to implement integrated pollution control measures.
Establishing inter-ministerial task forces and committees to oversee the implementation and progress of the NCAP.
Technological and Financial Support
Promoting the adoption of clean technologies through financial incentives and subsidies.
Allocating funds to states and municipalities to support the implementation of their respective action plans.
Research and Development
Encouraging scientific research to develop innovative solutions for air pollution control.
Collaborating with academic institutions and research organizations to study the sources and health impacts of air pollution.
PRANA ( Portal for Regulation of Air-pollution in Non-Attainment cities)
, is a portal for monitoring of implementation of NCAP.
Progress & Challenges of NCAP:
Air Information Centers and Pollution Forecasting:
Goal:
Establish air information centres at central and regional levels by 2020.
Status:
Only the central PRANA portal by CPCB is functional.
Implement air pollution forecasting systems in non-attainment cities by 2022.
Only Delhi has a functional system.
Committee Setup and Utilization of Funds:
Committees:
Proposed at various levels, but issues remain with functionality, transparency, and public information.
Fund Utilization:
Of ₹1,253 crore allocated to 82 non-attainment cities, only ₹498 crore (40%) was used.
Of ₹9,610 crore allocated to 49 million-plus cities, ₹5,909 crore (62%) was utilized, indicating significant underutilization.
Monitoring Stations:
Increase manual monitoring stations under NAMP from 703 to 1,500 by 2024.
Only 931 manual stations operational, showing a critical shortfall.
Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS):
Establish 150 stations.
531 stations are operational, indicating very good progress.
Rural Monitoring Network:
Current:
26 manual stations.
Set up 100 stations by 2024.
Full realization of this goal seems difficult.
Source Apportionment:
Only 44 out of 131 non-attainment cities conducted source apportionment studies.
Data Availability and Compliance:
Data Availability:
227 cities had over 75% data availability days in 2023, with 85 under NCAP and 142 not covered by NCAP.
PM10 Levels:
78 NCAP cities and 118 non-NCAP cities exceeded National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM10.
Govt to Review Clean air Action Plan of Cities:
The upcoming meeting will review the actions taken by city administrations in key areas like dust control, electric vehicle charging stations, public transport improvement, waste management, and urban greening.
Ministry's review aims to ensure quick utilization of funds, especially as the National Green Tribunal scrutinizes the NCAP for unused funds
Submissions to the tribunal revealed that
many cities spent funds on non-essential projects such as football grounds, water fountains, and desludging machines

**********What constitutes a Money Bill
Why in news?
The Supreme Court has agreed to consider petitions challenging the government's use of the "Money Bill route" to pass contentious legislation in Parliament.
The issue of which Bills can be designated as Money Bills was referred to a seven-judge Bench in November 2019 by a five-judge Bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi in the case of Rojer Mathew vs South Indian Bank Ltd.
In October 2023, CJI Chandrachud announced that the seven-judge Bench would be established soon.
What’s in today’s article?
Difference between finance bill and money bill
Important bill passed using money bill route
The important cases in SC
Article 110 defines a money Bill as one containing provisions dealing with taxes, regulation of the government’s borrowing of money, and expenditure or receipt of money from the Consolidated Fund of India, among others.
Article 109 delineates the procedure for the passage of such a Bill and confers an overriding authority on the Lok Sabha in the passage of money Bills.
Under Article 109, a Money Bill shall be introduced only in Lok Sabha and, upon passage, transmitted to
Rajya Sabha for its recommendations
Rajya Sabha must revert within 14 days, but it is up to Lok Sabha to accept or reject any or all of its recommendations. If the Bill is not returned b
Speaker certifies a Bill as a Money Bill, and the Speaker’s decision is final
Under Article 110(3)
, If any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of the Speaker of the House of the People thereon shall be final.
Over the last seven years, the government has introduced multiple legislations through the money Bill route, the most notable of which are the
Aadhaar Act, 2016
, and the Finance Act, 2017.
Difference between money Bills and financial Bills
While all
Money Bills are Financial Bills, all Financial Bills are not Money Bills
E.g., the Finance Bill which only contains provisions related to tax proposals would be a Money Bill.
However, a Bill that contains some provisions related to taxation or expenditure, but also covers other matters would be considered as a Financial Bill.
The Compensatory Afforestation Fund Bill, 2015, which establishes funds under the Public Account of India and states, was introduced as a Financial Bill.
The procedure for the passage of the two bills varies significantly.
The Rajya Sabha has no power to reject or amend a Money Bill
After being passed by the Lok Sabha, money Bills are sent to the Rajya Sabha for its recommendations.
Within 14 days, the Upper House must submit the Bill back to the Lower House with its non-binding recommendations.
If the Lok Sabha rejects the recommendations, the Bill is deemed to have passed by both Houses in the form in which it was passed by the Lok Sabha without the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha.
Even if the Rajya Sabha doesn’t respond with its recommendations within 14 days, the same consequences would follow.
However, a Financial Bill must be passed by both Houses of Parliament.
While an ordinary Bill can originate in either house,
a money Bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha
, as laid down in Article 117 (1).
Additionally, no one can introduce or move money Bills in the Lok Sabha, except on the President’s recommendation.
Amendments relating to the reduction or abolition of any tax are exempt from the requirement of the President’s recommendation.
The two prerequisites for any financial Bill to become a money Bill are that
It must only be introduced in the Lok Sabha and not the Rajya Sabha.
These bills can only be introduced on the President’s recommendation.
Money Bills offer a fast-track route to enact legislation because they do not require passage in Rajya Sabha.
Several important laws have been passed by this route in recent years, circumventing the Upper House.
These include: amendments to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, (PMLA) and the Foreign Contributions Regulations Act, 2010, (FCRA) as well as the Aadhaar Act, 2016 etc.
What constitutes a Money Bill: The important cases in SC
Challenge to Aadhaar Act
In September 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act by a 4-1 majority.
Petitioners argued it was improperly passed as a Money Bill, including unrelated provisions.
Justice Ashok Bhushan supported the majority, stating the Act's primary aim was to provide subsidies and benefits, justifying its passage as a Money Bill.
Justice D.Y. Chandrachud dissented, calling it an abuse of the constitutional process, which undermines the Rajya Sabha's role in lawmaking.
The Finance Act, 2017, amended various laws and
allowed the government to set rules for Tribunal members' service conditions
Petitioners argued it should be struck down for including unrelated provisions.
In November 2019, a five-judge Bench invalidated the Tribunal Rules for infringing on judicial independence but referred the Money Bill issue to a larger seven-judge Bench.
The court noted the Aadhaar case did not clearly define a valid Money Bill.
Since 2019
The court has avoided addressing the Money Bill issue in several cases due to the pending seven-judge Bench review.
These cases include challenges to the Enforcement Directorate's wide powers under the PMLA (Finance Act, 2018) and the Centre's Electoral Bond scheme, both facilitated through the Money Bill route.

**********Analysing the Progress of Quantum Technology in India
Why in News?
In 2023, India launched the National Quantum Mission and became one of the few countries in the world to have a dedicated programme to harness the power of quantum technologies.
But India is far behind China and the US despite having a fairly strong research base in quantum science.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is Quantum Technology?
What is the Indian Government’s National Quantum Mission (NQM)?
It is a class of technology (developed in the early 20th century) that
works by using the principles of quantum mechanics
- the physics of subatomic particles, including quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.
Hence, it is based on
phenomena exhibited by microscopic particles
(like photons, electrons, atoms, etc) which are quite distinct from the way normal macroscopic objects behave.
As behaviour of these microscopic particles
can’t be described by Classical Physics
(based on Newtonian Mechanics), consequently Quantum Mechanics came into picture.
The principles behind quantum technology:
Applications:
In more reliable navigation and timing systems, more secure communications, more accurate healthcare imaging through
quantum sensing
(perform a measurement of a physical quantity), more powerful computing (
quantum computer
), etc.
Progress in India:
India is currently at the forefront of tapping the quantum revolution through massive investments in the field.
The Union Budget 2020-21
proposed to spend
₹8,000 crore on the newly launched National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications (
NMQTA
) and
₹ 3660 Crore for National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems (
NM-ICPS
).
NQM will be led by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) for
strengthening India’s R&D in the quantum arena
, and focuses on
four key domains:
computing, communications, sensors, and materials.
It will target
developing intermediate scale quantum computers
with 50-1000 physical qubits in eight years in various platforms like superconducting and photonic technology.
Other objectives of the mission:
Satellite based secure quantum communications
over a range of 2000 km within India and with other countries.
Develop magnetometers
with high sensitivity in atomic systems and
Atomic Clocks
for precision timing, communications and navigation.
It will also support design and synthesis of quantum materials such as
superconductors, novel semiconductor structures and topological materials
for fabrication of quantum devices.
Four ‘Thematic Hubs’ (T-Hubs)
will be set up in top academic and national R&D institutes in the domains of quantum computing, communication, sensing and metrology.
The hubs will focus on
generation of new knowledge
through basic and applied research as well as promote R&D.
The Mission will have wide-scale applications ranging from
healthcare and diagnostics, defence, energy and data security.
Analysing the Progress of Quantum Technology in India:
India lagging behind other nations:
A new report has found that countries like
China and the US have a huge head start
in quantum technologies over India.
Not only have these nations
invested significantly more funds to research
, they have a larger number of professionals in this field, have been publishing more scientific papers, and have registered many more patents.
India still remains in competition:
Indian scientists are at the
forefront of research into quantum communications and quantum sensing.
Even in areas such as computing and materials,
the gap is not such that it cannot be bridged.
Outside the European Union, India had the largest number of graduate students in disciplines (biochemistry, electronics, statistics, ICT, etc) aligned to quantum technologies.
There were more than 82,000 such students enrolled, which is more than in China or the US.
Way ahead for India:
In a decade or two, a quantum-enabled transition can lay the groundwork for a new economy by surpassing the limitations of existing technology. This is why India wants to rapidly build its capabilities in these areas.
Partnering in technology development
would ensure early success, leading to swift economic progress and access to cutting-edge technologies for India.
The NQM needs to identify and promote young talent
, helping to raise a separate cadre of quantum scientists.
Conclusion:
There is much ground to cover, and the NQM is only the first step. But the good thing is that India is not exactly starting from zero.
