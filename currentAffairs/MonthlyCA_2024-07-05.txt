Bihar’s Demand for Special Category Status
Source: TH
Why in News?
Recently, the Bihar
Chief Minister
reiterated the State’s long-standing demand to be granted
special category status
by the Centre, a move that would increase the amount of
tax revenues
that the State gets from the Centre.
Why is Bihar Demanding Special Category Status (SCS)?
Historical and Structural Challenges:
Bihar faces significant
economic challenges
, including a lack of
industrial development
and limited
investment opportunities.
The bifurcation of the state resulted in the
shifting of industries
to Jharkhand, exacerbating the employment and economic growth issues in Bihar.
Natural Calamities:
The state grapples with
natural calamities
like floods in the northern region and severe droughts in the southern part.
These recurring disasters
disrupt
agricultural activities
, especially in terms of
irrigation facilities
and the water supply remains inadequate affecting livelihoods and economic stability.
Lack of Infrastructure:
Bihar's inadequate infrastructure hampers its overall development, characterised by
poor road networks, limited healthcare access, and challenges in educational facilities.
In 2013, the
Raghuram Rajan Committee
set up by the Centre, placed Bihar in the
“least developed category”.
Poverty and Social Development:
Bihar has a
high poverty rate
, with a significant number of families living below the poverty line.
A recent survey by NITI Aayog reveals that Bihar is the state with the highest number of poor with
26.59% multidimensionally poor
in 2022-23 which is much higher than the national average of
11.28%.
Per-capita GDP of Bihar is Rs. 60,000 compared to Rs. 1,69,496 as the National average for 2022-23.
The state also lags in various
human development indicators
as well.
Funding for Development:
Seeking SCS is also a means to secure
substantial financial assistance
from the central government to address long-standing socio-economic challenges.
The Bihar government last year estimated that the granting of the special category status will help the State receive a
n additional 2.5 lakh crore rupees
over five years to spend on the
welfare of 94 lakh crore poor families.
What are the Arguments Against Bihar Getting the SCS?
However, some critics argue that increased funds might
incentivise poor policies
and penalise well-performing states, as the funds will be diverted to poorer states.
Historically
rule of law
in Bihar has been a major barrier to growth and investment.
The Centre already
devolves 42% of taxes from earlier 32% to states
as per the 14
Finance Commission. Any
additional strain on the Centre's funds
will potentially impact other national schemes and welfare measures.
Bihar is one of the fastest-growing states in India
. In 2022-23, Bihar’s GDP grew by 10.6%, higher than the national average of 7.2%.
Per capita income in real terms grew by 9.4% in the previous year.
More funds might offer
short-term relief
, but long-term growth depends on
improving
governance
and investment climate.
Although Bihar meets most of the criteria for the grant of SCS, it does not fulfil the
requirement of hilly terrain
geographically difficult areas
, which is considered to be the primary reason for difficulty in infrastructural development.
Central government
citing the
FC report
which made a recommendation to the Centre that
no State be accorded the SCS,
repeatedly denied the demands.
What is a Special Category Status?
About:
SCS is a classification given by the Centre
to assist the development of states that face geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.
Constitution
not make a provision
for SCS and this classification was later done on the recommendations of the
in 1969.
Status was first accorded to
Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and Nagaland
Telangana
is the newest State of India to be accorded the status.
SCS is different from Special status
which imparts enhanced legislative and political rights, while SCS deals with
only economic
and financial aspects.
For instance, J&K used to have Special status before
Article 370
was repealed.
Parameters (Based on
Gadgil Formula
):
Hilly Terrain
Low Population Density and/or Sizeable
Share of Tribal Population
Strategic
Location along Borders
with Neighbouring Countries
Economic and
Infrastructure Backwardness
Nonviable Nature of State Finances
Benefits:
Centre pays 90%
of the funds required in a
Centrally-Sponsored Scheme
to special category status states as
against 60% or 75% in the case of other states,
while the remaining funds are provided by the state governments.
Unspent money
in a financial year
does not lapse
and is carried forward.
Significant concessions are provided to these states in excise and customs duties, income tax and corporate tax.
30% of the Centre’s Gross Budget goes to Special Category states.
Resource Allocation:
Granting SCS entails providing additional financial assistance to the state, which can
strain the central government's resources
Dependency on Central Assistance:
States with SCS often become
heavily reliant
on central assistance discouraging efforts toward
self-sufficiency
and independent economic growth strategies.
Implementation Challenges:
Even after the grant of SCS, there might be
challenges in utilising
the funds effectively due to administrative inefficiencies,
corruption
, or lack of proper planning.
Way Forward
There is a
need to revisit and refine the criteria
for granting SCS to ensure
fairness and transparency.
set up by the Centre suggested a new methodology based on a
‘multi-dimensional index’
for devolving funds instead of a SCS, which can be r
evisited to address the State’s socio-economic backwardness.
Implement policies that
gradually reduce states' dependency on central assistance
by promoting
self-sufficiency and economic diversification
. Encourage states to generate their revenue streams.
Analysts suggest that Bihar needs a stronger rule of law for
sustainable economic growth.
Other steps need to be taken
to encourage states to
create comprehensive development plans
including:
Education Revamp:
The recommendations of the
RTE Forum
, a consortium of experts focus on improving
early childhood development
ICDS centres
), teacher training, and pedagogy shifts towards a more interactive and technology-integrated approach.
Skilling and Job Creation:
Bihar's youth bulge needs
skilled opportunities.
Focus should be on skilling initiatives aligned with growing industries, alongside fostering entrepreneurship through programs like the SIPB
(Single-window Investment Promotion Board)
to attract businesses and create a job market.
Infrastructure Development:
Improved infrastructure is crucial for overall growth. The focus should be on better irrigation systems to
tackle
, alongside developing a robust transport network to connect rural and urban areas, attracting investment and boosting agricultural trade.
Women's Empowerment and Social Inclusion:
Bihar faces challenges with
gender equality
and social stratification. Initiatives focused on
women's education
skill development
financial inclusion
alongside tackling social inequalities through stricter enforcement of laws and promoting social harmony.
Drishti Mains Question:
Q. Discuss the challenges in granting Special Category Status (SCS) to states in India. How do these challenges impact the fiscal federalism and development objectives of the country?
