The gender budget — bigger allocations, little impact
Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Gender Budget; Vulnerable class issues;
Why in the News?
The Union Budget 2025-26 has increased funding for women-centric schemes to ₹4.49 lakh crore, a 37.25% rise from ₹3.27 lakh crore in the previous year. This increase remains significant even after accounting for an estimated inflation rate of 3.61%.
What are the major reasons for the underutilisation of funds allocated under the Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP)?
Bureaucratic Delays and Complex Procedures:
In many states, lengthy approval processes and multi-tiered administrative hurdles delay fund disbursement, preventing timely implementation of welfare schemes. The “Post-Matric Scholarship for SC/ST Students” often faces delays due to slow bureaucratic processing.
Lack of Community Involvement in Planning:
The absence of direct consultation with SC/ST communities results in schemes that do not align with their specific needs.
In tribal areas, the lack of local representation has led to the failure of livelihood programs tailored for forest-based communities.
Inadequate Awareness and Outreach:
Many eligible beneficiaries are unaware of available programs due to poor dissemination of information. Despite a substantial allocation to the
“Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana,”
low awareness among SC/ST households has limited its reach.
Underutilisation due to Misallocation:
Funds intended for targeted development are often diverted to general welfare projects, reducing the impact on SC/ST communities. In some states, funds under the TSP have been used for infrastructure projects that do not directly benefit tribal populations.
Digital and Procedural Barriers:
The shift to digital application processes without adequate digital literacy programs has excluded many SC/ST beneficiaries. In Rajasthan, digitization of welfare schemes like
“PVTG Development Programmes”
has created barriers for those lacking internet access or digital skills.
Why is the lack of gender-disaggregated data within SCSP and TSP a major challenge in assessing the impact on SC/ST women?
Inability to Measure Gender-Specific Outcomes
: Without data distinguishing male and female beneficiaries, it’s challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives aimed at SC/ST women.
For instance, literacy rates among SC women stand at 56.5%, and among ST women at 49.4%, compared to the national female literacy rate of 64.63%.
Failure to Address Intersectional Disparities:
SC/ST women experience layered discrimination based on caste, gender, and class. Without data distinguishing their experiences, policies fail to address these overlapping vulnerabilities.
For example, in tribal areas, women’s access to maternal healthcare remains poor because gender-specific needs are not reflected in TSP allocations.
Ineffective Policy Design and Implementation:
The absence of gender-specific data prevents the government from designing targeted interventions and monitoring their effectiveness.
In the
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin)
, there is no separate data on SC/ST women beneficiaries, making it difficult to assess if they are receiving adequate housing support.
How has digitalisation created new barriers for women, particularly those from marginalised communities?
Limited Digital Literacy and Access:
Many women from SC/ST and other marginalised groups lack basic digital skills, making it difficult to access welfare schemes and online services. For instance, beneficiaries of the
Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
often struggle to navigate digital banking platforms, leading to dependency on intermediaries.
Exclusion Due to Lack of Digital Infrastructure:
Poor digital infrastructure in rural and tribal areas limits women’s ability to participate in digital governance processes. For example, the Aadhaar-linked Public Distribution System (PDS) often fails to deliver benefits to women in remote regions due to biometric authentication issues.
Increased Dependence on Intermediaries:
Digital processes intended to reduce corruption have increased reliance on middlemen for those who cannot navigate online systems. For instance, women applying for the
PM Ujjwala Yojana
face difficulties completing online applications, forcing them to seek help and sometimes pay additional fees.
Case study:
What lessons can be drawn from Kerala’s Kudumbashree mission to improve the effectiveness of gender budgets?
Community-Led Participatory Approach:
Involving women from the grassroots level in planning, implementation, and monitoring ensures that schemes address their real needs. For instance, Kudumbashree’s neighbourhood groups empower women to influence local budget decisions, ensuring better allocation and utilisation of resources.
Transparent Monitoring and Accountability:
Regular audits and community-based tracking improve fund utilisation and prevent leakages. For example, Kudumbashree’s micro-level monitoring system tracks welfare schemes, ensuring funds reach the intended beneficiaries and improving service delivery.
Way forward:
Strengthen Data Systems and Targeted Monitoring:
Implement gender-disaggregated and caste-specific data collection within SCSP and TSP to track the impact on SC/ST women and address intersectional vulnerabilities effectively.
Enhance Digital and Community Accessibility:
Invest in digital literacy programs and community-based facilitation to ensure equitable access to welfare schemes, especially for women in rural and marginalised communities.
Mains PYQ:
Distinguish between gender equality, gender equity and women’s empowerment. Why is it important to take gender concerns into account in programme design and implementation?

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Three-Stage Cycle of Addiction
Why in the News?
A groundbreaking study at the University of British Columbia, published in
Nature Mental Health
, reveals that
addiction involves a complex neural circuit
regulating cravings, emotions, and decision-making, shifting approaches to treatment and recovery.
Key Findings of the Research:
Addiction Alters a Network of Brain Regions:
A multi-center study analyzing
144 neuroimaging studies
with
9,000 participants
confirmed that addiction
does not affect isolated brain areas
but rather disrupts a
circuit responsible for craving, emotional regulation, and decision-making
Brain’s Reward System is Hijacked:
The
nucleus accumbens
releases
dopamine
, reinforcing pleasurable behaviors. Addictive substances
exploit this mechanism
, making substance use
compulsive over time
Withdrawal Causes Emotional Distress:
extended amygdala
triggers
stress, anxiety, and irritability
when substance use stops, driving continued consumption to
avoid discomfort
Decision-Making is Impaired:
prefrontal cortex weakens
, reducing
impulse control and rational thinking
, making quitting
extremely difficult
despite awareness of harm.
Adolescents are More Vulnerable:
Since the
prefrontal cortex matures last
, early substance exposure
increases long-term addiction risk
Neuroadaptations Persist Even After Abstinence:
Brain changes caused by addiction
do not immediately reverse
, leading to
relapse vulnerability
even after long periods of sobriety.
The Three-Stage Cycle of Addiction
Binge/Intoxication Stage (Basal Ganglia – Reward Processing)
Substance use
triggers dopamine release
Over time, the
brain associates substance use with intense rewards
, increasing
dependence
Users experience
, leading to compulsive drug-seeking behavior.
Withdrawal/Negative Affect Stage (Extended Amygdala – Emotional Distress)
When substance use stops, individuals
experience withdrawal symptoms
like
stress, anxiety, and depression
The brain craves relief
, pushing individuals toward
continued substance use
to avoid
This stage
makes quitting extremely difficult
, reinforcing addiction.
Preoccupation/Anticipation Stage (Prefrontal Cortex – Impulse Control & Cravings)
, impairing
decision-making and self-control
dominate thoughts
obsessive focus on substance use
Despite knowing the
negative consequences
struggle to quit
due to impaired
cognitive function
This cycle
continuously repeats
, making addiction
a self-reinforcing loop
