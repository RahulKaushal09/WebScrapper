**********Understanding the Delay in the Teesta Water Sharing Treaty
Why in news?
During the recent state visit of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India, PM Modi announced that a technical team would soon visit Bangladesh to discuss the conservation and management of the Teesta River.
This remark has reignited speculation about the long-pending Teesta water sharing treaty, a crucial bilateral agreement that has remained unresolved for over a decade.
What’s in today’s article?
Teesta Water Sharing Proposal
About
It is a tributary of the Jamuna River (Brahmaputra River) and it flows through India and Bangladesh.
Origin and course
Teesta river originates from the Tso Lhamo Lake at an elevation of about 5,280 metres in north Sikkim.
After that, it flows to the south, cutting a deep gorge through the Siwalik Hills east of Darjiling (in West Bengal, India), and turns southeast to run through the Sivok Khola pass onto the plains of West Bengal.
Countries:
The Teesta River flows through two countries:
India: Sikkim and West Bengal
Bangladesh: The river enters Bangladesh in the Rangpur Division, eventually merging with the Brahmaputra River.
The major tributaries of Teesta River
Left-bank Tributaries: Lachung Chhu, Chakung Chhu, Dik Chhu, Rani Khola, Rangpo Chhu.
Right-bank Tributaries – Zemu Chhu, Rangyong Chhu, Rangit River.
Significance for India and Bangladesh
Teesta is Bangladesh’s fourth largest trans-boundary river and its floodplain covers an area of 2,750 square kilometres in Bangladesh.
But 83% of the river’s catchment area lies in India and the remaining 17% is in Bangladesh, supporting 8.5% of its population and 14% of its crop production.
2011 Proposal
Water Distribution
The draft agreement proposed an equitable distribution of the Teesta River's water between India and Bangladesh.
As per this agreement, India was to receive 42.5% and Bangladesh 37.5% of the river's water flow during the lean season (December to March).
The remaining water would be managed according to seasonal variations and mutual needs.
Collaborative Management
The proposal included provisions for joint monitoring and management of the river’s water.
Controversies Surrounding the Proposal
West Bengal’s Opposition
The chief obstacle to the treaty's finalization has been opposition from the Indian state of West Bengal.
The state government expressed concerns that the proposed water sharing would adversely affect West Bengal's irrigation and drinking water needs.
West Bengal's significant dependence on the Teesta River for its agriculture sector added to the reluctance to agree to the terms.
Regional Politics
The issue has become deeply entangled in regional politics.
The West Bengal government's refusal to endorse the agreement reflects broader political dynamics and sensitivities, where state interests are sometimes prioritized over national diplomatic commitments.
Environmental Concerns
Environmentalists in both countries have raised concerns about the potential ecological impacts of altering the river's flow.
The construction of dams and barrages as part of the management strategy could disrupt the river’s ecosystem and negatively affect biodiversity.
In October 2023, a glacial lake outburst triggered floods in the Teesta basin that claimed hundred lives and destroyed the Teesta III hydroelectric dam.
Bangladesh’s Dependence
Bangladesh heavily relies on the Teesta River, especially in the northern region, for agriculture and livelihood.
The country faces significant water shortages during the dry season, exacerbating the need for a fair and reliable water-sharing agreement.
The perception that Bangladesh has historically received less than its fair share of water has fueled public sentiment
and political pressure to secure a favorable deal.
Previous Agreements and Trust Deficit
Historical water-sharing disputes, such as those involving the Ganges River, have led to a trust deficit between the two countries.
This complicates negotiations, as past experiences influence the current dialogue and expectations.
Other issues
As per experts, the dams for hydro-electric power generation in Sikkim and the Teesta Barrage Project at Gazoldoba in West Bengal is making the flow of the river erratic in Bangladesh, leading to either floods or scarcity of water.
China’s interference
In 2020, China proposed major dredging work on the Teesta River and building reservoirs and embankments.
However, the Bangladesh govt has put the proposal on hold for the past four years.
Why is Bengal talking about the Ganga treaty?
The Ganga water sharing treaty with Bangladesh completes 30 years in 2026 and a renewal of the agreement is on the cards.
The Ganga Treaty, signed in 1996 between India and Bangladesh, ensures equitable water sharing of the Ganges River.
Under the treaty the water allocation during the dry season (January to May) is as follows:
India: Receives a minimum of 35,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs) of water at Farakka.
Bangladesh: Receives a minimum of 35,000 cusecs of water at Farakka.
The WB govt has pointed out that water sharing with Bangladesh has changed the Ganga’s morphology and affected lakhs of people in West Bengal owing to river erosion.
Lakhs of people have been displaced from their habitation rendering them homeless and also leading to their loss of livelihood.
The reduced silt load in Hooghly has impeded the nourishment of the Sundarban delta.

**********What was the Tussle over Covaxin IPR?
Why in the News?
Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL), the company that created the Indian coronavirus vaccine
, has admitted to making an unintended mistake in its patent filings. These filings are meant to protect the vaccine’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
Despite being one of India's top biotechnology companies, BBIL forgot to list the scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as co-inventors in the patent documents for Covaxin.
What’s in Today’s Article?
About Patents & IPR (Meaning, Categories, etc.)
About the Controversy (Details, Role of BBIL & ICMR, Conclusion)
What are Patents and IPR?
A patent represents a powerful Intellectual Property Right (IPR), and is an exclusive monopoly granted by a Government to an inventor for a limited, pre-specified time.
It provides an enforceable legal right to prevent others from copying the invention.
Patents can be of two types:
product patent
ensures that the rights to the final product is protected, and anyone other than the patent holder can be restrained from manufacturing it during a specified period.
process patent
enables any person other than the patent holder to manufacture the patented product by modifying certain processes in the manufacturing exercise.
Initially, India adopted process patenting in 1970s which enabled India to become a significant producer of generic drugs at global scale.
However, due to the obligations under the
TRIPS
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement
, product patenting is also allowed in India.
TRIPS is an international legal agreement between all the member nations of the World Trade Organization.
Controversy Surrounding the Covaxin IPR:
explained that they patented the process of making vaccines from virus strains provided by the
ICMR-NIV
(National Institute of Virology).
The ICMR-NIV specializes in extracting viruses from blood samples, identifying their characteristics, conducting tests to measure their infectiousness, and comparing them to related strains.
However, turning this research into a vaccine on an industrial scale requires facilities that only established vaccine manufacturers have.
, the vaccine developed by BBIL, is an inactivated version of the coronavirus that causes
COVID-19
When injected, it stimulates the body to produce antibodies that may protect against severe illness from the virus.
To enhance its effectiveness, an ‘
adjuvant
’ is added to the vaccine.
Vaccine manufacturers have their own methods for combining these steps, and because the field is highly competitive, they try to prevent others from copying their processes to maintain a temporary monopoly and earn profits.
It’s important to note that
while companies can apply for product or process patents in as many countries as they can afford, a patent is only granted after regulatory authorities are convinced that the process is indeed novel or inventive
As far as publicly known,
Bharat Biotech has not yet been granted these patents
What were the Roles of BBIL and ICMR?
BBIL collaborated with ICMR-NIV on every step of developing the Covaxin vaccine. They signed an agreement outlining each organization's responsibilities.
Due to ICMR being a public entity and the scale of the COVID crisis, there were requests to make this agreement public under the Right to Information Act.
Portions of the agreement were revealed in the Rajya Sabha in July 2021.
The agreement specified that beyond providing the virus strains and making the vaccines, ICMR would also test the vaccines on animals—from rodents to monkeys—and then on humans to ensure the vaccine's efficacy.
ICMR funded these clinical trials with ₹35 crore and incurred costs in developing Covaxin
. In return, ICMR was to receive 5% of the royalties BBIL earned from the sale of Covaxin.
Since the collaboration was announced, it was generally understood that both entities would share the intellectual property rights.
Initially, BBIL said that there was a distinction between the rights to make the vaccine and the rights to the data from clinical trials.
They stated that because ICMR had not invested in the actual production of the vaccine, it was not included in the patent applications.
Following public scrutiny,
BBIL admitted to an error and announced plans to file new applications listing ICMR personnel as co-inventors
Conclusion:
IPR is a complex field that covers all aspects of product invention.
Developing pharmaceutical products requires various types of expertise, making it difficult for single firms to handle everything alone.
Companies often enter into multiple licensing agreements, as BBIL did with Virovax for an adjuvant.
When multiple entities collaborate on a single product, being listed as an inventor affects the sharing of IPR, royalties, and product usage.
Disputes over IPR are common across all fields. In patent filings, especially in the U.S., not listing all inventors can result in patent application rejections.

**********Why has the NTA Failed to Deliver
Why in News?
With widespread allegations of cheating, paper leaks and other irregularities impacting flagship examinations such as the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test), the National Testing Agency (NTA) has come under intense fire.
What’s in Today’s Article?
The National Testing Agency (NTA)
Issues Faced by the NTA
What Needs to be Done to Reform India’s Examination Process?
The National Testing Agency (NTA):
Background:
In 2010
, a committee comprising directors of IITs recommended establishing an autonomous and transparent body (NTA) through legislation, modelled after the
Educational Testing Service (ETS) of the US
Prior to the NTA’s formation
, various government bodies like the UGC, the CBSE, and central universities such as Delhi University and JNU conducted their own entrance examinations.
About NTA:
It was set up in
2017
as a
specialist, self-sustaining and autonomous organisation
under the aegis of the
Union Ministry of Education
It is registered under
the Societies Registration Act 1860
, and falls under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
Objectives:
It aims to
Address the challenges of
assessing candidates’ competence
by adhering to international standards, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and error-free delivery.
Conduct efficient and transparent tests
, Research and development and Expert collaboration Information dissemination.
Examinations conducted by the NTA:
JEE (Main), NEET-UG, Common Management Admission Test (CMAT), Graduate Pharmacy Aptitude Test (GPAT) and University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET).
The National Education Policy 2020
envisaged a broader role, recommending that the NTA conduct an entrance or aptitude test for all universities across the country.
In all, the NTA now has charge for more than 20 examinations.
Who runs the NTA?
Its director general and governing body are
appointed by the Union government
The core team of the NTA consists of test item writers, researchers, psychometricians, and education specialists.
The NTA operates six verticals, each focusing on different examinations.
Each vertical employs about six researchers, including internationally recognised experts in psychometrics and statistics.
Issues Faced by the NTA:
Conduct computer-based tests only
This is to ensure that high volume can be processed in a short period of time.
As the NIC [National Informatics Centre] does not have the capacity or IT infrastructure needed, third-party technical partners are being engaged.
However, third-party players
take accountability out of the government’s hands
and leave loopholes in the system which can be exploited by unscrupulous players.
Agency is severely understaffed:
The agency was set up with only about 25 permanent staff positions and its functions have been outsourced to technical partners from the very beginning.
Absence of robust security mechanisms:
These are needed to handle a large-scale pen-and-paper examination, including the
Setting of the question paper and its encryption,
Selection of external printing presses and exam centres,
Transportation to printing presses,
Storage and distribution to examinees at examination centres and
Then the collection and transportation of answer sheets to evaluation centres.
Each of these is a stage where malpractice can occur without robust security mechanisms.
NEET and UGC-NET exams irregularities:
The NTA faced severe criticism after it
awarded grace marks to 1,563 candidates
in the NEET exam due to delays at seven examination centres.
This decision led to accusations of inflated marks
, culminating in a record 67 candidates sharing the top rank.
The integrity of the NEET-UG was further compromised when the
exam question paper was allegedly leaked.
Similarly, the UGC-NET exam was cancelled a day after being conducted, following reports that its integrity had been breached.
Radhakrishnan committee:
The high-level panel headed by former ISRO chief K. Radhakrishnan has been constituted to recommend
Reforms in the examination process,
Improve data security protocols, and
Overhaul the NTA’s functioning.
Adding manpower and infrastructure to the NTA:
To equip it to take on large-scale pen-and-paper examinations, as these are more equitable, especially for students in rural and remote areas with little access to technology.
Dismantling the centralisation process
: More decentralised structures are needed to meet the vastly differing needs of institutions.
More radical reform of the assessment system:
This includes
Periodic assessments of knowledge,
Concept-based understanding, and
Aptitude can be included in the final years of school education as the precursor to the admission process, etc.
