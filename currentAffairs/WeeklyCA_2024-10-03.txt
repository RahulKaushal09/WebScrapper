Reforming Bail Provisions
Source: HT
Why in News?
Recently, the
Supreme Court (SC)
disapproved of using the
Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
“as a tool” to prolong the
incarceration
of an accused.
It ruled that
constitutional courts
will not allow
indefinite pretrial
detention
under the anti-money laundering law.
What are the Key Points of SC's Ruling on PMLA and Bail?
No Arbitrary Detention:
Although there is a
prima facie
case
against an accused, the court can rule in favour of his release due to the
prolonged detention
without a clear timeline for the trial.
Stringent provisions of the
PMLA, 2002,
especially
Section 45
, should not result in
arbitrary detention
of the accused.
According to
Section 45 of the PMLA
bail can be granted to an accused in a money laundering case only if two conditions are satisfied.
The person has to prove in court that he or she is
prima facie innocent
of the offence.
The accused should be able to
convince
the judge s/he would
not commit any offence
while on bail.
Bail Principles Affirmed:
The court reaffirmed the principle that “
bail is the rule, and jail is the exception
” in India’s criminal jurisprudence.
It was noted that the high threshold for bail under PMLA must not lead to an
indefinite loss of personal liberty
for the accused.
Judicial Concerns on Delayed Trials:
The ruling highlighted the intersection of
delayed trials
harsh bail provisions
under special laws like
PMLA, 2002, or
UAPA, 1967
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS)
expeditious disposal of trials
is necessary and should be integrated into the interpretation of these laws.
Judicial Authority to Grant Bail:
The SC reiterated that stringent
do not stop constitutional courts from intervening in cases where trials are
excessively delayed.
The Supreme Court referenced its
2021 judgement in the
KA Najeeb case
that recognised inordinate delays in trials as a
ground of bail in UAPA cases
Impact on Fundamental Rights:
Excessive delays in trials could infringe on the
fundamental rights
of individuals under
Article 21
of the Constitution, which guarantees the
right to life and personal liberty
Prolonged incarceration
without trial can result in unjust deprivation of liberty, highlighting cases where individuals were acquitted after years of detention.
Potential Claims for Compensation:
The SC suggested that individuals who suffer wrongful imprisonment may have grounds for
compensation
due to violations of their rights under Article 21.
What are the Concerns Regarding India's Bail System?
High Proportion of Undertrials:
Over
75%
of India’s prison population comprises
undertrials
overcrowding
in prisons is reported at
118%
This situation reflects systemic inefficiencies in the bail system that need urgent reform.
The Supreme Court of India, in
Satender Kumar Antil vs CBI, 2022
acknowledged the
failings of the country's bail system
in recognizing the issue of
undertrial and granting bail.
Undermines Principle of 'Presumption of Innocence'
: Crowding of jails with undertrial prisoners undermines the
principle of 'presumption of innocence'
Presumption of innocence is a legal principle that states that a person shall have the
right to be presumed innocent
until proven guilty according to law.
Lack of Empirical Evidence:
Information regarding the
demographics of undertrials, category of offences and timelines for bail,
proportion of undertrials applying for bail, the acceptance or rejection rates of bail applications, and the challenges in bail compliance remain is not widely available.
Lack of Safeguards:
The arrest of a person is justified as
‘necessary’
if the police have
‘reasons to believe’
that arrest is required to ensure their presence in court.
Many arrested individuals, particularly from
disadvantaged sections
of society, remain unprotected.
Challenges in Bail Adjudication:
The power to grant bail is largely based on the c
ourt’s discretion
and depends on the
facts of each case.
Bail is denied based on the
gravity of the offence, character of the accused and likelihood
of the accused absconding or tampering with evidence.
Challenges in Bail Compliance:
A large number of undertrials continue to remain in prison despite being granted bail due to challenges in
complying
with bail conditions.
Bail conditions in the nature of
cash bonds, surety bond, proof of property ownership and solvency,
make it harder for poors to secure their release.
Flawed Assumptions:
The bail system has flawed assumptions that every arrested person will be
propertied
or have access to
propertied social connections.
It presumes that the
risk of financial loss
is necessary to ensure the presence of the accused in court.
What are Supreme Court judgments Regarding Bail System?
Babu Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh Case, 1978
: Bail should
generally be granted
unless there are substantial grounds for believing that the accused will abscond or tamper with evidence.
State of Rajasthan v. Balchand Case, 1978
: SC held that
Bail is the rule and Jail is an Exception.
Detention of a person affects his right to life and liberty and the main objective of detention is to ensure easy availability of an accused for trial without any inconvenience.
Parvez NoordinLokhandwalla v. State of Maharashtra Case, 2020
It was noted that bail conditions should
not be excessive
compared to their intended purpose.
Satender Kumar Antil v CBI Case, 2022
Courts must ensure that
strict bail conditions
do not disproportionately affect the accused.
Way Forward
Simplification of Bail Conditions:
Reassess and
simplify bail conditions
to make them more accessible, particularly for individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
E.g.
Community service
as alternative to cash and surety bonds.
Safeguards Against Arbitrary Arrests:
Introduce strict guidelines and safeguards to protect against
arbitrary arrests
, particularly for vulnerable populations.
Police must provide
clear justification for arrests
Community-Based Supervision Programs:
Develop
community-based supervision
programs as alternatives to incarceration.
These programs could involve monitoring undertrials through local organisations or social workers, rather than relying solely on bail.
Alternative to Petty Criminals:
Petty criminals awaiting trial could be ordered to stay in
reformatory facilities
where they can engage in useful labour, such as
volunteer work
Speedy Trials:
Supreme Court Committee on Prison Reforms
headed by Justice (retd) Amitava Roy underlined that
speedy trial
can become an
effective tool
to address the issue of overcrowding in jails.
Adequate Infrastructure:
The report
“Empirical study to evaluate the delivery of justice through improved infrastructure”
issued by the Ministry of Law and Justice highlighted that increased
space of courtrooms, availability of basic furniture, digital infrastructure, and skilled manpower
can reduce the number of under-trial prisoners.
Clear Legal Provisions
Clearly defined laws
help individuals understand their rights and responsibilities,
decreasing the chances of prolonged detention
caused by misunderstandings.

Examine the challenges associated with accessing bail in India and suggest measures for a more equitable bail provision framework.
