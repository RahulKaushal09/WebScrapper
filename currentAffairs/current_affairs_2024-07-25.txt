An Outlining of Urban Transformation Strategies
Context
Urbanisation in India has been a defining trend of the 21st century
, with cities becoming the epicentres of economic and social development.
Home to approximately 500 million people, which accounts for about 36% of India's population,
urban areas are witnessing a steady population growth rate
of 2% to 2.5% annually.
Recognising the growing pace of urbanisation and the crucial role of cities as growth hubs,
the new government’s maiden Budget introduces a variety of initiatives aimed at creating planned development and growth in urban areas.
Strategies Outlined in the Budget to Address the City Development
Proposal to Expand the PMAY Scheme in Urban Areas
Since its implementation in 2015, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) has made significant strides.
Thus far,
this scheme has provided around 8.5 million housing units
for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Middle-Income Groups (MIG), with an investment of approximately ₹8 lakh crore.
The
Budget proposes to boost this scheme by supporting the construction of an additional 10 million housing units in urban areas
, involving an investment of ₹10 lakh crore, including ₹2.2 lakh crore in central assistance over the next five years.
For the current year, ₹30,171 crore has been allocated
, part of which will subsidise interest to facilitate affordable loans.
Housing Plans for Migrant Workers in Cities
For the migrant population
working in industries,
the Budget addresses the acute need for adequate housing through the introduction of new rental housing
with dormitory-type accommodations for industrial workers.
This
initiative is planned to be developed in a public-private partnership (PPP) mode, with upfront financial support under the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme
, covering 20% from the central government and potentially similar support from state governments.
Development and Upgradation of Core Infrastructure Requirements
Urban infrastructure, encompassing water supply, sanitation, roads, and sewerage systems, is fundamental to city development.
Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) has allocated ₹8,000 crore for these purposes.
Although this amount may appear modest,
the finance minister has announced the availability of the VGF window
for projects undertaken as commercial ventures in PPP mode.
Given cities' familiarity with the PPP model, this provision could accelerate the development and upgrading of essential infrastructure.
Additionally,
the Budget speech highlights a significant investment of ₹11.11 lakh crore for capital expenditure in infrastructure,
including highways and other sectors, from which cities can benefit.
A provision of ₹1.50 lakh crore is also made available to states as an interest-free loan
for infrastructure development, which states could use for urban projects.
Some Other Key Announcements Related to Smart Cities, Planned City Development
Smart Cities and Digital Transformation
Launched in 2015,
the Smart Cities Mission received ₹8,000 crore in budgetary support in 2023-24, which has been reduced to ₹2,400 crore for 2024-25
to meet residual commitments.
However,
a new initiative, the National Urban Digital Mission (NUDM), has been introduced with a provision of ₹1,150 crore
, focusing on the digitization of property and tax records and their management with GIS mapping.
digital transformation will enable urban local bodies to manage their finances more effectively and assist property owners.
Budget emphasises the importance of planned city development,
allocating ₹25,653 crore as the normal ‘Finance Commission Grant’ for municipalities.
Additionally, ₹500 crore has been set aside for the incubation of new cities
. The
development of mass rapid transit systems allows cities to pursue transit-oriented development,
where dense development around transit hubs can occur without overwhelming road traffic.
Enhanced focus on economic and transit planning
, alongside orderly development of peri-urban areas using town planning schemes, is proposed.
Budget also allocates ₹1,300 crore to encourage electric bus systems in cities
, addressing the challenge of high upfront costs and promoting eco-friendly transportation.
Solid Waste Management
Solid waste management (SWM) poses one of the biggest challenges for urban areas.
Budget proposes introducing bankable projects for SWM in collaboration with state governments and financial institutions
, leveraging the VGF for this purpose.
Cities like Indore, Madhya Pradesh, have demonstrated how SWM can become financially viable, providing a model for others to follow.
Street Vending and Economic Opportunities
Street Vendors Act, 2014,
aimed at regulating street vendors and protecting their rights, envisages creating street-vending plans and zones.
Budget proposes developing 100 weekly ‘haats’ or street food hubs in select cities.
This initiative aims to make street vending a healthy and safe option for both consumers and vendors.
States are encouraged to facilitate the preparation of street-vending plans
and the development of 'haats' according to local needs.
Purpose of Newly Launched National Urban Digital Mission (NUDM)
Digitisation of Property and Tax Records
The NUDM
aims to digitise property records and tax management systems
, ensuring transparency, accuracy, and efficiency.
Digital records make it easier for property owners to access information and conduct transactions, while also aiding municipal bodies in maintaining up-to-date records and improving revenue collection.
Geographic Information System (GIS) Mapping
Integrating GIS mapping into urban planning
and management
allows for a more precise understanding of spatial data.
technology helps in monitoring land use
, planning infrastructure, and managing resources more effectively.
GIS mapping supports better decision-making processes
by providing detailed visual representations of urban areas.
Financial Management
Improved financial management through digital tools enables urban local bodies to streamline their budgeting
, expenditure tracking, and revenue generation.
By leveraging digital platforms
, municipalities can enhance their financial health, ensuring
that funds are utilised efficiently for urban development projects.
Challenges and Future Prospects
Funding and Resource Allocation
Adequate
funding and resource allocation are critical
to the success of these initiatives.
Ensuring
consistent financial support from both central and state governments is essential
for sustained progress.
Capacity Building
Building the
capacity of urban local bodies to implement and manage digital solutions is vital.
This includes training municipal staff, enhancing technical expertise, and fostering a culture of innovation.
Interoperability and Integration
Ensuring that
various digital systems and platforms are interoperable and integrated seamlessly
is crucial for effective urban management.
This requires standardization of technologies and collaborative efforts among different stakeholders.
Data Privacy and Security
As cities collect and process vast amounts of data,
safeguarding privacy and ensuring data security are paramount.
Robust cybersecurity measures must be implemented
to protect sensitive information and maintain public trust.
Conclusion
The Budget presents a comprehensive approach to urban development
, combining financial provisions and procedural strategies to promote planned urbanisation.
the successful implementation of these initiatives depends on the vision and determination of cities,
represented by municipalities, and guided by state governments.
Crucially, the participation of citizens remains the cornerstone for the success
of any city’s development strategy.

Editorial Analysis
**********Govt proposes self-declaration with regard to proof of origin under Customs law
Why in news?
The Union Budget 2024 has introduced amendments to the Customs Act, easing compliance with value-addition norms that are usually in place to prevent the misuse of concessions agreed upon in a trade agreement.
What’s in today’s article?
Rules of Origin
Changes proposed w.r.t Rules of Origin in Budget 2024
Several breaches in rules of origin
About
Rules of origin are the criteria used to define where a product was made. They determine the
economic nationality of a product in international trade
Criteria for Determining Origin
Wholly Obtained or Produced
- Goods that are completely produced or obtained in a country, such as agricultural products, minerals, and fish.
Substantial Transformation
- Products that have undergone substantial transformation in a country, typically defined by a change in tariff classification, a specific percentage of value added, or specific manufacturing processes.
Benefits of Rules of Origin
Prevention of Trade Deflection
It prevents trade deflection, where goods are routed through countries with the lowest tariffs to take advantage of preferential trade agreements.
Encouragement of Local Manufacturing
By setting specific criteria for substantial transformation, these rules encourage countries to develop local industries and add value within their borders.
Trade Preferences and Economic Integration
They allow countries to grant trade preferences to their partners in FTAs, facilitating economic integration and boosting intra-regional trade.
Fair Trade Practices
Rules of origin ensure that only eligible products benefit from trade preferences, maintaining fair competition.
Customs and Trade Statistics
Accurate determination of origin helps in maintaining proper customs records and compiling trade statistics, which are vital for economic analysis and policy-making.
Protection of Domestic Industries
By defining which products qualify for preferential treatment, rules of origin can protect domestic industries from unfair competition from imported goods that do not meet the origin criteria.
Amendment in Section 28DA of the Customs Act, 1962
The Indian government has amended Section 28DA of the Customs Act, 1962.
Through this, it has replaced the requirement for a "certificate" of origin with a broader "proof" of origin, which can be a certificate or a self-declaration in accordance with a trade agreement.
This change aligns with global customs practices and may be implemented if agreed upon in future trade agreements.
Impact
Tax experts note that this amendment allows for greater flexibility in determining the origin of goods.
However, concerns are raised about
potential breaches in self-certification and the need for high integrity in the exporting countries
to prevent loss of customs revenue for India.
While developed countries have robust tracking systems and use self-certification in FTAs,
India remains cautious due to past experiences with goods being diverted from countries like China via Indonesia and Vietnam
The amendment could impact future free trade agreements (FTAs), such as the one with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes provisions for self-certification.
Breaches in rule of origin
The amendments to the Customs Act allow Indian trade negotiators to choose which foreign exporters can self-certify the origin of goods, but India has faced several breaches in rules of origin.
A report by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) highlighted a suspicious
60-fold increase in silver imports from the UAE
, a country that doesn't produce silver, indicating a possible breach of the rules of origin in the India-UAE FTA.
Strict rules of origin verification norms to address issues related to breaches
In response to the breaches, mentioned above, India implemented strict rules of origin verification norms, known as CAROTAR, in 2020.
The CAROTAR provides the minimum basic information that the importer needs to know before importing goods.
These rules help the importer to ascertain the country of origin, assist Customs Authorities in the smooth clearance of import of goods under FTAs and claim concessional duty.
This move led to concerns from several Southeast Asian countries during the India-ASEAN FTA review.
What needs to be done?
Despite these strict measures, India's trade deficit with ASEAN countries increased to $43.57 billion in FY23, up more than 40% from $25.75 billion in FY22.
Trade experts have noted that
circumventing rules of origin is a recurring issue and that enforcing these rules requires robust customs administration
They also highlighted the
challenge of balancing ease of doing business with trade regulation

**********Removal of indexation benefit on sale of property
Why in news?
The budget 2024 announced the removal of the indexation benefits available on the property sale. Due to this many people who sell their property will now not be able to inflate their purchase price and reduce their capital gains.
What’s in today’s article?
Capital Gain Tax
Indexation benefits
About
A capital gains tax is a tax imposed on the sale of an asset. It is calculated as the difference between the sale price of the property and its purchase price.
Any gain or loss incurred from the sale of a house property may be subject to tax under the 'Capital Gains' head.
Similarly, capital gains or losses may arise from sale of different types of capital assets such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds and other investments.
Types
Depending of the period an asset is held with the owner, there are two types of capital gains - Short-term Capital Gains and Long-term Capital Gains.
Budget 2024 and Capital Gain Tax
For classifying assets into long-term and short-term, there will only be two holding periods: 12 months and 24 months.
The holding period has been removed
All listed securities with a holding period exceeding 12 months are considered Long-Term.
The holding period for all other assets is 24 months
The taxation of Short-Term Capital Gain for listed equity shares, a unit of an equity-oriented fund, and a unit of a business trust has been
increased to 20% from 15
%.
Other financial and non-financial assets which are held for short term shall continue to attract the tax at slab rates.
The limit on the exemption of Long-Term Capital Gains on the transfer of equity shares or equity-oriented units or units of Business Trust has increased from Rs.1 Lakh to Rs.1.25 lakh per year.
However, the rate at which it is taxed has increased from 10% to 12.5%
The tax on long-term capital gains on other financial and non-financial assets is reduced from 20% to
12.5%.
Indexation benefits removed in Budget 2024
The indexation benefit that was previously available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with.
So, any sale of long-term asset made after 23rd July, 2024, will attract tax rate of 12.5% only without indexation benefit.
The indexation benefit, however, can be taken
on the sale of property bought or inherited before 2001
In case of property sale,
indexation helps in adjusting its purchase price according to the prevailing inflation rate
So basically, the adjustment inflates the purchase price of a property considering the inflation over the invested years.
This ultimately brings down the taxable capital gains on the sale of the property.
Through indexation, investors can accurately determine their capital gains and be assured that they are paying taxes only on the real gains after inflation is adjusted.
Calculation
The government releases cost inflation index (CII) numbers to index capital gains on specified assets.
CII number takes into account the prevailing inflation for the particular financial year.
Formula to calculate
the adjusted purchase price using the cost inflation index is:
Indexed cost = Purchase Amount * (CII in year of sale / CII in year of purchase).
Initially, I-T department had set 1981 as the base year and later shifted it to 2001, with a base value of 100.
Each year’s index is computed relative to this base.
This adjustment ensures that the taxable gain reflects the real increase in the asset’s value, not just the effect of inflation.
Example (under the previous tax rules)
Purchase Price of Property: ₹50 lakh
Adjusted Purchase Price (Indexed): ₹64.82 lakh
Sale Price (2024-25): ₹70 lakh
Long-Term Capital Gain (LTCG): ₹5.18 lakh
LTCG Tax Liability: ₹1.036 lakh (20% of Gain)
Example (under new tax rule – Budget 2024)
Gain: ₹20 lakh
LTCG Tax Liability: ₹2.5 lakh (12.5% of Gain)
Possible impact of removal of indexation benefit
Slowdown in the resale market
It may discourage owners of older residential properties and land from selling, as the increased tax liability reduces their potential profit.
Rise in cash transactions
There’s a concern that this change could incentivize under-the-table cash deals to avoid the higher tax burden, counteracting efforts to formalize the real estate sector.
Higher property prices
Sellers may attempt to offset the increased tax burden by raising property prices, effectively transferring the cost to buyers.

**********Climate Change Adaptation vs Mitigation Debate in the Economic Survey 2023-24
Why in News?
The Economic Survey has pointed to flaws and inequities in the global climate action regime and suggested alternative pathways that incorporate lifestyle and behavioural changes.
It also argued that adaptation should get at least as much importance as mitigation.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What’s the Difference Between Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation?
The Economic Survey 2023-24 on Climate Change
What are the Alternative Approaches of Climate Action?
As the climate crisis is increasingly distressing, climate actions fall into one of two broad categories: climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation.
These terms
go hand-in-hand
while navigating through the climate crisis,
but they mean very different things.
Climate change mitigation
means avoiding and reducing emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to prevent the planet from warming to more extreme temperatures.
Climate change adaptation
means altering human behaviour, systems, and ways of life to protect societies, economies, and the environment from the impacts of climate change.
The more are the emissions reduced right now, the easier it will be to adapt to the changes that can no longer be avoided.
Mitigation actions will take decades
to affect rising temperatures, so adapting now to the change will continue to affect us in the foreseeable future.
The Economic Survey 2023-24 on Climate Change:
Ineffective and inequitable international framework for fighting climate change:
It is evident from the fact that none of the targets set by the international framework for fighting climate change has ever been met.
Developing nations were under undue pressure
to attain the 1.5 or 2°C temperature target due to an excessive obsession with this target.
This has diverted their focus and resources away
from the more near-term imperatives of improving the lives of their people.
Hence, a warmer world is more equitable and resilient than a world in which the 1.5℃ threshold was achieved at all costs.
However, it is unclear if the Economic Survey is hinting at a potential shift in India's energy transition trajectory.
Increasing resilience by giving adaptation as much importance as mitigation:
This is because the impacts of climate change are already unfolding, and it is becoming increasingly clear that the
1.5°C target will be breached very soon.
Since climate impacts cannot be stopped, the world must focus on rapid development and adaptation to increase resilience.
rapid improvement in incomes and overall well-being
of the people is the best insurance against climate change.
Mitigation by rich and adaptation by developing countries:
According to the counterargument, at these higher temperatures, the severity of climate impacts will intensify to the point that steps towards increasing resilience would be ineffective.
Hence, it is proposed that the rich and developed countries do the mitigation work while developing countries focus on adaptation.
Hypocrisy of the developed world:
For example,
despite having the greatest historical responsibility, the United States has lagged behind other nations in terms of carbon reduction.
The developed countries as a bloc have not fulfilled any of their emission reduction targets, or their commitments to provide finance or technology to the developing countries.
Calls for more aggressive climate action have been made in an attempt to shift the blame for these mistakes onto the rest of the world.
The international climate architecture is more about preserving the existing world order and less about saving the planet.
the more equitable and effective Kyoto Protocol was eventually replaced by the Paris Agreement.
Scientific organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have strengthened the narrative of the developed countries.
What are the Alternative Approaches Focussing on Climate Change Adaptation?
Building climate resilient infrastructure:
For example, the Central Vista will be a huge improvement over the current set of buildings in the Central Secretariat complex.
Climate proofing:
Climate-proofing is the practice of reducing GHG emissions released from the implementation of a certain investment, as well as increasing its resilience to climate change impacts.
the Smart City mission contains several elements of climate proofing.
Lifestyle and behavioural changes:
For example, India’s
Mission Life
calls for conscious consumption for the well-being of the planet.

Governance
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About GM Mustard Crop
Mains level:
Significance of GM crops
Why in the news?
A two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court delivered a split verdict on Tuesday, July 23, regarding the “environmental release” of Genetically Modified (GM) mustard.
Development and Approval Process:
On September 15, 2015, the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) at Delhi University sought approval from the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) for the environmental release of GM mustard DMH-11.
Biosafety Dossier:
The CGMCP submitted a biosafety dossier to the GEAC, which created a sub-committee to examine its contents. After revisions, the sub-committee submitted its report, inviting comments in September 2016.
GEAC Recommendations:
On May 11, 2017, the GEAC recommended the environmental release of GM mustard, allowing field tests to assess the crop’s effects. However, the Ministry of Environment sent the proposal back for re-examination in March 2018 after receiving several representations.
Deferred Tests:
The GEAC directed the CGMCP to examine the effects of GM mustard on honey bees and soil microbial diversity, but these tests were deferred through 2020-21.
The GEAC-appointed expert committee found that
honeybees do not discriminate between other GM crops
such as genetically engineered canola.
What is the case before the Supreme Court?
Background of the Case:
The case arose from challenges by
environmentalist Aruna Rodrigues
the organization Gene Campaign
against the
GEAC’s
approval for the environmental release of GM mustard, arguing that the decision violated the precautionary principle and lacked proper scientific scrutiny.
Split Verdict:
The Supreme Court delivered a split verdict regarding the approval for the environmental release of
genetically modified (GM) mustard, specifically the hybrid DMH-11.
Justices B.V. Nagarathna and Sanjay Karol had differing opinions on the legality of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee’s (GEAC) decision-making process.
Justice Nagarathna’s Opinion:
Justice Nagarathna held that the GEAC’s approval was flawed and did not follow the necessary procedures, particularly failing to conduct promised field tests. She emphasized that the approval violated public trust and the precautionary principle, which is essential for protecting the environment and public health.
Justice Karol’s Opinion:
In contrast, Justice Karol argued that the
GEAC’s decision was valid
aligned with the development of scientific temper.
He stated that field trials are necessary to assess the environmental safety of GM mustard and that the decision-making process was independent and reasoned.
Unanimous Directives:
Despite the split decision,
both judges agreed
need for the Union government to formulate a national policy regarding GM crops.
This policy should involve consultations with various stakeholders, including
experts, farmers,
state governments.
Case referred to larger bench:
The case will be referred to a larger bench for further adjudication due to the differing opinions. The Supreme Court directed that
the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)
should conduct a national consultation within four months to develop this policy.
Concerns Raised:
Justice Nagarathna pointed out that the GEAC did not consider the long-term effects of GM mustard on health and the environment, while Justice Karol noted the importance of conducting field trials under strict safeguards to monitor the crop’s impact.
Conclusion:
The Union government should formulate a detailed and inclusive national policy on genetically modified crops. This policy should be based on extensive consultations with experts, farmer representatives, state governments, and other stakeholders to ensure a balanced approach that considers scientific, environmental, and public health perspectives.

**********Is immunity for the President and Governors absolute?  
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Comparision between President and Governor
Mains level:
Immunity Under Article 361
Why in the news?
The Supreme Court has agreed to examine if the immunity granted to the President and Governors under Article 361 violates fundamental rights and constitutional principles.
What is the case?
The Supreme Court is examining a petition filed by a contractual woman employee of the West Bengal Raj Bhavan, who has accused
Governor C.V. Ananda Bose
of sexual harassment and molestation.
The petitioner argues that the
“absolute immunity”
granted to the Governor under Article 361 of the Constitution
undermines her fundamental rights
the fairness of the legal process.
Immunity Under Article 361:
provides immunity to the President and Governors from being answerable to any court for acts performed in their official capacity.
Specifically,
clause (2) of Article 361
states that
no criminal proceedings
can be initiated or continued
against the President or a Governor
during their
term of office
. The petitioner contends that this immunity should not apply to illegal acts that violate fundamental rights.
The petitioner argues that the Governor’s immunity caused negligent handling of her complaint by police,
delaying justice
hindering investigations
Supreme Court will determine
if Article 361(2) immunity is
absolute or can be challenged
in serious cases like
sexual harassment.
Does Article 361 Grant Absolution to the Governor against Criminal Charges?
Scope of Article 361:
Article 361 does grant significant immunity to Governors, shielding them from criminal proceedings during their term. However, the immunity is not absolute.
The first provision allows for the conduct of the President to be reviewed by designated bodies for impeachment, while the second provision allows for civil suits against the government.
Judicial Precedents:
Previous court rulings have indicated that while Governors enjoy immunity under Article 361, this does not prevent judicial scrutiny of their actions, especially if those actions infringe upon fundamental rights.
For example,
in the case of
Rameshwar Prasad vs. Union of India,
the Supreme Court stated that civil immunity does not preclude challenges based on malafide actions.
Potential for Legal Challenge:
The current case may set a precedent for how Article 361 is interpreted regarding criminal acts committed by Governors.
If the court finds that immunity does not apply to acts that
, it could pave the way for accountability and legal recourse for victims of misconduct by constitutional authorities.
Conclusion:

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
About PMJAY
Mains level:
Challenges to the Inclusivity of PMJAY
Why in the news?
With the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic behind us (though the World Health Organization warns the virus still lingers), the Union Budget shifted focus to economic growth levers like infrastructure and employment.
It was also hoped that recognizing population health as crucial for economic growth would lead to continued investment in strengthening health systems.
budget estimate
refers to the i
nitial allocation of funds
designated for various
programs, departments,
projects within a fiscal year.
It represents the government’s expectations regarding how much money will be required to meet planned expenditures.
In contrast,
revised estimates
come into play
later
. After assessing the
actual expenditures
needs after the first six months,
the government may adjust the initial budget estimates based on how much of the allocated funds have been utilised and what additional resources may be necessary.
Comparisons with Previous Years
Budgetary Estimates:
The comparison of the Budget Estimates (BE) for health between 2023-24 and 2025-25, reveals minimal increases:
Overall Health Ministry Budget: 1.98% increase
National Health Mission (NHM): 1.16% increase
PMJAY: 1.4% increase
Overall Health Ministry budget:
The present allocation made in the current Budget is deemed to be inadequate for expanding health coverage services and enhancing the impact of flagship health programs, particularly in light of rising
non-communicable diseases
and the
goal of universal health coverage
by 2030.
Misleading Comparisons:
When we compare the Budget estimates with the previous Revised estimates (RE) the budgetary increase of nearly
12%
is misleading, as the
RE reflects actual spending rather than the program’s needs.
Missed Opportunities
Health Workforce Development:
While the budget mentioned an increase in new medical colleges, it failed to address the critical need for a
multi-layered, multi-skilled health workforce.
Drug Pricing Mechanisms:
Although customs duties were waived on three anti-cancer drugs. However, the
budget missed
the chance to
implement price controls
pooled procurement strategies
that could have lowered drug costs across both public and private healthcare sectors. Establishing such mechanisms could enhance the affordability and accessibility of essential medications.
Climate-Resilient Agriculture:
While the budget committed to
climate-resilient agriculture,
which is crucial for food security, it
did not sufficiently link these efforts to health outcomes
, such as
nutrition
public health
, which are critical in the context of rising health challenges.
Limited Coverage of Middle Class:
PMJAY primarily targets the bottom 40% of the population based on economic status,
leaving the middle class without coverage
Focus on Secondary and Tertiary Care:
The program emphasizes
secondary and tertiary healthcare,
often neglecting primary care services. This approach limits comprehensive health coverage and fails to address preventive healthcare needs, which are crucial for achieving UHC.
Awareness and Accessibility Issues:
There is a significant disparity in awareness and accessibility of PMJAY across states.
For example,
awareness is notably higher in
Tamil Nadu (80%)
compared to
Bihar (20%).
Way forward:
Targeted Funding for Flagship Programs
: Need to allocate a more substantial increase in the budget for the National Health Mission (NHM) and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) to the eradication of non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis elimination by 2025.
Strengthen Primary Healthcare
: Govt. should ensure adequate funding for primary healthcare services, which form the foundation for preventive and community health initiatives.
Mains PYQ:
The public health system has limitations in providing universal health coverage. Do you think that the private sector can help in bridging the gap? What other viable alternatives do you suggest?

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
TB, CRISPR Cas-based TB Detection Kit
Why in the News?
The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Regional Medical Research Centre for North East has developed the “world’s cheapest CRISPR Cas-based TB testing system”.
Back2Basics: CRISPR-Cas9 Technology
CRISPR-Cas9 stands for
lustered
egularly
nterspaced
hort
alindromic
epeats and CRISPR-associated
protein 9
It is a technology that allows geneticists and researchers to
edit parts of the genome by altering sections of the DNA sequence.
Emmanuelle Charpentier
Jennifer Doudna
’s work on CRISPR-Cas9 as a ‘
molecular scissor’
earned them the
2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry
The system consists of two key components:
: This is the enzyme that acts like a pair of
molecular scissors
. It is responsible for cutting the DNA strand at a specific location, allowing for the removal, addition, or alteration of DNA at that site.
Guide RNA (gRNA)
: This is a piece of RNA that is designed to find and bind to a specific sequence of DNA that matches its code. The gRNA guides the Cas9 enzyme to the exact spot in the genome where an edit is desired.
Mechanism
The process begins with the design of a gRNA that matches the DNA sequence where an edit is needed.
Once inside the cell, the Cas9 enzyme and the gRNA form a complex that can identify and bind to the target DNA sequence.
The Cas9 then cuts the DNA at this location.
After the DNA is cut, the cell’s natural repair mechanisms can be harnessed to add or remove genetic material, or to make specific changes to the DNA.
Applications
: Used for gene editing to correct genetic disorders, develop targeted cancer therapies, enhance diagnostics for infectious diseases, and create personalized medicine approaches.
About the
New TB Detection System
The system can
detect TB bacteria using DNA
from a
patient’s saliva
at a very low cost.
Specific
DNA sequences unique to Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (the bacteria causing TB) are identified.
It can
identify the bacteria in preliminary stages
and test over 1,500 samples simultaneously within approximately two hours.
The technology is simple enough
to be used in primary health centres
in villages.
TB Situation in India:
kills
an estimated
480,000 Indians
annually
, or over
1,400 patients every day
India has more than
million ‘missing’ TB cases each year
, which remain undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed and treated in the private sector.
National Goals for Elimination of TB:
Pradhan Mantri TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyan (2022):
It is stipulated to meet the goal of ending the TB epidemic by 2025 from the country, five years ahead of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2030.
Nikshay Poshan Yojana (2018):
Launched in 2018, this scheme provides nutritional support to TB patients. Under this scheme, TB patients receive a direct benefit transfer (DBT) of Rs. 500 per month to purchase food.
