AFTER ELECTORAL BOND BAN, FUNDING THROUGH TRUST ROUTE UP
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
Context:
After the Supreme Court’s decision to scrap electoral bonds last year, donations to political parties significantly increased through electoral trusts, as indicated by the electoral trust contribution reports released by the Election Commission of India (ECI) for the previous financial year.
Background: –
Nearly three-fourths of the donations to the Prudent Electoral Trust, which has received the highest contribution, were made after the Supreme Court’s decision on February 15.
Key takeaways
An Electoral Trust is a non-profit organization established in India to facilitate transparent funding to political parties.
On 31st January, 2013, through ‘The Electoral Trusts Scheme, 2013’, the Central government specified the eligibility and procedure for registration of Electoral Trusts.
Key Features of Electoral Trusts
Purpose:
To collect voluntary contributions from individuals, companies, and institutions.
To distribute these funds to registered olitical parties.
Legal Framework:
Governed under Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 (as a non-profit).

ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN
Mains – GS 3
India’s Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is seen growing at a four-year low of 6.4 per cent in the current financial year 2024-25, the first advance estimates for FY25 released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) showed.
The government seems to have placed the blame for what it believes to be a cyclical slowdown largely at the door of the RBI. While the RBI’s tight monetary policy and interference with the rupee’s value have hindered export competitiveness, the issues are deeper and structural, not resolvable through interest rate cuts alone.
The high growth rates seen in the aftermath of the pandemic were driven in large part by the surge in services exports, specifically, the boom in Global Capability Centres (GCC).
However, this growth structure is biased in favour of the highly skilled who account for a very small section. With not many moving up the income ladder, the overall consumption base hasn’t been growing.
Limited upward mobility has, however, been a feature of the Indian economy, reflecting the inability to generate productive forms of employment for the majority. But mobility seems to have become more restricted since the pandemic. Arguably, the clearest evidence of this can be found in the car market, specifically, the low-priced, small car market.
Take the sub Rs 10 lakh segment. Cars in this segment are bought by first-time users or those upgrading from two-wheelers or used cars. In 2014-15, this category accounted for 73 per cent of all cars sold in the country. By 2024-25, the category accounted for just 46 per cent of all cars sold.
The labour market is just not providing enough productive employment opportunities nor are real wages growing at a fast clip.
While millions more have joined the workforce, more are now self-employed, either as unpaid help in household establishments or in one-man roadside shops or in agriculture. Informal establishments and employment continue to witness a expansion, indicating the absence of alternatives.
Formal employment, as per the EPFO payroll data shows, remains driven by expert services, which are nothing but manpower suppliers, normal contractors, and security services — segments that don’t require high-skill levels.
The fallout of limited job creation and muted wage growth can be seen in the greater recourse to debt. Household debt had risen to 43 per cent by June 2024. But even this debt surge has failed to boost overall consumption significantly.
With little demand visibility and uncertainty over government policy, investment activity continues to remain subdued. New project announcements have slowed down as per CMIE.

OLIVE RIDLEY TURTLES
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
Over the past two weeks, numerous dead olive ridley turtles have washed ashore in Tamil Nadu, particularly in Chennai.
Olive ridley turtles arrive near the Tamil Nadu coast around September-October to breed. Their nesting season begins in late November and ends in March. Although deaths during nesting season are not unusual, the large number of turtle carcasses found this early in the nesting period has sparked concerns.
<img alt="" class="wp-image-201401 aligncenter" decoding="async" height="360" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" src="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/t-300x261.png" srcset="https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/t-300x261.png 300w, https://iasbaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/t.png 602w" width="414"/>
Olive Ridley Sea Turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) are one of the smallest and most abundant of all sea turtles found globally.
Physical Characteristics:
Size: Around 60–70 cm in length and 35–50 kg in weight.
Shell: Olive-colored, heart-shaped, and flattened.
Habitat:
Found in warm waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans.
Prefer coastal and shallow marine environments but occasionally venture into open seas.
Diet: Omnivorous; feed on algae, fish, shrimp, crabs, and jellyfish.
Lifespan: Typically live for 50–60 years.
These turtles are known for their unique mass nesting events called “arribadas,” where thousands of females gather on the same beach to lay eggs. Significant nesting sites include the coasts of India, Mexico, and Costa Rica.
Olive ridley turtles lay eggs across several coastal states on India’s east coast and west coast. However, mass nesting takes place in Odisha, followed by Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
Odisha’s Gahirmatha and Rushikulya beaches witness the arrival of lakhs of female olive ridley turtles every year.
Olive Ridley turtles are classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List.

SVAMITVA SCHEME
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that once property cards under the Centre’s SVAMITVA scheme have been distributed in all the villages of the country, it could unlock economic activity worth over Rs 100 lakh crore.
The Prime Minister was addressing an event to distribute over 65 lakh property cards to property owners in over 50,000 villages through video conferencing.
The SVAMITVA stands for Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas. It aims to provide a ‘record of rights’ to those having houses in villages, and issue them a property card.
The scheme was launched by PM Modi on National Panchayati Raj Day, on April 24, 2020.
The plan is to survey all rural properties using drones and prepare GIS -based maps for each village.
Benefit of a SVAMITVA.
First, property cards enables rural households to use their property as a financial asset for taking loans and other financial benefits.
The cards help increase liquidity of land parcels in the market and increase the financial credit availability to the village.
Second, it helps in determination of property tax, which accrues to the Gram Panchayats directly in states where they are empowered to collect such taxes.
The scheme also paves the way for creation of accurate land records for rural planning. All the property records and maps are available at the Gram Panchayat level, which helps in taxation of villages, construction permits, elimination of encroachments, etc.

**********What are Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)?
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently issued new rules aimed at streamlining and tightening the settlement process for dues payable by borrowers to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs).
About Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):
An ARC is a specialized financial institution that
purchases the bad debts of a bank
at a mutually agreed value and
attempts to recover those debts or associated securities by itself.
help banks clean up their balance sheets
by acquiring financial assets from banks and financial institutions through auctions or bilateral negotiations.
ARCs are
registered under
regulated under the
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (
SARFAESI Act, 2002
They function
under the supervision and control of the RBI
As per the RBI, ARC

the functions namely
Acquisition of financial assets
, Change or
takeover of Management
Sale or Lease of Business of the Borrower,
Rescheduling of Debts,
Enforcement of Security Interest
Settlement of dues
payable by the borrower.
take over
a portion of the bank's debts, which qualify as
Non-Performing Assets (NPAs).
Therefore, ARCs are
involved in
the business of
asset reconstruction, securitisation, or both.
All the rights
previously
held by
the lender (the
bank)
in regard to the debt are
transferred to the ARC.
required
funds
to purchase such debts can be
raised from Qualified Buyers.
Qualified Buyers include Financial Institutions, Insurance companies, Banks, State Financial Corporations, State Industrial Development Corporations, trustee or ARCs registered under SARFAESI and Asset Management Companies registered under SEBI that invest on behalf of mutual funds, pension funds, FIIs, etc.
Qualified Buyers are the only persons from whom the ARC can raise funds.
ARCs are prohibited from raising money by way of deposit.
To commence the business of securitisation or asset reconstruction, an ARC
is required to have a minimum net owned fund (NOF) of Rs 300 crore
and thereafter, on an ongoing basis.
They are also mandated to maintain a capital adequacy ratio of a minimum of 15% of its total risk-weighted assets.
News Rules issued by the RBI:
The revised framework by the RBI mandates that ARCs adopt a more structured approach to settle dues while ensuring transparency and accountability in their operations.
As per the new guidelines, every
ARC must establish a Board-approved policy
that governs the settlement of borrower dues.
The policy is required to address critical aspects such as eligibility criteria for one-time settlements, permissible sacrifices based on exposure categories, and methodologies to determine the realisable value of securities.
For borrowers
with outstanding
dues exceeding Rs 1 crore
can only proceed after
thorough evaluation by an Independent Advisory Committee (IAC).
This committee has to comprise experts with technical, financial, or legal expertise, who will assess the borrower’s financial position, projected earnings, and recovery prospects before making recommendations to the ARC.
Further, the
Board of Directors
, including at least two independent directors,
must deliberate on the IAC’s recommendations
and evaluate alternative recovery options.
The Board’s decision, along with the rationale, must be meticulously documented in meeting minutes.
For dues of Rs 1 crore or below
can process settlements based on criteria defined in the Board-approved policy.
However, officials involved in acquiring the financial asset cannot participate in the approval of the settlement to prevent conflicts of interest.
Additionally, the Board must review quarterly reports detailing trends and recovery timelines for these accounts.
The revised framework emphasised on robust reporting requirements, including
periodic analysis of accounts settled through compromise
This analysis has to include details such as trends in settled accounts, categorisation of fraud and wilful default cases, and recovery timelines.
Settlements involving
borrowers classified as
wilful defaulters
or frauds will follow
same stringent procedures applicable to high-value accounts
, irrespective of the settlement amount.
ARCs are also required to ensure that settlements comply with existing laws and obtain consent decrees from judicial authorities when recovery proceedings are already underway.

**********What is Australopithecus?
Australopithecus had a variable but plant-based diet, according to an analysis of stable isotope data from seven hominin specimens dating back 3.5 million years from Sterkfontein in South Africa.
About Australopithecus:
Australopithecus, (genus Australopithecus) is a
group of extinct primates
known from a series of fossils found at numerous sites in eastern, north-central, and southern Africa.
They are the
closest known relatives of our genus, Homo
The various species of Australopithecus lived
4 million to 1.4 million years ago
(mya), during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs (which lasted from 5.3 million to 11,700 years ago).
The genus name,
meaning “southern ape
,”
refers to the first fossils found
, which were discovered
in South Africa.
Perhaps the
most famous specimen
is “Lucy,”
a remarkably preserved fossilized
skeleton from Ethiopia
that has been dated to 3.2 mya.
Features
As characterized by the fossil evidence, members of Australopithecus bore a
combination of humanlike and apelike traits.
Members of this species had
apelike face proportions
(a flat nose, a strongly projecting lower jaw) and
braincase
(with a
small brain
, usually less than 500 cubic centimeters - about 1/3 the size of a modern human brain), and long,
strong arms with curved fingers

**********Kalaripayattu
Kerala’s martial art form Kalaripayattu has become a bone of contention ahead of the 38th edition of the National Games which is scheduled to commence from January 28 in Uttarakhand.
About
Kalaripayattu:
It is one of the oldest and
most scientific martial art forms
in the world, aimed at mind and body coordination.
It originated and is widely practiced in Kerala. The term “Kalari” in Malayalam refers to a
traditional gymnasium
where this martial art,
known as Payattu,
is taught.
According to mythology, the warrior sage Parasurama is credited with establishing Kalarippayattu.
four stages of Kalaripayattu are:
Maippayattu:
It is the body conditioning phase where the person is
schooled to prepare
their
body for a fight
. Only after qualifying this stage can the practitioner proceed to the next phase of training.
Kolthari:
In this stage, a person is
taught attack and self-defense
with the help of wooden weapons such as short sticks, and long sticks.
Angathari:
Once the person overcomes the fear of fighting with
wooden weapons, sharp metal objects
are introduced — in the third stage.
Verumkai:
This stage includes
research-based bare-hand fighting
. Students are taught body anatomy so that they know what points they can hit and what they cannot.
The main ethnic styles of Kalarippayattu found in the three regions of northern Kerala (Malabar) are:
Vattenthirippu Style, Arappukkai Style and Pillathangi Style
It is believed that Kalarippayattu was introduced to
China at the Shaolin Temple
in the 5th century AD by Bodhidharma, who was originally from Thanjavore, a cultural center that was part of Kerala but is now in Tamil Nadu.

**********Midges
Researchers from the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) have identified 23 species of blood-sucking flies (Midges), 13 of them recorded for the first time in the country, in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
About
Midges:
These are
tiny insects
which are similar in appearance to flies but are more closely related to
mosquitoes
in their feeding habits.
They belong to the
Culicoides genus
and are locally called
bhusi files.
Food habit:
These flies
feed on the blood of livestock
such as sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as wild animals like deer.
Amongst them five species are known to transmit the
bluetongue disease virus
which is a condition that can be fatal to livestock.
Bluetongue disease manifests through symptoms including blue discolouration of the tongue, fever, facial swelling, and excessive salivation.
It can potentially lead to death in affected animals and poses a significant threat to livestock farming and the agricultural economy.
The study, conducted in 2022 and 2023, revealed that 17 of the 23 species identified are known to bite humans, although no human disease transmission has been reported.
13 new species recorded
for India are C. barnetti, C. gouldi, C. flaviscutellaris, C. flavipunctatus, C. hui, C. histrio, C. guttifer, C. perornatus, C. okinawensis, C. quatei, C. obscurus, C. coronalis, and C. kusaiensis.
The Indian Culicoides fauna now includes 93 valid species, many of which are recognised as confirmed or potential vectors of important pathogens of animal health.
Key facts about Culicoides
Distribution:
It is a large genus of the family Ceratopogonidae with cosmopolitan distribution excluding
New Zealand and Antarctica
, includes species that are among the smallest haematophagous members of the order Diptera.
The midges of this family are gaining significant attention due to
their role as vectors of almost 60 viruses, 40 protozoans, and 24 filarial nematodes
, impacting not only livestock and
wildlife but also humans.

**********UGC Regulations vs State University Laws: A Constitutional Dispute
Why in the News?
There is an ongoing conflict between the
University Grants Commission (UGC)
and State governments regarding the appointment of Vice Chancellors (VCs) in State universities.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context, Core of the Dispute, Impact, Way Forward, etc.)
Background:
A contentious dispute has emerged between the University Grants Commission and various State governments regarding the appointment of Vice Chancellors (VCs) in State universities.
The core issue revolves around whether
UGC Regulations, 2018
, which mandate a UGC nominee in the VC search committee, can supersede State University Acts.
This has led to leadership vacuums in several universities, notably in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Punjab, impacting their governance and academic administration.
Core of the Dispute:
UGC’s Stance
Regulation 7.3 of the
mandates the inclusion of a UGC nominee in VC search committees.
The UGC asserts this is essential to maintain uniform academic standards across the nation.
State Government’s Argument
State University Acts, passed by State legislatures, have their own provisions for VC appointments.
States, like Tamil Nadu, argue that imposing UGC nominees erodes their autonomy in governing universities.
Legal Complexity
Conflicting judgments from the Supreme Court have further complicated the issue.
While some rulings uphold UGC regulations as mandatory, others deem them advisory for State universities unless explicitly adopted by the State.
Constitutional Questions at Play:
Federal Structure and Delegated Legislation
The Constitution’s
Article 254(1)
states that Central laws prevail over State laws in the Concurrent List, but this applies only to
plenary laws
, not delegated legislation like UGC regulations.
Judicial Interpretations
Landmark rulings like
Tika Ramji v. State of Uttar Pradesh (1956)
Indian Express Newspapers v. Union of India (1984)
clarify that subordinate legislation cannot override plenary laws.
Recent cases like
Annamalai University v. Secretary, Tourism (2009)
Kalyani Mathivanan v. K.V. Jeyaraj (2015)
offer conflicting interpretations, leaving ambiguity.
Impact of the Debate:
Administrative Paralysis
Leadership vacancies in universities delay critical decisions, including staff appointments and degree conferrals.
Erosion of State Autonomy
Imposing UGC norms without State consent undermines the federal structure and States’ legislative authority.
Academic Implications
Disruptions in governance hinder the universities' ability to achieve academic and research excellence.
Judicial Precedents on UGC Authority:
Supporting UGC Regulations
Cases like
Gambhirdan K. Gadhvi v. State of Gujarat (2022)
upheld UGC’s authority, emphasizing the uniformity of higher education standards.
Advisory Nature of UGC
The Supreme Court in
University of Delhi v. Raj Singh (1994)
ruled that UGC guidelines are advisory unless adopted by States.
Contradictory Judgments
Some rulings have erroneously equated subordinate legislation with plenary laws, further complicating the legal landscape.
What Needs to be Done?
Constitutional Clarity
A ruling by a
Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court
is essential to resolve ambiguities, particularly on the applicability of Article 254(1) to delegated legislation.
Revised UGC Approach
The UGC should limit its role to advisory and collaborative functions, respecting State autonomy.
Balanced Governance Framework
States and the Centre should work together to develop mechanisms that balance uniform academic standards with local governance needs.
Conclusion:
The dispute between UGC regulations and State University Acts reflects larger issues of Centre-State relations, federalism, and the scope of delegated legislation.
Resolving this impasse requires not only judicial clarity but also a cooperative approach to harmonize governance in India’s higher education system.
A balanced resolution will ensure robust university administration while preserving the federal spirit enshrined in the Constitution.

**********Prioritising IMEC is in America’s Best Interest
Context
The
United States-India relationship has evolved into a cornerstone of modern geopolitics,
underpinned by shared democratic values, economic interests, and regional security priorities.
Since the Clinton administration redirected bilateral ties in the 1990s,
this partnership has matured into a vital strategic alliance.
Today, as global dynamics undergo significant shifts,
this relationship gains prominence, offering substantial opportunities for collaborative growth
, exemplified by the ambitious
India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).
The Strategic Imperative of IMEC: A Transformative Vision
A Gateway to Economic Integration
offers a unique opportunity to create seamless trade routes
by integrating railways, shipping networks, and other transportation systems across the participating nations.
This
connectivity is expected to reduce transportation costs significantly,
enhance supply chain efficiency, and facilitate faster movement of goods and services.
By establishing direct links between major economic hubs,
the corridor could unlock untapped trade potential, particularly for inland regions
and underdeveloped markets within participating countries.
By decentralising trade routes and reducing overreliance on traditional chokepoints such as the Suez Canal,
IMEC could emerge as a cornerstone of a more stable global trading system.
A Strategic Alternative to China’s BRI
Unlike the state-controlled model of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
which has drawn criticism for creating debt dependency in participating nations,
IMEC aims to promote economic growth based on democratic principles, market-driven investments, and equitable partnerships.
approach appeals to nations seeking infrastructure development without compromising their sovereignty.
For India, the corridor’s success holds particular significance.
By reducing trade costs and enhancing maritime logistics, IMEC strengthens India’s ability to compete in the global economy.
It also positions India as a central player in a rules-based international economic order
, furthering its ambitions as a global power.
Energy and Technological Innovation
The corridor
envisions developing cross-border pipelines for hydrogen and electricity
, which could pave the way for a sustainable energy future.
These
efforts align with global initiatives to reduce carbon emissions
and transition to renewable energy sources.
By integrating energy infrastructure into the corridor,
IMEC not only supports economic development but also contributes to the global fight against climate change.
Additionally, the inclusion of digital communication infrastructure within IMEC reflects its forward-looking approach to technological advancement.
High-speed data networks, fibre-optic cables, and other digital assets integrated into the corridor could facilitate innovation
, enhance connectivity, and enable collaboration in emerging industries such as artificial intelligence, fintech, and cybersecurity.
Geopolitical Implications
developing closer ties between the United States, India, and other participating nations,
corridor has the potential to realign regional geopolitics.
For the Middle East, IMEC provides a framework for deeper integration with the West,
helping nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE diversify their economies and modernise their infrastructure.
For Europe, the corridor strengthens ties with South Asia,
creating opportunities for greater economic and technological collaboration.
A Vision for Shared Prosperity
Ultimately,
the strategic imperative of IMEC lies in its capacity to transform the global economic landscape.
By integrating economies across three continents, focusing on innovation, and addressing energy security,
the corridor serves as a beacon of collaborative progress.
Its potential to reduce trade barriers, promote sustainability,
and enhance regional stability
underscores its importance as a visionary project for the 21st century.
successful implementation of IMEC would not only reshape global trade dynamics but also reinforce the shared values of its participants
, offering a compelling alternative to unilateral approaches in an increasingly interconnected world.
Challenges and Collaborative Opportunities in IMEC’s Realisation
Investment and Financial Viability
Constructing the corridor’s physical and digital infrastructure
, comprising railways, shipping networks, pipelines, and data communication systems,
demands billions of dollars.
Governments must allocate resources for IMEC
while balancing domestic priorities such as healthcare, education, and existing infrastructure needs.
Private-sector participation is critical
to closing the investment gap.
However,
attracting corporate investors requires the development of clear financial frameworks,
incentives, and risk-sharing mechanisms.
Political Coordination and Willpower
Each nation has unique economic priorities, strategic goals
, and domestic challenges, which could lead to conflicting agendas.
For instance, countries in the Middle East, like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, may focus on diversifying their economies beyond oil,
while European nations might prioritise environmental sustainability and technological innovation.
India and the U.S. may emphasise strategic counterbalances to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
requiring alignment with the broader goals of other participants.
this challenge also creates a platform for unprecedented diplomatic engagement
Regular summits, multilateral negotiations, and mechanisms like working groups can provide a forum to reconcile differences and develop mutually beneficial strategies.
Infrastructure Development Complexities
Building efficient railways, maritime hubs
, and pipelines across multiple countries
demands meticulous planning and execution.
Disparate regulatory standards
, varying levels of existing infrastructure, and
bureaucratic red tape in different nations can create bottlenecks.
ensuring that all participating countries adhere to uniform construction
safety standards adds another layer of complexity.
opportunity here lies in creating collaboration among the world’s leading engineering firms,
technology providers, and infrastructure experts.
Balancing Sustainability and Economic Growth
IMEC’s vision of integrating green energy solutions
, such as hydrogen pipelines and renewable energy sources,
aligns with global sustainability goals.
balancing this environmental commitment with economic growth can be challenging,
particularly for nations heavily reliant on fossil fuels.
Transitioning to clean energy infrastructure requires significant investment
, technological innovation, and policy changes.
Countries like India, already a leader in green hydrogen, can play a pivotal role
in advancing sustainable practices within IMEC.
International partnerships with nations like Germany and Japan can further accelerate the adoption of renewable energy technologies
, reducing the environmental impact of the corridor.
The Importance of U.S. Leadership in the Realisation of IMEC
The United States’ leadership is
pivotal in steering IMEC towards success.
Under the Trump administration, diplomatic milestones like the Abraham Accords laid the groundwork for initiatives like IMEC
by fostering cooperation in the Middle East.
As the U.S. seeks to consolidate its strategic partnerships,
the corridor offers a platform to reinforce its alliances with India and other participants.
Moreover,
the rapport between Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could serve as a catalyst for strengthened collaboration
, particularly in convening stakeholders to define IMEC’s future trajectory.
Conclusion
The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor
symbolises a bold
reimagining of regional economic cooperation.
By creating integration across diverse nations, the project has the potential to reshape global trade,
bolster energy security, and drive technological innovation while addressing environmental challenges.
The United States and India
, as key architects,
bear the responsibility of shepherding IMEC to completion.

Editorial Analysis
**********UGC’s Draft Regulation Has Serious Constitutional Issues
Context
The
draft regulation proposed by the University Grants Commission (UGC)
concerning the selection and appointment of vice-chancellors
has become a contentious issue.
draft regulation raises concerns about federalism
, with critics arguing that the draft regulation
undermines the constitutional principles of State autonomy.
Therefore,
it is now imperative to examine the UGC’s proposal, the constitutional and legal challenges it raises
, and its implications for the governance of higher education in India.
Key Provisions of the Draft Regulation and the Mandate of the UGC
The proposed amendment to the UGC Regulation 2010
aims to widen the eligibility criteria for the appointment of vice-chancellors.
current regulation mandates that only academicians with at least 10 years of experience as professors
are eligible.
The draft proposes to include professionals with equivalent experience in industry, public administration, or public policy.
Proponents argue this broadens the talent pool, while detractors claim it deviates from the UGC’s primary mandate
and encroaches on the States’ jurisdiction over higher education.
The Mandate of the UGC
Established under the
University Grants Commission Act of 1956, the UGC was tasked with coordinating and maintaining standards in university
education across India.
Its
functions include advising governments, regulating fees, determining teaching standards
, and allocating funds.
However,
the Act does not explicitly authorise the UGC to regulate the selection or appointment of vice-chancellors.
Critics argue that this overreach
undermines the legislative autonomy of States
, which typically establish universities and prescribe the qualifications and appointment processes for their leadership.
Legal and Constitutional Challenges Faced by UGC’s Draft Regulation
The Scope of the UGC’s Mandate
The UGC Act, 1956, explicitly outlines the commission’s role
in maintaining and coordinating academic standards across universities.
Its functions,
as outlined in Section 26 of the Act, include prescribing qualifications for teaching staff, setting minimum academic standards
, and coordinating educational initiatives.
the Act does not confer the UGC with powers to regulate the administrative appointment of vice-chancellors
, whose responsibilities often extend beyond academic oversight to include administrative leadership and institutional governance.
Critics argue that the draft regulation overreaches
by venturing into a domain not expressly granted to the UGC by its parent Act.
Subordinate legislation,
such as UGC regulations, is valid only when it operates within the framework of the enabling statute.
principle of ultra vires
applies here,
if a regulation exceeds the authority granted by the statute, it is deemed invalid.
In this case, the UGC’s attempt to dictate the selection and qualifications of vice-chancellors could be challenged as being outside its statutory remit.
Judicial Interpretations and Precedents
Suresh Patilkhede vs The Chancellor, Univ. of Maharashtra (2011)
In this case, the Bombay High Court held
that the qualifications and methods of appointing vice-chancellors do not directly impact academic standards
and therefore
fall outside the UGC’s jurisdiction.
court emphasised that administrative appointments, including those of vice-chancellors, are primarily the prerogative of the respective university statutes
and State legislatures.
Kalyani Mathivanan vs K.V. Jeyaraj and Ors (2015)
The above
interpretation was partly overturned by the Supreme Court
in this case.
The apex court held that UGC regulations, being subordinate legislation under a Central Act, have binding authority over universities
, including those established under State laws.
This
ruling created a precedent for the enforceability of UGC regulations
, though it did not explicitly address whether the UGC could regulate areas beyond its statutory mandate.
The Supreme Court’s reasoning in Kalyani Mathivanan has been critiqued for its interpretation
of parliamentary procedures
regarding subordinate legislation.
The ‘Direct Impact’ Test
An
additional challenge lies in determining whether the UGC’s regulations on vice-chancellors meet the direct impact
test on academic standards.
Courts have repeatedly held that
regulations must demonstrate a clear and direct connection to the UGC’s mandate of maintaining academic quality.
administrative and leadership qualities of vice-chancellors, while significant, may not directly affect teaching and research standards
in a manner that
justifies UGC intervention.
Implications on Federalism and the Principle of Repugnancy
The UGC draft regulation
also raises questions about its compatibility with the constitutional framework of federalism.
Education is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Indian Constitution,
meaning both the Union and the States can legislate on it.
the Constitution ensures that State legislatures retain significant autonomy in matters of higher education governance,
particularly concerning universities established under State statutes.
Article 254 of the Constitution
addresses situations
where a state law conflicts with a Central law.
If
such a conflict exists, the Central law prevails,
and the State law is void to the extent of the inconsistency.
this principle applies primarily to laws enacted by legislatures,
not to subordinate legislation like UGC regulations.
Consequently, a regulation made by the UGC cannot override a state statute
unless the State law is explicitly repugnant to a Central law.
Recommendations and the Way Forward
SC’s observation in the Kalyani Mathivanan case that Regulation 7.3.0 on vice-chancellors is recommendatory rather than mandatory
for State universities
offers a potential resolution to the current controversy.
Treating the UGC’s guidelines as advisory respects the autonomy of State legislatures
while providing a framework for maintaining educational standards.
To avoid future conflicts, the UGC should align its regulations with the constitutional distribution of powers
and focus on areas explicitly within its mandate.
collaborative approach involving consultation with State governments and other stakeholders can ensure that reforms in higher education
respect federal principles while achieving the goal of academic excellence.
Conclusion
The UGC’s draft regulation on the appointment of vice-chancellors touches upon critical issues of federalism, legislative competence
, and the role of regulatory bodies in higher education.
While the intention to broaden the selection criteria may be well-meaning,
the proposal raises constitutional and policy concerns that cannot be ignored.
Addressing these challenges requires a nuanced understanding of the UGC’s mandate, the constitutional framework, and the need for cooperative federalism in
the governance of education in India.

**********Understanding HMPV - A Well-Known but Recently Spotlighted Virus
Context:
As anxieties about respiratory disease outbreaks like HMPV are understandable in the wake of the Covid19 pandemic, science-based communication and response become even more critical for all sections of society.
Introduction - HMPV in Context:
Discovery and prevalence:
Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), first detected in
2001
, has been circulating in human populations for decades.
It is
well-known to the medical community
for its characteristics, prevention, and management.
Current situation in India:
Recent media attention has brought HMPV into focus, though detected cases remain within expected seasonal ranges and do not pose a significant threat.
Transmission and Symptoms of HMPV:
Spread mechanism:
HMPV spreads via droplets, infected surfaces, and physical contact such as handshakes.
Incubation and symptoms:
Symptoms appear within 3-6 days of infection
and include nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, breathlessness, fever, sore throat.
Severe cases, though rare, may affect infants, the elderly
, and immunocompromised individuals.
Prevention and Management of HMPV:
Precautionary measures:
Key flu-season precautions:
Wearing masks.
Hand hygiene and avoiding face-touching.
Avoiding crowded areas, especially for vulnerable groups.
Treatment:
Symptomatic management includes:
Hydration, rest, warm fluids, paracetamol for fever.
Monitoring for severe symptoms like difficulty breathing or incessant coughing in high-risk groups.
India’s Preparedness and Surveillance to Deal with HMPV:
Health infrastructure:
The Indian healthcare system is equipped to manage HMPV using
RT-PCR
(Real-Time Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain)
tests
, though testing is generally unnecessary for mild cases.
Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) role:
Surveillance reveals HMPV caused approximately 3% of Influenza-Like Illness (
ILI
) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (
SARI
) cases this season.
Virus trends:
Seasonal trends in virus circulation are monitored; there is no evidence of mutations in HMPV.
Key Comparisons - HMPV vs. SARS-CoV-2:
Differences:
HMPV, unlike the novel SARS-CoV-2 (first detected in 2019), is well-studied with decades of global exposure.
HMPV (
Pneumoviridae family
) and SARS-CoV-2 (
Coronaviridae family
) belong to two very different virus families with fundamentally different characteristics and epidemiology.
Unlike SARS-CoV-2,
strong seasonality is seen for HMPV.
Severity:
HMPV generally causes milder illness with minimal long-term effects, unlike SARS-CoV-2.
Lessons from the Pandemic:
Government action:
Proactive surveillance by the Ministry of Health, ICMR, and National Centre for Disease Control (
NCDC
) builds confidence in handling outbreaks.
Preparedness goals:
Recommendations from NITI Aayog’s 2024 report stress pandemic readiness through
investments in R&D for vaccines and strengthening emergency response mechanisms
, which have been identified by the WHO.
This will help India to be fully prepared for future outbreaks, epidemics from known and emerging infections.
Environmental considerations:
Air pollution exacerbates respiratory illnesses like ILI and SARI, highlighting the urgency for a national, multi-sectoral response.
Conclusion - Stay Alert, Not Alarmed:
HMPV cases in India are no cause for panic, given the virus’s well-understood nature and manageable impact.
Proactive communication, robust surveillance, and addressing environmental drivers
like air pollution remain critical for public health.

**********Trump 2.0 and Challenges for India
Why in news?
President Donald Trump, in his inaugural speech for a second term, announced a "revolution of common sense" to shift America away from "liberal extremism" and "declinist pessimism."
Criticizing the "corrupt establishment" for domestic and international crises, he promised bold changes in immigration, trade, free speech, identity politics, and environmental mandates.
Trump reaffirmed support for
taxing imports to boost domestic manufacturing
and introduced plans for an External Revenue Service to handle taxes on imports, complementing the Internal Revenue Service.
What’s in today’s article?
India-US relations – Current status
India-US Relations Under Trump 1.0
Trump’s Vision for a Thrilling New Era
General nature of India-US relations
Historical Context of India-US Relations
India-US relations have evolved over decades, overcoming challenges and building partnerships:
Prime Minister Vajpayee: Called the nations “natural allies,” emphasizing shared values and geopolitical interests.
President Obama: Defined the partnership as “a defining relationship of the 21st century.”
Prime Minister Modi: Asserted in 2016 that the partnership had overcome historical hesitations to form a long-term alliance.
Economic and Trade Cooperation
Trade Relations: The US is India’s largest market for goods and services.
FDI: US foreign direct investment in India was $51.6 billion in 2022.

Technological and Strategic Collaboration
India and the US cooperate in critical areas of technology and innovation, including:
Advanced Technologies
: Blockchain, clean energy, cyber sciences, and space exploration.
Health and Agriculture
: Collaboration on health security and agricultural advancements.
Strategic Trade Authorization
: India’s elevation to Tier 1 status in 2018 allowed it licence-free access to regulated US technologies.
During Donald Trump’s first term, India and US enjoyed a strong relationship marked by personal rapport between PM Narendra Modi and President Trump.
Key highlights include:
Reviving the Quad initiative.
Renaming the US Pacific Command to the US Indo-Pacific Command.
Recognizing India’s emergence as a global power and strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific region.
President Donald Trump, in his second inaugural address, unveiled a bold agenda to transform America’s domestic and foreign policies.
He emphasized reversing liberal policies and advancing an “America First” agenda to restore national sovereignty, renew traditional values, and bolster economic and military strength.
Economic Revival and Energy Independence
Trump vowed to rebuild the U.S. economy by reducing inflation and removing environmental constraints on growth.
He plans to expand energy production, including drilling for oil, and gut climate controls, aligning with the priorities of his election supporters.
Foreign Policy: Assertive and Transactional
Rejecting isolationism, Trump promised to prioritize defending U.S. borders over distant conflicts while taking a “peacemaker” stance abroad.
His policies aim to reclaim global primacy with a focus on strategic interests, including assertive claims on the
Panama Canal and renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.
India, which has shared strong ties with the U.S. in recent decades, must prepare for a
transactional relationship
under Trump.
Trade, immigration, and internal reforms in India will play a critical role in navigating this new dynamic.
Indian Markets Brace for Trump’s Presidency
As Donald Trump assumes office as the 47th President of the United States, Indian markets are taking a cautious stance.
While Trump’s election in November spurred a Sensex rally of over 900 points, market participants are now adopting a “wait and watch” approach, given uncertainty around his policy announcements.

**********RG Kar Rape Case: Not A Rarest Of Rare Case
Why in news?
Sanjoy Roy, convicted of raping and murdering a doctor at RG Kar Medical College in Kolkata, was sentenced to life imprisonment by a sessions court.
Despite the CBI's push for the death penalty and public outcry, the court upheld the Supreme Court's principle of reserving the death penalty for the "rarest of rare" cases, considering both aggravating and mitigating circumstances as outlined in the
Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980) judgment
What’s in today’s article?
Death Penalty - Rarest of rare test
Death Penalty - Aggravating Circumstances
Death Penalty - Mitigating Circumstances
Evolving Understanding of Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances Post-Bachan Singh
Stage of Trial: When Should Mitigating and Aggravating Circumstances Be Considered?
In the 1980 Bachan Singh case, the Supreme Court upheld the death penalty but restricted its imposition to the “rarest of rare” cases, where no possibility of reform exists.
While it did not provide exact standards, the court outlined lists of
circumstances to guide decisions.
Premeditated and Brutal Acts
: Murder that is pre-planned, calculated, and involves extreme brutality.
Exceptional Depravity
: Acts showing extraordinary cruelty.
Targeting Public Servants
: Killing public servants, police officers, or armed forces personnel on duty or due to lawful actions.
Mental or Emotional Disturbance
: Offender acting under extreme mental or emotional stress.
Age of the Accused
: If the offender is very young or very old.
Threat to Society
: Low likelihood of the offender being a continuing danger.
Possibility of Reform
: Potential for the offender’s rehabilitation.
Acting Under Influence
: Offender was acting on someone else’s directions or had moral justification.
Mental Impairment
: Offender’s inability to understand the criminality of their actions due to mental illness.
Over time, courts have added new dimensions to aggravating and mitigating factors, refining the application of the “rarest of rare” doctrine.
Young Age as a Mitigating Factor
Cases like Ramnaresh and Ors v. State of Chhattisgarh (2012) and Ramesh v. State of Rajasthan (2011) highlighted that young age (below 30) could indicate reform potential.
Inconsistent Application:
The Law Commission’s 262nd Report (2015) noted inconsistent consideration of age.
In Shankar Kisanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra (2013), the SC categorized similar cases into groups where age was either emphasized or ignored.
RG Kar Case
: The convict, Sanjoy Roy, is 35 years old, which may weigh against age as a mitigating factor.
Nature of the Offence
Need for Comparison:
Shankar Khade case emphasized comparing the case to similar offences to prevent subjective application of the “rarest of rare” doctrine.
Shock to Collective Conscience:
In Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab (1983), the SC held that the death penalty could be imposed if the crime shocks society's collective conscience.
However, this approach focuses on the crime’s circumstances, often ignoring the offender’s reform potential.
Bachan Singh Principle
The SC established that the government must prove there is no possibility of reform, with a presumption against the death penalty.
Objectivity in Sentencing
In Santosh Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra (2009), the SC underscored the need for clear evidence to demonstrate that the convict is beyond reform, ensuring objectivity in sentencing decisions.
Law Commission’s Observation
The 2015 report stressed the importance of evidence to support the claim that reformation is impossible.
Key Observations
The evolution of mitigating and aggravating factors has exposed inconsistencies, especially regarding age and the subjective interpretation of “rarest of rare” cases.
Courts are encouraged to balance the crime's nature, the offender's circumstances, and the potential for reform to ensure a just sentencing process.
Separate Sentencing Trial
In Bachan Singh, the SC mandated a separate trial after conviction to allow judges to hear arguments on why the death penalty should not be imposed.
Timing
: The SC has varied in its rulings:
It can take place on the same day (several rulings).
It requires a “real, effective, and meaningful hearing” (Dattaraya v. State of Maharashtra, 2020).
Issues with Same-Day Sentencing
Lack of Meaningful Hearing
In Dattaraya case, the absence of a proper sentencing hearing was deemed a valid reason to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment.
Suo Motu Proceedings (2022)
The SC questioned whether same-day sentencing meets the standard of meaningful and effective hearings and referred the matter to a larger Bench for creating uniform guidelines.
Disadvantage to the Convict
Aggravating vs. Mitigating Circumstances
Aggravating factors are part of the case record and readily available to judges.
Mitigating factors are presented only after conviction, creating an imbalance against the convict.
Judicial Concern
The SC highlighted this imbalance, emphasizing the need for a fairer approach to sentencing.
Need for Uniform Guidelines
The SC acknowledged inconsistencies in sentencing hearings and referred the matter to a larger Bench to establish a uniform process for considering mitigating circumstances in death penalty cases.
