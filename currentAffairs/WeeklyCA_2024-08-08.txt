Source: BS
Why in News?
Parliament is set to introduce the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, to amend the
Waqf Act, 1995
, with the
goal of enhancing accountability and transparency
in the functioning of Waqf boards.
It seeks to remove certain provisions of the Waqf act, 1995 to reduce the Waqf Boards' unchecked power, which currently lets them declare any property as Waqf without necessary checks.
What are the Key Amendments in Waqf Act (Amendment Bill), 2024?
Transparency:
The Bill outlines around 40 amendments to the current Waqf Act, including that Waqf Boards
will be required to undergo mandatory verification for all property claims,
ensuring transparency
Gender Diversity:
Sections 9 and 14 of the Waqf Act, 1995 will be amended to modify the
composition
and functioning of the
Waqf Board,
including the addition of
women representatives.
Revised Verification Procedures:
New verification procedures will be introduced for Waqf properties to address disputes and prevent misuse, with
district magistrates
potentially
overseeing
these properties.
Limited Power:
The amendments respond to concerns about the Waqf Boards’ unchecked powers, which have led to
extensive land
being claimed as
Waqf,
causing disputes and misuse claims.
For example, in September 2022, the
Tamil Nadu Waqf Board
claimed the entire
Thiruchendurai village,
which is predominantly Hindu.
Why Amendment to the Waqf Act, 1995 have been Criticised?
Reduced Powers:
limits
authority
of Waqf Boards, affecting their ability to manage Waqf properties.
Minority Rights Concerns:
Critics worry it might
harm
the interests of
Muslim communities
that use these properties for religious and charitable purposes.
Increased Government Control:
The involvement of district magistrates and more oversight could lead to excessive
bureaucratic interference.
Hampers Freedom of Religion:
The involvement of district magistrates and other government officials in overseeing Waqf properties may be viewed as an encroachment on
religious autonomy.
Potential Disputes:
New verification processes like involvement of district magistrates might create more
complications.
What is Waqf Act, 1955?
Background:
The Waqf act was first passed by Parliament in
1954.
It was later repealed, and a new
was passed in
1995,
which gave more powers to Waqf Boards.
2013,
the Act was further amended to grant the Waqf Board
extensive powers
to designate property as
'Waqf Property.'
Waqf:
It is the permanent dedication of
movable
immovable properties for religious, pious or charitable
purposes as recognised by Muslim law.
It implies the
endowment of property,
whether immovable or immovable, tangible or intangible, to God by a Muslim, under the premise that the
transfer
will benefit the
needy.
proceeds
from a Waqf typically fund
educational institutions,
graveyards, mosques
shelter homes.
Waqfs in India are
regulated
by the
Waqf act, 1995.
Management of Waqf:
survey commissioner
lists all properties declared as Waqf by conducting
local investigations,
summoning witnesses, and requisitioning public documents.
The Waqf is managed by a
mutawali,
who acts as a
supervisor.
Unlike trusts established under the
Indian Trusts Act, 1882
, which can serve broader purposes and be dissolved by the board, Waqfs are specifically for
charitable uses
and are intended to be
perpetual.
Waqfs can be either
public,
serving charitable ends, or
private,
benefiting the property owner’s
direct descendants.
To create a Waqf, one must be of
sound mind
and hold
valid ownership
of the property. Interestingly, the creator of a Waqf, known as the Waqif, does not have to be a Muslim, as long as they profess belief in Islamic principles.
Waqf Board:
A Waqf board is a
legal entity
capable of
acquiring, holding
transferring
property. It
can sue and be sued in court.
administers
Waqf properties,
recovers
lost properties and
sanctions
the transfer of immovable Waqf properties through sale, gift, mortgage, exchange, or lease, with at least two-thirds of the board members voting in favour of the transaction.
Central Waqf Council (CWC),
established in
1964,
oversees and advises state level Waqf Boards across India.
Waqf Properties:
The Waqf board is said to be
the third-largest landholder
in India after the Railways and the Defence department.
Currently, there are 8,72,292 registered Waqf properties spread across 8 lakh acres. These properties generate Rs 200 crore in revenue.
Once a property is
designated
it becomes
non-transferable
and is
detained perpetually
as a charitable act toward God, essentially transferring ownership to God.
Conclusion
The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 enhances the management and transparency of waqf properties in India. By improving governance, accountability, and asset utilisation, it empowers waqf boards to ensure benefits reach intended communities. This amendment aims to preserve waqf integrity while promoting social welfare and economic development, potentially fostering greater trust and community engagement.
