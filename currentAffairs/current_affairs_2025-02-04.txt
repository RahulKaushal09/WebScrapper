MAKHANA
Syllabus:
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
Context:
Union Finance Minister, while presenting the Union Budget, said that a “Makhana Board” will be set up in Bihar to boost the cultivation and marketing of fox nuts.
Background: –
Bihar accounts for approximately 90% of India’s makhana production. This production is primarily concentrated in northern and eastern Bihar.
Key takeaways
Makhana (fox nut), is the dried edible seed of the prickly water lily or gorgon plant (Euryale ferox). This plant is found in freshwater ponds throughout South and East Asia. It is recognized for its violet and white flowers, as well as its large, round, and prickly leaves, which can often exceed a meter in diameter.
The edible part of the Makhana plant consists of small, round seeds that have an outer layer ranging from black to brown. This has led to it being referred to as the ‘Black Diamond.’
After processing, these seeds are often consumed as popped snacks known as ‘lava.’ Makhana is highly nutritious and provides an excellent source of carbohydrates, protein, and minerals. Due to its versatile applications in medicine, healthcare, and nutrition, this plant can be consumed in various forms.
In 2022, ‘Mithila Makhana’ was conferred a Geographical Indication tag.
In addition to Bihar, makhana is cultivated in smaller quantities in the states of Assam, Manipur, West Bengal, Tripura, and Odisha, as well as in neighboring countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, China, Japan, and Korea.
Climatic Conditions for Cultivation
Makhana (Gorgon Nut or Foxnut) is an aquatic crop and is mainly grown in tropical and subtropical regions.  It is traditionally cultivated in stagnant water bodies such as ponds, land depressions, lakes, ditches, or wetlands with shallow water depths of up to 4-6 feet.
For optimal growth and development, Makhana requires a temperature range of 20-35°C, relative humidity of 50-90%, and annual rainfall between 100-250 cm.

DOMESTIC WORKERS
Domestic workers and those who work towards the well-being of this vulnerable segment of the workforce have found hope with the Supreme Court’s recent direction to the Union government to look into a law to regulate the sector.
SC ordered the government to form an inter-ministerial committee to consider the desirability of recommending a legal framework for the benefit, protection and regulation of the rights of domestic workers.
India is yet to ratify the ILO Convention 189 on domestic workers.
The court noted that the poor conditions of domestic workers are largely due to the lack of appropriate regulations. The court highlighted the exclusion of these workers from many labour legislation, including the Minimum Wages Act and the Equal Remuneration Act.
While acknowledging existing state-specific regulations, SC noted the importance of having national-level legislation that is binding on all states.
Domestic work is a feminised occupation, with migrants from marginalised communities constituting a considerable proportion.
Low wages, unfair working conditions, the obligation to attend to additional tasks, increased workload without additional compensation are the key features that mark the sector.  Job insecurity and complete absence of social security measures force the workers to accept vulnerable conditions of work.
Why domestic workers needs separate legislation
The Code on Wages (2019), unlike the Minimum Wages Act, by definition covers the sector. But the intricacies, complexities and hierarchies of the occupation which intersects with gender, caste, and class makes the sector distinct.
The different systems of employment of workers — part-time/full-time, live in/live out — have contributed to the complexity of the sector.
The asymmetric relationship between employer and employee, where the workplace is the former’s private space and the latter’s workplace is an issue that makes the sector qualitatively different.
Further, the work undertaken — mundane cleaning tasks and cooking or care work — are all socially devalued.
Challenges and way forward
The definition of what constitutes domestic work needs to be carefully worked out.
One of the prerequisites for enforcement of any labour regulation is proof of employment. Most employers do not view themselves as “employers” or their homes as “workplaces”.
The recent attempts in the direction of the states of Kerala and Delhi could be looked at for learning.

ELS COTTON
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
Union Finance Minister, while presenting the Union Budget, announced a five-year mission to “facilitate significant improvements in productivity and sustainability of cotton farming, and promote extra-long staple (ELS) cotton varieties”.
Currently, India’s per acre yields are significantly lower than others. Brazil boasts an average yield of 20 quintals per acre, while China boasts a yield of 15 quintals.
Better seeds, timely agronomic advice, and adoption of technology would help India improve in this regard, and grow premium varieties such as ELS cotton.
What is Extra-long Staple cotton?
Cotton is classified, based on the length of its fibres, as long, medium, or short staple.
Gossypium hirsutum, which constitutes roughly 96% of the cotton grown in India, falls in the medium staple category, with fibre lengths ranging from 25 to 28.6 mm.
On the other hand, ELS varieties boast fibre lengths of 30 mm and above. Most ELS cotton comes from the species Gossypium barbadense, commonly known as Egyptian or Pima cotton. ELS cotton today is mainly grown in China, Egypt, Australia, and Peru.
In India, some ELS cotton is grown along rain fed parts of Maharashtra and around Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu.
Fabric produced using ELS cotton is of the highest quality. Brands producing top-of-the-line fabrics mix a small quantity of ELS with medium staple cotton to improve quality.
Why is ELS cotton not grown in India?
For the 2024-25 season, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of medium staple cotton was Rs 7,121 (per quintal) while that of long staple cotton was Rs 7,521.
Nonetheless, farmers in India have thus far been reluctant to adopt ELS cotton. This is mainly due to lower than average per acre yields. While the medium staple variety yields between 10 and 12 quintals per acre, ELS cotton has a yield of only 7-8 quintals.
Additionally, farmers growing ELS cotton are often unable to market their premium produce at premium prices.

2024 YR4
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
A newly discovered asteroid — called 2024 YR4 — has slightly more than 1% chance of crashing into Earth in 2032, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said.
2024 YR4 is big but not as big as the asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs and most other extant life some 66 million years ago.  The 2024 YR4, however, can cause considerable localised damage in case it hits a populated area.
The 2024 YR4 was first discovered in December last year by a telescope in Chile. The near-Earth asteroid is as big as a football field. It came closest to Earth on Christmas Day — passing within roughly 800,000 kilometres of Earth.
It will eventually fade from view over the next few months, and will not be visible again until it passes Earth’s way again in 2028. Scientists are currently using some of the most powerful telescopes to determine 2024 YR4’s path and size before it gets out of sight.
To check how large an asteroid is, astronomers examine the brightness of the object — brighter objects are bigger. However, it is difficult to tell the exact measurements as the brightness depends on how reflective the asteroid’s surface is (asteroids do not emit a light of their own, they only reflect sunlight).
How much destruction could the 2024 YR4 cause?
Astronomers use the Torino Scale to categorise an object’s destruction potential. 2024 YR4 is currently rated 3 on a scale from 0 to 10.
The 2024 YR4 is expected to release 8 to 10 megatons of energy in case of a crash. The asteroid that hit Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013, released energy equivalent to about 500 kilotons of TNT — about 30 times more than the Hiroshima atomic bomb. That asteroid was around half the size of 2024 YR4.
How often do asteroids crash into Earth?
Thousands of asteroids enter the Earth’s atmosphere every day. Most are very small and burn up in the atmosphere due to friction.
Large asteroids, which can cause global disasters, hit Earth much less often. Those bigger than a kilometre in diameter, such as the Chicxulub asteroid that sent the dinosaurs into extinction might hit in 260 million years.
Smaller asteroids can also cause damage, like the one did in Chelyabinsk. It all depends on the asteroid’s speed and angle of entry into Earth’s atmosphere.
Space agencies are working on planetary defence mechanisms that can prevent celestial bodies from colliding with Earth. For instance, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), a joint project between NASA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, was the first planetary defence mission of NASA.

Ambergris is one of the nature’s most bizarre occurrences which originates from sperm whales, indirectly promotes the exploitation of these marine mammals.
About Ambergris:
It is a waxy substance often called as
whale vomit
which is produced by
sperm whales.
How it is formed?
Scientists believe that ambergris is formed in the
intestines of sperm whales
The substance is created when the
whale consumes indigestible materials,
such as squid beaks, and forms ambergris to help expel these foreign objects.
Once expelled, the ambergris floats in the ocean.
Appearance:
soft and has a waxy, greasy
Over time, as it floats in the ocean and is exposed to sunlight, saltwater, and air, it hardens and develops a rock-like appearance.
The outer layers become crusty and rough, resembling a stone, while the inside may retain a softer, waxier texture.
Its rarity and desirability make ambergris
one of the most expensive substances in the world.
It is highly sought after in the
perfume industry,
helps make fragrances last longer
There is a
ban on the possession and trade
of ambergris in countries like the

**********India's Ethanol Blending Targets
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
About Ethanol Production (Sources, Role of Maize, Govt Initiatives, Challenges, etc.)
Background:
India is on track to achieve
20% ethanol blending in petrol
within the next
two months
, a milestone that was originally expected to be met in 2026.
According to
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari
, the country will now produce
1,100 crore litres
of fuel ethanol annually, supporting
energy security, reducing oil imports, and benefiting farmers
To meet this demand, the government is
expanding ethanol production
using
sugar, rice, and maize
, while increasing the capacity of distilleries.
Sources of Ethanol Production:
The government plans to produce ethanol from
multiple sources
to ensure a stable supply. The key feedstocks include:
Sugar and Molasses
– Expected to contribute
400 crore litres
Food Corporation of India (FCI) Rice
– Will provide
110 crore litres
of ethanol.
Broken Rice and Maize
– Estimated to supply around
With ethanol distillery capacity ramped up to
1,600 crore litres
, the government is ensuring
adequate production levels
through subsidies, incentives, and infrastructure investments.
Role of Maize in Ethanol Production:
Maize has emerged as a
key ethanol feedstock
, with
increased cultivation and imports
supporting the ethanol push.
Key Developments in Maize Production:
Maize imports surged
in 2024, with India importing
₹100 crore worth of maize between April and June
Maize cultivation expanded by 10%
, with higher yields boosting supply.
Major maize-producing states
Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh
The 2024-25 ethanol year is expected to yield
42 million tonnes of maize
9 million tonnes allocated to ethanol production
Experts believe that
higher maize cultivation will reduce import dependency
in the future, ensuring a stable ethanol supply chain.
Government Policy Initiatives:
The government has introduced
policy reforms and incentives
to support ethanol production:
Reduction in FCI Rice Price
– Price lowered from
₹28/kg to ₹22.5/kg
to make ethanol production more cost-effective.
Dual-Feed Distilleries
– Sugar mills are
modifying infrastructure
to produce ethanol from both sugar and maize.
Financial Incentives
– Ethanol producers benefit from
subsidized loans, guaranteed procurement, and long-term contracts
These measures are
strengthening ethanol production
and ensuring
economic benefits for farmers
Economic and Environmental Impact of Ethanol Blending:
Reducing India’s Oil Import Bill
India imports
₹10.5 lakh crore worth of crude oil annually
. Ethanol blending can save
₹6,000 crore
of ethanol produced.
Boosting Farmer Incomes
With ethanol demand rising,
farmers are shifting to maize cultivation
, earning better returns than traditional crops.
Sustainable Fuel Alternative
Ethanol is a
clean fuel
that reduces carbon emissions, contributing to India’s
climate goals and energy security
Challenges & Future Outlook:
Impact on Food Security
– Higher maize allocation to ethanol may affect
poultry, livestock feed, and human consumption
Need for Infrastructure Upgrades
– More
distilleries and supply chain improvements
are needed to handle higher production.
Market Stability Concerns
– Ensuring stable ethanol prices without affecting
food prices
remains a policy challenge.
Despite these concerns, experts believe that
ethanol blending is a game-changer for India’s energy sector
, promoting
self-reliance and sustainability
Conclusion:
target marks a
major milestone
in its transition to
sustainable energy sources
With a
strong policy push, increased maize production, and expanded distilleries
, the country is set to
reduce oil imports, support farmers, and enhance energy security
The future of ethanol in India depends on
continued investment, technological advancements, and balancing food security with fuel needs
. If executed well, India could become
a global leader in biofuel production

**********Fentanyl crisis in the US
Why in news?
Recently, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada and 10% on China, citing a high trade deficit.
During a press briefing, Trump linked the tariffs to the fentanyl crisis, accusing China of supplying the drug and Mexico and Canada of enabling its entry into the US.
What’s in today’s article?
The Scale of the Opioid Epidemic
Challenges in dealing with the fentanyl crisis
Fentanyl is a potent
synthetic opioid
approved for pain relief and anesthesia. It is about 100 times stronger than morphine and 50 times stronger than heroin.
Opioids are drugs that originate from or mimic substances found in the opium poppy plant
They provide pain relief and can cause euphoria but are highly addictive.
Apart from fentanyl, other well-known opioids include oxycodone, morphine, codeine, and heroin.
Risks and Effects
Overdosing on fentanyl can lead to severe health issues, including stupor, changes in pupil size, clammy skin, cyanosis (blue skin), coma, and respiratory failure, which can be fatal.
The US is experiencing an opioid epidemic, with drug overdose deaths in 2021 being more than six times higher than in 1999.
In 2021, over 75% of the nearly 107,000 overdose deaths involved opioids.
Addiction and Prescription Painkillers
Many individuals begin using prescription opioid painkillers and become addicted due to the drug's immediate effects, which wear off quickly, causing users to seek more.
Impact of Synthetic Opioids
Since 2013, deaths related to synthetic opioids, particularly illicit fentanyl and its analogues like acetyl fentanyl and carfentanil, have increased significantly.
Fentanyl in Other Drugs
A recent US House Committee report revealed that inexpensive fentanyl is often mixed into other drugs, sometimes without the buyers' knowledge, exacerbating the crisis.
China’s Role in the Fentanyl Epidemic
China has been blamed for trafficking fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances to the US, with
fentanyl often shipped through international mail and express consignment operations
, according to a 2020 DEA report.
Investigators found that several companies in Wuhan and Shanghai are involved in manufacturing chemicals used to produce synthetic opioids, which are then shipped to Mexico for processing into pills.
The Chinese Communist Party is accused of indirectly subsidizing fentanyl production by offering tax rebates to companies involved in manufacturing precursor chemicals, which are often used in illegal opioid production.
Efforts to tackle the fentanyl crisis are hindered by strained diplomatic relations between the US and China.
While there have been occasional steps toward cooperation, the deteriorating ties have made it difficult to address the issue effectively.
Role of Local Governments in China
Fentanyl production provides employment in many Chinese provinces, making it harder to combat the issue locally.
To avoid law enforcement, operators often alter the chemical formulas slightly.
China’s Blame on the US
China has shifted some blame onto the US, arguing that the opioid crisis began long before fentanyl.
It points to the actions of US pharmaceutical companies like Purdue Pharma, which have been accused of over-prescribing opioids, leading to widespread addiction and demand for stronger drugs.

**********The Kind of Jobs Needed for the ‘Viksit Bharat’ Goal
Context
Union Budget plays a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of India's economy
, particularly in job creation.
While short-term measures such as tax relief can stimulate consumer demand,
long-term structural reforms are necessary to ensure sustained employment growth
and real wage increases.
2024 Budget introduced Employment Linked Incentives (ELI) under the Prime Minister’s five-scheme initiative,
aiming to generate over four crore jobs in five years.
However,
to realise the vision of a Viksit Bharat, it is imperative to deliberate on the kind of jobs that need to be created.
Essential Categories of Employment That India Must Focus On
Climate-Resilient Jobs
Climate change is an
urgent and escalating concern.
In 2019, India ranked as the seventh most-affected country by climate change,
suffering a $159 billion income loss in 2021.
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) estimates
that adaptation
costs will reach nearly $1 trillion by 2030.
impact of climate change
on agriculture, labour productivity, and livelihoods
necessitates massive investments in rural and urban adaptation strategies.
AI-Resilient Jobs
rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses a significant challenge to employment
, particularly in the IT and business services sectors, which currently account for over 70% of India’s service exports.
According to McKinsey Global Institute,
50% of automation adoption in India could take place within the next decade.
Technologies such as metaGPT, AI-powered coding
, and chatbot-driven customer service are already replacing human jobs,
raising concerns about employment sustainability.
Aspiration-Centric Jobs
India’s youth, particularly in rural areas, face a paradox.
While exposure to digital media and startup culture has broadened
their aspirations,
their foundational education, particularly in English and technical skills, remains weak.
Many still rely on government jobs
and coaching institutes to secure employment, reflecting a deeper insecurity rooted in their socio-economic backgrounds.
Necessary Measures for India to Focus on Essential Categories of Employment
A Response to Environmental and Economic Challenges
To address climate related challenges,
job creation must align with sustainability goals.
government can introduce large-scale programs
that create employment while promoting environmental resilience.
For example,
state-subsidised e-rickshaws could be provided in six lakh villages, generating two million jobs,
particularly for women, while improving last-mile mobility.
Similarly,
investments in compressed biogas plants can bridge the gap between the current 82 plants and the ambitious target of 5,000 set in 2018.
Additionally,
accelerating the 500GW non-fossil energy capacity target can generate over one million jobs,
particularly in decentralized and rooftop solar, which is seven times more labour-intensive than conventional energy projects.
These initiatives not only enhance employment but also contribute to India's net-zero goals
for 2070.
Safeguarding Employment in the Age of Automation
To counteract the effects of AI,
India must focus on AI-resilient jobs that prioritise human creativity and physical engagement.
One avenue is
expanding investment in education and healthcare,
addressing the shortage of teachers and healthcare professionals across states.
enhancing support for the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) can empower rural artisans
, farmers, and craftsperson by connecting them with global and urban markets.
These initiatives not only create sustainable employment but also safeguard traditional industries
from AI-driven disruptions.
Meeting the Needs of India’s Ambitious Youth
Job creation must align with youth aspirations.
One effective strategy is
rapid infrastructure development
, such as constructing
70,000 integrated pack-houses
to address the existing 95% infrastructure gap in agricultural supply chains, generating over two million jobs.
boosting local manufacturing of agri-inputs and promoting high-value exports
can create sustainable off-farm employment opportunities.
Rebranding rural industries and leveraging digital platforms can also make these jobs more attractive.
For example, accelerating the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oilseeds could
reduce India’s 57% import dependence on edible oils
while revitalizing rural oilseed processing.
This initiative, coupled with greater use of technology and social media for marketing, can turn traditional rural jobs into aspirational career paths.
Moreover, fostering
public-private partnerships
in large-scale industries can provide a structured employment ecosystem, addressing the frustrations of youth facing examination leaks and low recruitment vacancies.
Conclusion
While tax relief and short-term policies can provide temporary economic boosts,
India needs long-term structural reforms to sustain employment and wage growth.
government must focus on climate-resilient jobs that support sustainability, AI-resilient jobs that protect human creativity, and aspiration-centric jobs
that align with youth ambitions.
By strategically investing in these areas, India can not only mitigate the risks of climate change and automation but also unlock the full potential of its workforce
, paving the way for a truly developed Viksit Bharat

**********Some Wind Behind the Sails of India’s Shipping Industry
Context
The
Indian government has made significant strides in developing the maritime sector
, an area largely neglected by previous administrations.
While
these efforts have contributed to economic growth and improved infrastructure,
the Indian
shipping industry remains stagnant.
Several structural challenges
, including financial constraints, regulatory hurdles, and tax disparities,
continue to hinder its competitiveness.
An Analysis of Progress Under Sagarmala and Stagnation in the Shipping Industry
The Sagarmala Programme, launched to enhance India’s maritime infrastructure, has made significant progress.
As of September 2024,
839 projects
requiring an investment of
₹5.8 lakh crore
have been outlined, with
241 projects (₹1.22 lakh crore) completed
234 projects (₹1.8 lakh crore) under implementation
364 projects (₹2.78 lakh crore) in various stages of development
The programme has focused on
port modernization (₹2.91 lakh crore)
port connectivity (₹2.06 lakh crore)
port-led industrialisation (₹55.8 thousand crore)
coastal community development
The impact of these initiatives is evident in India’s
, with GDP increasing from
₹153 trillion in 2016-17 to ₹272 trillion in 2022-23
, despite setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Similarly,
India’s EXIM trade grew from $66 billion in 2016-17 to $116 billion in 2022
, reflecting a
77% cumulative increase
The government has set ambitious targets, aiming to achieve a
$5 trillion economy by 2027 and a $7 trillion economy by 2030
, with exports projected to reach
$2 trillion by 2030
Despite the progress in port infrastructure, the Indian shipping industry has not experienced commensurate growth.
Cargo handled at major ports has only increased
marginally
1,071.76 million tons in 2016-17 to 1,249.99 million tons in 2020-21
, an annual growth rate of just
2.85%
More concerning is the decline in the number of vessels handled at ports, which dropped from
21,655 in 2016-17 to 20,371 in 2020-21
—a
5.93% decrease
Additionally, the
Indian-registered fleet
has grown at a slow pace, increasing from
1,313 ships in 2016-17 to 1,526 in 2024
While the average age of the Indian fleet has improved from
26 years to 21 years
due to recent acquisitions, India’s
global ship ownership ranking has slipped from 17th to 19th
This decline indicates that investments in port infrastructure alone have not translated into a stronger domestic shipping sector.
Indian shipping companies continue to
lose market share
to foreign-flag vessels in EXIM trade and to rail and road transport for domestic cargo movement.
Challenges Hindering the Shipping Industry
Capital Constraints and High Borrowing Costs
Indian shipping companies face
high borrowing costs
short loan tenures
strict collateral requirements
Unlike foreign counterparts, Indian shipowners cannot use ships as collateral, making financing difficult.
Additionally, lenders do not fully understand the
cyclical nature
of the industry, leading to rigid loan restructuring policies.
Unfavourable Tax Policies
Indian-flagged ships are subject to
5% IGST on purchase price
, a tax not imposed on foreign vessels operating in Indian waters.
Moreover,
Indian shipowners must deduct TDS on seafarers' salaries
, whereas foreign vessels employing Indian seafarers do not have to.
These disparities make Indian vessels significantly less competitive.
Shipbuilding Challenges
India’s shipbuilding industry suffers from
inadequate infrastructure
high input costs (especially steel)
dependence on imports for spare parts
delays in vessel deliveries
customs duties on imported machinery
increase production costs, while a
lack of skilled workforce
reduces efficiency.
These issues discourage shipowners from investing in Indian shipyards.
Competition from Foreign-Flagged Vessels
Foreign-flagged vessels, often registered in tax havens, enjoy
easier access to capital, lower borrowing costs, and lenient regulations
Their ownership structures allow them to operate with
minimal regulatory oversight
, making them far more competitive than Indian-flagged ships.
Policy Measures and Recent Government Initiatives
Maritime Development Fund (MDF)
A ₹25,000 crore fund aimed at improving access to capital for shipowners.
However, only
49% of this fund will come from the government
, with the rest dependent on major ports, raising concerns about its sustainability.
Infrastructure Status for Large Vessels
: This status allows shipping companies to access benefits similar to those in other infrastructure sectors.
Customs Duty Exemption on Shipbuilding Spares:
The government has extended this exemption for another
10 years
Revamped Financial Assistance Policy
This includes
credit incentives for shipbreaking
and an
extension of the tonnage tax scheme to inland vessels
While these initiatives are steps in the right direction,
they may not be sufficient
given the
capital-intensive
nature of the shipping and shipbuilding sectors.
clarity is needed
on how the ₹25,000 crore MDF will be mobilized and distributed over the coming years.
The Way Forward: The Need for Comprehensive Reforms
Long-Term Financing at Competitive Interest Rates
: The industry requires
loan tenures of 7-10 years
with lower interest rates to facilitate ship acquisition and modernization.
Expansion of Shipbuilding Infrastructure
: India must invest in
new shipyards
modernise existing ones
to build
large vessels
and reduce dependence on imports.
Tax Reforms to Level the Playing Field
: Removing
IGST on ship purchases
exempting Indian seafarers from TDS requirements
will improve competitiveness.
Encouraging External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs)
: If strategically utilised, ECBs could help bridge the funding gap in the maritime sector.
Investment in Green Technology
: To meet
global emissions reduction targets
, India must promote
eco-friendly shipbuilding and retrofitting of existing vessels
Conclusion
has significantly improved India’s maritime infrastructure, its benefits have not translated into proportional growth in the shipping industry.
Structural challenges
, including capital constraints, tax disparities, and shipbuilding inefficiencies, continue to limit India’s competitiveness.
Only by addressing these critical challenges
the nation fully leverage its maritime potential and strengthen its position
in international trade.

**********Newly discovered asteroid 2024 YR4 may hit Earth in 2032
Why in news?
NASA and the European Space Agency are monitoring asteroid 2024 YR4, which has a 1.2% chance of hitting Earth on December 22, 2032.
The director of NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies stated there is a 99% chance it will miss but acknowledged it warrants attention. Further observations will refine the impact probability.
What’s in today’s article?
Asteroid
Asteroid Deflection: Strategies to Prevent Potential Collisions
Potential Destruction from 2024 YR4
An
is a small, rocky object that orbits the Sun, primarily found in the
asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter.
Unlike planets, asteroids are irregularly shaped and much smaller.
They are remnants from the early solar system, formed about
4.6 billion years ago
Some asteroids cross Earth's orbit and are classified as
Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)
, which are closely monitored for potential collisions.
Frequency of Asteroid Collisions
Thousands of asteroids enter Earth’s atmosphere daily, but most burn up due to friction.
Some larger ones appear as fireballs, and small fragments may reach the surface without causing significant damage.
Impact of Large Asteroids
Asteroids over a kilometer wide, like the
Chicxulub asteroid
that caused the dinosaur extinction, strike Earth very rarely—approximately once every 260 million years.
The vastness of the Solar System makes such impacts unlikely.
Threat from Smaller Asteroids
Smaller asteroids can still cause regional damage. For instance, the
Chelyabinsk meteor
caused widespread destruction.
A 40-meter-wide asteroid could devastate an entire city, depending on its speed and angle of entry.
Space agencies like NASA are developing planetary defense strategies to prevent catastrophic asteroid collisions with Earth.
The DART Mission
NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, was the first planetary defense mission.
Successful Asteroid Deflection
In 2022, the DART spacecraft crashed into the asteroid Dimorphos, altering its shape and trajectory.
Though Dimorphos was not a threat to Earth, this mission demonstrated the feasibility of asteroid deflection.
Discovery and Characteristics of 2024 YR4
was discovered in December by a telescope in Chile.
It is a
near-Earth asteroid
measuring
40 to 100 meters
, roughly the size of a football field.
Close Approach to Earth
The asteroid passed 800,000 km from Earth on Christmas Day 2023, about twice the distance of the Moon.
It will fade from view in the coming months and reappear in
2028
Current Observations and Challenges
Scientists are using powerful telescopes to study 2024 YR4’s path and size before it becomes too faint by mid-April.
Determining its exact size is challenging because brightness depends on reflectivity, making it hard to distinguish between a large dark asteroid and a small reflective one.
While
is not as large as the asteroid that caused the dinosaur extinction, it could cause
significant localized damage
if it impacts a populated area.
Destruction Potential: Torino Scale Rating
NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) has rated 2024 YR4 a
on the
Torino Scale (0 to 10)
, indicating a moderate risk.
The Torino Scale is a risk assessment tool that categorizes the potential impact of asteroids on Earth.
It uses a scale of 0 to 10, with higher numbers indicating a greater likelihood of impact and more severe consequences.
In comparison, the Apophis asteroid was initially rated 4 but later downgraded after further observations.
Energy Release and Impact Comparison
If 2024 YR4 crashes into Earth, it is expected to release 8 to 10 megatons of energy.
By comparison, the Chelyabinsk meteor (February 2013) released 500 kilotons, injuring 1,500 people and damaging thousands of buildings.
2024 YR4 is about twice its size, meaning its impact could be significantly more powerful.

**********Future of USAID - Implications and Global Impact
Why in News?
The future of the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is uncertain
, with the Trump administration planning its merger with the US Department of State.
This move involves significant funding cuts and a potential downsizing of USAID's workforce,
raising concerns about the future of US humanitarian aid
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is USAID and Its Role?
USAID's Budget and Global Spending
Why is the Trump Administration Targeting USAID?
Can Trump Unilaterally Shut Down USAID?
Global Impact of USAID’s Closure
Conclusion
About USAID:
It was established in the
1960s
to
oversee and administer international humanitarian aid
USAID was established under
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961
, making its existence
legally mandated by Congress.
It employs approximately 10,000 personnel, with operations in over 60 countries.
Its key areas of work include:
Food security:
USAID provides famine relief and operates an advanced food shortage prediction system.
Healthcare:
It funds vaccination programs, pandemic prevention, and global disease control.
Infrastructure and development:
The agency supports clean water initiatives, disaster relief, and economic development programs.
Humanitarian aid:
USAID plays a vital role in war-torn regions like Ukraine and sub-Saharan Africa.
USAID's Budget and Global Spending:
In 2023, the US allocated
$68 billion
to international aid, with
USAID receiving over half
($40 billion).
The largest share of USAID funds is directed toward
Asia, Africa, and Europe
, particularly
The US remains the
largest global donor
, outspending other major aid contributors like the UK.
Criticism of foreign aid spending:
Donald Trump:
He has long criticized foreign aid, arguing
it lacks value for US taxpayers
. Trump issued an executive order pausing international spending for 90 days, leading to the suspension of multiple aid programs.
Public opinion:
Polls indicate that American voters have historically favored reducing foreign aid.
Elon Musk:
A key Trump advisor, Musk has pushed for drastic spending cuts, leading to tensions between USAID and the administration.
Impact of spending freeze:
Critical programs, such as medical aid and clean water initiatives, were halted.
Security concerns arose, with reports of prison guards in Syria (responsible for detaining Islamic State militants) nearly abandoning their posts due to funding cuts.
International aid workers described the move as
a severe disruption to global humanitarian efforts.
Any attempt to abolish it would
likely face legal challenges
and require congressional approval.
An alternative strategy
under consideration is restructuring USAID as a branch of the State Department, similar to the UK's 2020 merger of its international aid department with the Foreign Office.
Global Impact of USAID’s Closure:
Humanitarian crisis:
Cuts in funding may impact critical programs like mine clearance, pandemic response, and prosthetic aid for war victims.
Foreign policy concerns:
Critics argue the move could reduce US global influence and damage diplomatic relationships.
Security implications:
Funding disruptions could lead to instability in conflict zones where USAID plays a vital role.
Geopolitical shift:
A weakened US aid presence might allow
countries like China to expand
their influence through alternative development projects.
Conclusion:
The proposed restructuring or closure of USAID represents
a major shift in US foreign policy,
aligning with Trump's "
America First
" vision.
While supporters argue that cutting foreign aid saves taxpayer money, critics warn that such a move could have profound humanitarian and geopolitical consequences.
The global development sector remains on high alert for further changes in US aid policy.
