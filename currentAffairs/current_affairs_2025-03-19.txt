IUCN GREEN LIST
Prelims – ENVIRONMENT
The IUCN Green List is seeing growth with the addition of four new listings from West Asia, marking a positive trend toward effective and equitable area-based conservation.
Four new sites included are Sharaan Nature Reserve and King Abdulaziz Royal Nature Reserve of Saudi Arabia, Aqaba Marine Reserve of Jordan and Sir Bu Nair Protected Area from UAE.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas is a global initiative aimed at recognizing and promoting effective, equitable, and successful management of protected and conserved areas worldwide.
It serves as a benchmark for quality in nature conservation, ensuring that these areas deliver tangible benefits for both people and nature.
Objectives of the IUCN Green List:
Enhance Conservation Outcomes: Increase the number of protected and conserved areas that achieve successful conservation results through effective management and governance.
Provide a Global Benchmark: Offer a globally consistent standard to measure and improve the performance of protected and conserved areas.
The IUCN Green List Standard is structured around four key components, each encompassing specific criteria:
Good Governance: Ensures that the area is managed transparently, inclusively, and accountably, respecting the rights of stakeholders and indigenous communities.
Sound Design and Planning: Focuses on clear, long-term conservation goals based on a comprehensive understanding of the area’s natural, cultural, and socio-economic values.
Effective Management: Involves implementing strategies and actions that are efficient, adaptive, and based on the best available knowledge to maintain or enhance the area’s values.
Successful Conservation Outcomes: Measures the achievement of tangible and positive results in conserving the area’s values, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health.
The path to Green List certification involves several stages:
Application Phase: Protected areas submit an application and provide initial documentation demonstrating commitment to the Green List indicators.
Candidate Phase: Upon acceptance, the site undergoes a thorough evaluation against all criteria, including stakeholder consultations and site visits.
Green List Phase: Successful sites are awarded Green List status, recognized for their excellence in conservation, and are subject to periodic reviews to ensure ongoing compliance.
There are no Indian sites listed on the IUCN Green List

FIVE EYES ALLIANCE
Prelims – CURRENT EVENT
In a major step for cooperation on global security, intelligence chiefs and national security advisers of several countries including three members of the Five Eyes alliance have gathered in New Delhi. Besides key meetings, the intel chiefs will attend The Raisina Dialogue – a multilateral conference organised by the Observer Research Foundation and India’s Ministry of External Affairs.
Once a covert intelligence-sharing network, Five Eyes has evolved into an expansive global surveillance apparatus, operating with little accountability. While some nations have challenged its overreach, the dominance of the US and UK has ensured that, in most cases, its actions remain shielded from meaningful consequences.
The Five Eyes (FVEY) is an intelligence-sharing alliance comprising five English-speaking countries: United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
Origins and Evolution
The alliance originated during World War II with the UKUSA Agreement (1946) between the United States and the United Kingdom, later expanding to include Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
It was initially focused on signals intelligence (SIGINT), particularly intercepting Soviet communications during the Cold War.
Over time, the alliance has expanded its scope to counterterrorism, cyber threats, and geopolitical intelligence sharing.
Significance and Role
The Five Eyes countries share classified intelligence, gathered through various means, including electronic surveillance, cybersecurity monitoring, and human intelligence.
It is one of the most comprehensive intelligence alliances in the world, with vast capabilities in surveillance, counterespionage, and cybersecurity.
The alliance also cooperates on emerging threats like China’s growing technological influence, Russian cyber activities, and terrorism networks.

WHITE HYDROGEN
Prelims & Mains – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
France has discovered a massive 46-million-ton white hydrogen reserve in the Moselle region, valued at $92 trillion.
Hydrogen is considered the future of clean energy. Unlike solar or wind energy, it produces only water when burned.
The discovery challenges previous assumptions that hydrogen must be lab-produced, proving it exists naturally.
Based on its production method and environmental impact, hydrogen is classified into several types:
Grey Hydrogen
Source: Produced from natural gas or fossil fuels using steam methane reforming (SMR).
Emissions: High carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions since no carbon capture technology is used.
Usage: Currently, the most common form of hydrogen used in industry, refineries, and chemical production.
Blue Hydrogen
Source: Similar to grey hydrogen (produced from natural gas) but with Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technology.
Emissions: Lower than grey hydrogen, as up to 90% of CO₂ emissions are captured.
Usage: Considered a transition fuel in the shift to green hydrogen.
Green Hydrogen
Source: Produced using electrolysis of water, powered by renewable energy sources like solar or wind.
Emissions: Unlike others, this “white hydrogen” requires no industrial production and emits no CO₂.
Usage: The most sustainable form of hydrogen, used in fuel cells, transportation, and energy storage.
White Hydrogen
Source: Naturally occurring underground hydrogen deposits.
Emissions: Zero, but not yet commercially viable due to extraction challenges.
Usage: Research is ongoing to explore its potential.
Pink Hydrogen
Source: Produced via electrolysis powered by nuclear energy.
Emissions: Low, as nuclear power does not generate carbon emissions.
Usage: Can be a stable alternative where nuclear power is available.

CREATOR ECONOMY
Mains – GS 3
India’s creator economy is booming, fueled by easier internet access. The government has introduced a $1 billion fund and Rs 391 crore for the Indian Institute of Creative Technology to boost the industry.
In December last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the creator economy is bringing new energy to India’s efforts to become a $5 trillion economy.
The Creator Economy refers to the digital ecosystem where individuals monetize their skills, content, and influence via digital platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Patreon, and Substack.
It includes influencers, bloggers, video creators, podcasters, artists, and educators who generate income through ads, sponsorships, subscriptions, digital products, and direct fan support.
Importance of the Creator Economy to India
Economic Growth and Job Creation
India’s creator economy is estimated to contribute significantly to the gig economy, offering self-employment opportunities to millions.
Platforms like YouTube and Instagram enable content creators to earn through ad revenue, brand partnerships, and merchandise sales.
Democratization of Opportunities
Unlike traditional media, digital platforms allow anyone with skills and creativity to succeed.
Small-town and rural creators are finding success, overcoming geographical limitations. Vernacular content (in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.) is booming, reaching diverse audiences.
Cultural and Soft Power Impact
Indian creators are shaping global narratives about Indian culture, food, travel, and traditions.
Yoga instructors, Bollywood influencers, and digital storytellers increase India’s soft power internationally. India’s memes, dance trends, and viral content gain global recognition, enhancing cultural influence.
Digital Entrepreneurship & Innovation
The creator economy fosters digital entrepreneurship, allowing creators to monetize through NFTs, courses, books, and memberships.
Indian startups are developing tools and platforms (e.g., Chingari, Koo) to empower creators and reduce dependence on global platforms.
Financial Inclusion & Alternative Livelihoods
Many creators are first-time earners, boosting financial inclusion, especially for women, students, and freelancers.
Platforms provide an alternative to traditional employment, enabling financial independence.

**********India’s Ranking in Global Free Speech Index: Key Insights
Why in the News?
A new global survey by The Future of Free Speech, an independent U.S.-based think tank, has ranked India 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed on the question of support for free speech.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Free Speech Index (Basics, India’s Rankings, Global Trend, Key Findings, Challenges, etc.)
India’s Ranking in Free Speech Index:
A recent global survey by
, a U.S.-based think tank, has ranked India
24th out of 33 surveyed countries
in terms of support for free speech.
The report, titled "Who in the World Supports Free Speech?", reveals a concerning decline in the global commitments to protect controversial speech, with India being
an exception where public perception and actual free speech conditions do not align
Global Trends in Free Speech:
The survey, conducted in
October 2024
, found that:
Scandinavian countries dominate the index, with
Norway
(87.9) and
Denmark
(87.0) securing the top positions.
Indonesia (56.8), Malaysia (55.4), and Pakistan (57.0) showed the biggest improvements despite being lower in the rankings.
Hungary (85.5) and Venezuela (81.8), despite being authoritarian-leaning, ranked high due to public perception of free speech.
, with a
score of 62.6
, was placed between South Africa (66.9) and Lebanon (61.8).
Key Findings About Free Speech in India:
Public Support for Free Expression vs. Reality
The majority of Indians believe in free speech without government censorship.
However, support for criticizing government policies is lower than the global average.
Strong Support for Government Restrictions on Criticism
37% of Indian respondents agreed that the government should prevent people from criticizing its policies—the highest among all surveyed countries.
Comparatively, this sentiment was supported by: 5% in the U.K and 3% in Denmark.
This suggests that a significant section of Indians favours restrictions on political speech, reflecting growing support for government control over public discourse.
Discrepancy Between Public Perception and International Assessment
Indians and South Africans felt their ability to speak freely had improved.
However, global rankings indicate a decline in free speech protection in India, highlighting a disconnect between perception and actual conditions.
India’s Position in Democratic Backsliding
The report identifies India as a country experiencing "democratic backsliding", similar to Hungary and Venezuela.
While free speech laws exist in principle, their enforcement is weak, and restrictions on dissent are increasing.
Challenges to Free Speech in India:
Legal and Political Restrictions
India’s sedition law (Section 124A of the IPC) had been used to suppress political dissent.
Section 124A of the IPC, has been removed from the BNS.
However, the BNS retains the essence of Section 124A in Section 152, which penalizes actions that incite secession, armed rebellion, or subversive activities, encourage separatist activities, or endanger the sovereignty or unity of India.
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) has been criticized for targeting journalists, activists, and opposition voices.
IT Rules 2021 give the government broad powers to regulate social media and digital content, leading to censorship concerns.
Rise in Self-Censorship
Fear of legal repercussions and online harassment discourages open expression.
Media houses and journalists often face political and economic pressures, leading to biased reporting or avoidance of critical issues.
Selective Tolerance for Free Speech
While free speech is widely supported in principle, it is often opposed when it contradicts political beliefs or religious sentiments.
The arrests of activists, journalists, and stand-up comedians highlight inconsistent application of free speech rights.
Way Forward:
Reaffirming Legal Protections
Repealing or amending outdated laws and UAPA provisions that suppress dissent.
Strengthening judicial oversight to prevent misuse of laws against activists and journalists.
Promoting a Culture of Open Debate
Educational institutions and media should encourage free discussion on diverse perspectives.
Political parties should commit to respecting free speech rights across ideological lines.
Enhancing Digital and Media Freedom
Strengthening laws that protect journalists from government pressure and corporate influence.
Ensuring that social media regulations do not lead to arbitrary censorship.
Aligning Public Perception with Reality
Raising awareness about constitutional free speech protections.
Encouraging fact-based discussions on government policies and political discourse.

Social Issues
**********The Dystopian Side of Insta-Commerce
Context
Labour exploitation has been a persistent issue
in capitalist economies, particularly in urban settings where daily wage workers gather in large numbers at labour markets, seeking employment for the day.
With the rise of digital platforms
and the gig economy,
this exploitation has been restructured
and intensified through technology.
Now
it becomes crucial to critically examine both traditional labour markets and modern gig platforms
, highlighting the mechanisms of exploitation and the lack of labour rights.
The Traditional Labour Market and the Role of Middlemen
The traditional labour market, as seen in urban centres,
operates as a form of daily or piece-rate employment
where workers congregate at labour chowks or mazdoor mandis, waiting for employment.
In this setup,
thekedars (middlemen) play a crucial role
in facilitating the hiring process.
However,
their role is primarily exploitative
, as they negotiate the lowest possible wages for workers while maximising profits for employers.
This
system places workers in a position of vulnerability,
as they are forced to accept whatever terms are offered due to a lack of alternative employment options.
imbalance of power in such labour markets makes it difficult for workers to negotiate
fair wages or working conditions.
A Detailed Analysis of The Digitalisation of Labour Exploitation: The Gig Economy
The Shift from Physical to Virtual Labour Markets
, driven by digital platforms, has
transformed the way work is structured and managed.
While these platforms present themselves as providers of flexibility and opportunity,
they function primarily as intermediaries
that maximise profits by exploiting workers.
digitalisation of labour has not eliminated exploitation
but has
instead restructured i
t in a way that makes it more difficult to detect and regulate.
Just as
traditional labour markets rely on thekedars (middlemen) to negotiate
the lowest wages for workers,
gig platforms use algorithms to perform the same function
, but on a much larger and more efficient scale.
Algorithmic Control and the Illusion of Autonomy
Gig workers
, such as drivers, delivery personnel, and domestic workers,
appear to have control over their schedules and earnings.
this so-called flexibility is highly misleading.
The platforms’ algorithms dictate almost every aspect of their work, including:
Work Availability
platform decides when and how many jobs are offered to a worker
based on opaque performance metrics.
Workers who reject too many tasks may find themselves de-prioritised
by the algorithm.
Wage Determination
Workers are
not paid fixed wages but rather earn money per task.
The platform dynamically adjusts prices based on demand, often driving wages down when there is an oversupply of workers.
Workload Distribution
Unlike traditional jobs where employees can negotiate hours and contracts,
gig workers are constantly on standby, checking their phones for job opportunities.
This uncertainty forces them to accept whatever is available, leading to excessive work hours with no job security.
Wage Suppression and the Downward Bidding System
Gig platforms replicate the traditional labour chowk system,
where workers bid for jobs in a race to the bottom.
In the digital space,
this process is automated, making it even more ruthless.
Instead of an employer selecting the cheapest worker manually,
algorithms match workers with tasks based on pricing models that prioritise lower wages.
Workers are forced to accept whatever is offered
, as refusing too many jobs may lead to reduced work opportunities in the future.
Absence of Social Security and Worker Protections
In traditional employment models, workers receive benefits such as health insurance, paid leave, and pension contributions.
Gig workers, however, are classified as
independent contractors
, meaning that platforms do not provide any form of social security.
This classification allows companies to avoid responsibilities such as:
Minimum wage guarantees
Medical benefits
Compensation for accidents or work-related injuries
Protection against sudden job termination
Since gig workers are not formally employed,
they have no legal recourse in case of exploitation, unfair dismissal, or wage theft.
The absence of employer accountability creates
a system where workers bear all the risks while platforms reap the profits.
The Legislative Struggle for Gig Workers’ Rights and Hypocrisy and the PR Game of Gig Economy Platforms
Recognising the plight of gig workers, l
abour movements in India have pushed for legal protections,
particularly in states like
Rajasthan and Karnataka.
Proposed legislation
sought to provide gig workers with social security, access to real-time work data,
and mechanisms for grievance redressal.
these efforts have been systematically blocked by powerful corporate interests.
Industry associations like NASSCOM and CII have lobbied against recognising gig workers
as employees, thereby denying them fundamental labour rights.
influence of these corporations on government policy demonstrates the prioritisation of business interests
over worker welfare.
One of the most striking aspects of the gig economy’s labour exploitation is the
duplicity of platform founders and executives.
publicly portraying themselves as champions of worker empowerment
, they simultaneously oppose any legislative measures that would grant workers’ rights and protections.
For instance,
services such as "Insta Maids," which offer domestic help at extremely low wages at Rs 49 for an hour
, exemplify this contradiction.
marketing rhetoric presents these jobs as pathways to financial security and dignity,
while in reality, they reinforce systemic exploitation.
Some of workers’ slogans point to the poignancy of the situation “
rating nahi, haq chaahiye (we don’t want ratings, we want rights)!
” and “
insaan hai hum, ghulaam nahi (we are human beings, not slaves)!”
refusal to acknowledge gig workers as employees and grant them legal protections reveals the corporate hypocrisy
behind these platforms.
Conclusion
gig economy has not introduced a new form of employment
but has rather
intensified and digitalised existing structures of exploitation.
By removing direct accountability and fragmenting the workforce,
digital platforms have made it even more difficult for workers to fight for their rights.
Legislative interventions are necessary to ensure that gig workers receive fair wages
, job security, and social protections.
Until strong labour laws are enforced
and corporate resistance is countered,
the gig economy will continue to function as a modern-day system of digital slavery.

Editorial Analysis
**********BSNL Has Been Dialling the Wrong Consultant
Context
The
increasing reliance of governments
and public sector enterprises
on private consultancy firms has sparked significant debate.
While consultancy firms offer expertise and external perspectives,
their growing influence raises critical concerns about state capacity, accountability,
and the alignment of their recommendations with public sector goals.
Amid this debate,
it is important to explore the implications of the consultancy industry's expansion within the public sector
and evaluates alternative approaches to strengthening government institutions.
The Rising Dependence on Consultancy Firms
The increasing use of consultancy firms by governments is
evident worldwide.
France, for example, spent over €1 billion
on consultancy services in 2021, while
Australia allocated A$21 billion for external labour hire in 2021-22.
This trend
indicates that governments are progressively delegating strategic functions
to private entities.
However,
this reliance contradicts the very purpose of external consultancy
, which is to provide solutions that promote self-sufficiency and long-term institutional stability.
Instead,
when governments consistently seek external advice
without developing internal expertise,
they risk creating an ongoing dependency
rather than achieving sustainable solutions.
Concerning Aspects of Excessive Reliance on Consultancy Firms
Erosion of Institutional Knowledge and Expertise
Traditionally, public sector organisations have built expertise over time
by training and retaining skilled employees who understand the nuances of governance, policy implementation, and public service management.
However, when external consultants are continuously engaged to perform key strategic functions,
the transfer of knowledge to public officials is limited or non-existent.
As a result,
government institutions become increasingly dependent on external expertise
for critical decision-making.
creates a negative feedback loop:
each time a major policy challenge arises, the public sector lacks the internal capacity to address it, leading to further engagement of consultancy firms.
Over time, this weakens the ability of the state to function autonomously
, making it perpetually reliant on private firms for strategic planning and policy execution.
Undermining Public Sector Legitimacy
Governments derive their legitimacy from their ability to govern effectively and make decisions in the best interest of their citizens.
When key functions are outsourced to external consultants, it signals a lack of confidence
in the government's own capacity to manage public enterprises.
reliance on private firms can diminish public trust
in government institutions.
Citizens may begin to question whether their elected representatives and public officials are truly in control of policymaking
or whether decisions are being driven by private-sector actors who do not have the same level of accountability.
perception can erode faith in democratic governance
and create scepticism about whether public resources are being managed effectively.
Creation of a Parallel Bureaucracy
Unlike government officials, who are subject to legislative oversight, public accountability, and democratic scrutiny,
consultants are not held to the same standards.
They wield significant influence over policy
and resource allocation but are not directly accountable to the public.
lack of oversight can lead to inefficiencies and misalignment
between public interests and the advice provided by consultants.
Since consultants are primarily motivated by profit and reputation rather than public service, their
recommendations may prioritise cost-cutting and efficiency over long-term social benefits.
Reduced Accountability and Democratic Oversight
Governments are accountable to the public through democratic institutions
, elections, and oversight mechanisms such as parliamentary committees, audits, and regulatory frameworks.
when key decision-making processes are outsourced
to consultancy firms, this
chain of accountability becomes weaker.
Unlike elected officials and civil servants,
consultancy firms do not have a direct obligation to the public.
Their contracts are often negotiated behind closed doors, with
little transparency
regarding their selection process,
the rationale behind their recommendations, or their long-term impact.
creates an environment where crucial public sector decisions are influenced by private entities
without sufficient scrutiny.
The Problem of Conflicts of Interest and The Mismatch Between Public and Private Sector Objectives
Consultancy firms often serve multiple clients across different sectors
, including both regulatory bodies and the industries they regulate.
overlapping engagement raises questions
about whether their advice is truly impartial.
If a consultancy firm is advising both a government agency and private competitors within the same industry,
there is a risk that its recommendations may be influenced by vested interests rather than the public good.
issue of conflict of interest has been widely debated,
leading some major consultancy firms to reconsider the structure of their operations.
as long as external firms are deeply embedded in public sector decision-making, concerns about their objectivity and integrity will persist.
Consultancy firms typically operate with a
market-driven approach
, focusing on efficiency, cost-cutting, and profitability.
While such strategies may be effective in private enterprise,
they do not always align with the broader mandate of public sector organisations.
For example,
BSNL, as a government enterprise, has played a critical role in bridging India's digital divide,
especially in rural areas where private telecom companies are reluctant to operate due to lower profit margins.
If Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) recommendations prioritise aggressive cost-cutting measures,
BSNL’s ability to serve rural
and underserved communities
could be compromised.
This highlights the
fundamental tension
between private consultancy-driven strategies and public service objectives.
Necessary Measures to Address the Issue of Over-Reliance on Consultancy Groups
Building Internal Capabilities as an Alternative
Rather than relying heavily on external consultancies,
governments should focus on strengthening their own institutions.
Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington, in their book
The Big Con: How the Consulting Industry Weakens our Businesses, Infantilises our Governments and Warps our Economies
, argue that
states should invest in developing internal expertise.
By recruiting skilled professionals, creating innovation, and encouraging long-term strategic planning within public institutions,
governments can reduce dependency on external consultants while improving governance and service delivery.
The Need for Greater Scrutiny and Accountability
BSNL-BCG case has reignited concerns about the growing influence of consultancy firms
in public governance.
central critique is that these firms do not have ‘skin in the game’
, they provide advice but bear no responsibility for the outcomes.
To address this issue,
greater scrutiny and oversight of consultancy contracts are necessary
Governments should
establish clear performance metrics for external consultants
, ensuring that their recommendations are subject to rigorous evaluation.
Additionally,
policies should be implemented to enhance transparency in the hiring of consultancy firms
, ensuring that public funds are spent effectively and in the public interest.
Conclusion
The case of BSNL and BCG serves as a reminder that strategic decision-making should not be outsourced
without careful consideration of its long-term implications.
To safeguard public interest,
governments should prioritise building internal expertise, focusing on institutional innovation,
and ensuring greater accountability in consultancy engagements.
By doing so, they can reclaim their ability to govern effectively and fulfil their public service mandates
without excessive reliance on external advisors.

Editorial Analysis
**********Jan Vishwas 2.0 - Reforming India's Criminal Justice System for Better Governance
Context:
The Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0
, recently announced by the Union government, aims to decriminalize minor infractions and rationalize legal provisions.
The proposed bill
must go beyond the framework used for version 1.0
, where asking civil servants to give up jail provisions led to meagre outcomes (nobody surrenders a stick; it must be taken away).
Jan Vishwas 3.0
is expected to follow at the state level to further enhance governance and reduce arbitrary enforcement of laws.
India’s Over-Criminalization Problem:
A new database by the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy highlights 174 years of legislative enactments across 882 central laws.
370 laws contain criminal provisions covering 7,305 crimes:
5,333 crimes attract jail terms.
982 requires mandatory minimum jail terms.
433 prescribes life imprisonment.
301 imposes the death penalty.
Only 25% of these crimes
relate to
core criminal justice laws
(e.g., Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, National Security Act), while the majority govern everyday activities.
Excessive and Arbitrary Criminal Provisions:
Many laws criminalize
trivial infractions
, such as:
Milking a cow on the street.
Failing to report an animal's death within three hours.
Neglecting to provide exercise to a pet dog.
Storing e-cigarettes.
These provisions lead to:
Arbitrary power exercises by officials.
Blurred distinctions
between minor infractions and serious crimes.
Disproportionate penalties
(e.g., six-month jail term for failing to maintain records under the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, the same as for unauthorized brain surgery).
Impact on Citizens and Governance:
Lack of awareness
about excessive criminal provisions leaves citizens
vulnerable to corruption and digital scams.
Over-reliance on criminalization
reflects challenges in imposing a modern state framework on an ancient civilization.
The justice system disproportionately impacts the poor
, who are more vulnerable to law enforcement excesses.
Low conviction rates
mean that the legal process itself becomes a form of punishment.
The Path to Decriminalization:
The Vidhi report suggests
four key principles
for rationalizing criminal laws:
Protection of value:
Criminalization should protect fundamental societal values and public interest.
Protection against harm:
Laws should be justified only if they prevent clear, identifiable, and substantial harm.
Effective and efficient solutions:
Criminalization should be used only when necessary to achieve legitimate legal objectives.
Proportionality:
Punishments should align with the gravity of the offense.
Laws should also be assessed for their impact on:
Human rights
Society
Fiscal burden
Justice system capacity
Conclusion - Towards a Balanced Justice System:
India has
75% of prison inmates as undertrials
3.5 crore pending criminal cases
Reforms
must shift the justice system toward
a restorative and rehabilitative
rather than retributive model.
As India moves toward
Viksit Bharat by 2047
, ensuring
ease of living
should be a priority.
The Jan Vishwas 2.0 and 3.0
initiatives seek to strike
a balance
finding the Madhyam Marg
between trusting and punishing citizens, and paving the way for a
more just legal system

**********National Wildlife Health Policy takes shape
Why in news?
Five years after the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre is reviewing a draft National Wildlife Health Policy (NWHP) to strengthen wildlife disease surveillance and research.
The policy proposes integrated monitoring systems, new diagnostic laboratories, and enhanced research efforts to track and prevent zoonotic diseases.
What’s in today’s article?
National Referral Centre for Wildlife (NRC-W)
National Wildlife Health Policy (NWHP) Under Review
Zoonotic diseases account for 60% of emerging infectious diseases worldwide, with 72% originating from wildlife.
India has experienced several localized but severe outbreaks, such as Kyasanur Forest Disease and Nipah virus.
These incidents highlight the urgent need for efficient disease monitoring in wild animal populations and continuous health surveillance of captive wild animals in zoological institutions across the country.
Against this backdrop, Centre has established the NRC-W.
NRC-W: An Ambitious Wildlife Health Initiative
The NRC-W has been established in Junagadh, Gujarat.
The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) under the Union Environment Ministry has prepared blueprints for its development, focusing on emerging infectious diseases, wildlife disease surveillance, and outbreak management.
Need for NRC-W: Addressing Zoonotic Threats
The establishment of NRC-W is crucial due to the rising emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic diseases.
Out of 1,407 human pathogens, 816 are zoonotic, posing a significant health risk.
NRC-W will strengthen disease detection, research, and safe handling of animals, preventing spillovers from wildlife to humans.
Advanced Research and Surveillance Facilities
NRC-W will be equipped with state-of-the-art investigation and surveillance technology to detect diseases in both animals and humans.
It will also support skill-based training, data analytics, and policy development to enhance wildlife health management.
NRC-W will bridge the gap between wildlife health, human health, and livestock programs, ensuring a holistic approach to One Health.
Collaborative Approach for Wildlife Health
NRC-W will function in collaboration with national and international institutes.
CZA will act as the nodal agency
, ensuring coordination between zoos and wildlife health programs across India.
Five years after the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre is reviewing an interim draft of the NWHP to enhance wildlife disease monitoring and research.
The policy proposes integrated surveillance systems, new diagnostic labs, and cross-sectoral collaborations to address zoonotic disease risks.
It aims to mitigate risks of wildlife-origin pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2, by improving early detection and response mechanisms.
Alignment with One Health Approach
Over 60% of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate from animals.
In this context, the NWHP aligns with the National One Health Mission, which integrates efforts across human, animal, and environmental health sectors.
Monitoring wildlife, both in the wild and in captivity, has become crucial for pandemic preparedness.
Key Stakeholders and Policy Formulation
CZA is leading the policy drafting, with consultations driven by the Principal Scientific Adviser’s office and support from IIT Bombay.
National Referral Centre for Wildlife (NRC-W) as a Key Hub
The National Referral Centre for Wildlife (NRC-W), inaugurated by PM Modi in Junagadh, Gujarat, will be a central authority for investigating wildlife mortalities, disease outbreaks, diagnostics, and treatments.
Bridging Information Gaps and Cross-Sectoral Coordination
Currently, wildlife disease surveillance is fragmented across different ministries and independent research efforts.
The policy aims to integrate data from the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Agriculture, and Department of Animal Husbandry to ensure better coordination.
Establishment of Wildlife Health Databases
The policy proposes a
National Wildlife Health Database
and a
Wildlife Health Information System
to centralize real-time and historical data.
These will complement existing systems like the
National Animal Disease Referral Expert System
to predict and prevent outbreaks.
Satellite Diagnostic Labs and Community Engagement
The policy recommends setting up
satellite diagnostic labs near key forest habitats to improve wildlife disease detection and response
It also emphasizes community engagement, such as vaccination programs for cattle near national parks, to prevent disease spillover from domestic to wild animals.

**********NASA Astronauts Safely Return To Earth After Delayed International Space Station Mission
Why in news?
NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams returned to Earth after a nine-month delay due to issues with Boeing’s spacecraft.
Both the astronauts had travelled to the
International Space Station (ISS)
in June 2024. They were initially supposed to return within a week, but their spacecraft, Boeing’s Starliner, developed issues, making it unsafe for their return.
What’s in today’s article?
Nine Months in Space
Boeing’s Starliner Test Mission
Delay in Return Arrangements
A Mission Marked by Uncertainty
Scientific Opportunity in Prolonged Stay
Williams and Wilmore’s 286-day stay is one of the longest but not a record.
Soviet cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov holds the record for the longest continuous stay in space at 438 days.
Other astronauts, including Russia’s Oleg Kononenko and US astronaut Peggy Whitson, have spent extensive time in space over multiple missions.
Their mission was primarily to test Boeing’s Starliner CST-100, a spacecraft developed under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program to transport astronauts to the ISS.
The spacecraft encountered technical issues, including a helium leak, even before launch but was allowed to proceed.
Further problems arose en-route to the ISS, preventing its safe return journey.
NASA had no immediate alternative to bring them back, as missions are planned well in advance.
The next scheduled return mission was set for February 2025, but with no urgent medical concerns, NASA allowed them to stay aboard the ISS, which can accommodate up to 12 astronauts.
Their extended stay drew global attention, redefining the idea of being stuck at work.
While longer space missions have occurred, none had experienced such an unexpected extension and uncertainty regarding their return.
Active Contributions During Extended Stay
Despite their situation, Wilmore and Williams fully integrated into the ISS crew, conducting experiments, repairing equipment, and even participating in spacewalks.
Williams’ Spacewalking Record
With 62 hours over nine spacewalks, Williams set a new record for the most time spent in spacewalking by a female astronaut.
Leadership Role in Space
Having prior experience on the ISS, both astronauts adapted quickly.
Williams took on the role of station commander three months into their stay and held the position until earlier this month.
Their extended stay provides valuable data for NASA’s research on the effects of long-duration space missions.
The findings will contribute to studies on muscle and bone loss, brain fluid changes, heart disease risks, and psychological impacts—key concerns for future Moon and deep-space missions.

**********[19th March 2025] The Hindu Op-ed: What is happening in Balochistan?
International Relations
PYQ Relevance:
How far are India’s internal security challenges linked with border management particularly in view of the long porous borders with most countries of South Asia and Myanmar?”
(2013)
Reason:
The movement of non-state actors, the potential for cross-border terrorism, and the involvement of external actors in Balochistan could link to India’s internal security challenges and the complexities of managing its own borders.
Mentor’s Comment:
UPSC mains have always focused on the
strategy of
internal security challenges (2013)
‘cross-border terrorist attacks
(2016).
On March 11, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked a train with 400 passengers between Quetta and Sibi, releasing women and children while demanding a prisoner exchange. Pakistan refused and launched a 24-hour military operation, resulting in 21 civilian deaths. Reports suggest higher security losses, followed by further attacks on Pakistani forces across Balochistan.
Today’s editorial discusses the challenges in Pakistan’s Balochistan province and how India can strategically respond. This analysis is relevant for GS Paper 2 (International Relations) and GS Paper 3 (Internal Security).
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Pakistan’s internal politics will shape the unrest in Balochistan. However, due to low trust in the military and government, meaningful talks between insurgents and the leadership seem unlikely.
What are the key reasons behind the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan?
Historical Grievances and Forced Integration (1948):
Many Baloch nationalists argue that Balochistan was forcefully incorporated into Pakistan in 1948 without the consent of its people. Example: Multiple insurgencies have occurred over the decades (1950s, 1960s, 1970s, mid-2000s) due to political and economic marginalization.
Political and Socio-Economic Marginalization:
The region remains underdeveloped despite its vast natural resources (coal, copper, gold, gas). The Baloch people feel excluded from governance and decision-making. Example: Even with rich gas reserves, local communities face power shortages while other provinces benefit from Balochistan’s resources.
Military Suppression and Human Rights Violations:
Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies have employed heavy-handed tactics such as enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and crackdowns on dissent. Example: The mass protests led by Baloch women against custodial killings and forced disappearances highlight the ongoing repression.
China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Resource Exploitation:
Large-scale infrastructure projects, like Gwadar Port, were developed without consulting local communities, causing displacement and demographic changes. Example: Chinese fishing trawlers have disrupted local fishermen’s livelihoods, leading to economic hardships and resentment.
Growing Insurgent Coordination and External Factors:
Various Baloch insurgent groups (BLA, BLF, BRG) have improved their coordination, launching high-profile attacks on security forces and infrastructure. Example: The Baloch Raji Aajoi Sangar (BRAS) alliance has intensified attacks, including the March 2024 train hijacking and past assaults on Chinese workers and security installations.
How has the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) impacted the socio-political landscape of Balochistan?
Economic Disparities and Local Alienation:
Despite promises of economic growth, local Baloch communities have seen minimal benefits from CPEC projects, leading to resentment.
Gwadar Port’s development has largely benefited Chinese and Pakistani investors, while local fishermen face economic hardships due to Chinese deep-sea fishing trawlers.
Increased Security Presence and Military Crackdown:
To safeguard CPEC projects, Pakistan has intensified military operations in Balochistan, leading to human rights abuses and forced displacements.
The establishment of the Special Security Division (SSD) for CPEC has led to increased military checkpoints and reports of enforced disappearances.
Rise in Insurgency and Targeted Attacks:
Baloch insurgent groups view CPEC as a form of exploitation, leading to increased attacks on Chinese nationals and Pakistani security forces.
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has carried out multiple attacks, including the 2022 suicide bombing in Karachi targeting Chinese teachers associated with CPEC projects.
Demographic Changes and Marginalization of Locals:
Large-scale infrastructure projects have led to an influx of outsiders, creating fears among Baloch communities about losing their cultural and economic dominance.
The settlement of non-Baloch workers in Gwadar has fueled protests, with locals demanding control over job opportunities and land rights.
Environmental Degradation and Livelihood Losses:
Industrialization and large-scale construction under CPEC have led to pollution, water shortages, and destruction of marine ecosystems, affecting local livelihoods.
Gwadar’s water crisis has worsened due to excessive resource extraction for CPEC-related industries, forcing residents to rely on water tankers.
How can India leverage this situation to its advantage?
Diplomatic Advocacy for Human Rights:
India can raise concerns over human rights violations in Balochistan at international forums like the UN and human rights organizations, building pressure on Pakistan.
Indian Prime Minister’s 2016 Independence Day speech highlighted Balochistan’s struggles, signaling diplomatic support.
Strategic Engagement with Baloch Leadership:
Engaging with Baloch exiled leaders and activists can strengthen India’s regional influence and counter Pakistan’s narrative on Kashmir.
India has provided a platform to Baloch leaders like Brahumdagh Bugti, who has sought asylum in India.
Intelligence and Strategic Operations:
India can enhance intelligence-sharing and non-conventional tactics to counter threats emanating from Pakistan, especially along its western borders.
Reports suggest Indian agencies have been monitoring CPEC activities and Pakistan’s military actions in Balochistan.
Economic and Cultural Soft Power:
India can support Baloch diaspora communities through scholarships, cultural exchanges, and humanitarian assistance to build goodwill.
Media outlets in India have amplified Baloch issues, increasing global awareness of Pakistan’s suppression.
Countering CPEC’s Strategic Influence:
By highlighting the environmental and economic concerns of Balochistan, India can strengthen its ties with countries skeptical of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
India’s opposition to CPEC, citing sovereignty concerns over PoK, aligns with global criticisms of China’s debt-trap diplomacy, helping form strategic alliances.
Way forward:
International Advocacy and Strategic Alliances:
India should continue raising the Balochistan issue in global forums while strengthening diplomatic ties with nations wary of CPEC and China’s growing influence.
Collaborating with the Quad (US, Japan, Australia) and EU on human rights and regional security concerns.
Balanced Engagement with Baloch Leadership:
India can discreetly support Baloch nationalist movements through political dialogue, humanitarian aid, and economic initiatives, ensuring a calibrated approach without direct intervention.
Facilitating educational opportunities and cultural exchanges for Baloch youth to build long-term goodwill.
**********The dystopian side of Insta-commerce
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Gig Workers related issues;
Why in the News?
Startup founders publicly claimed to support gig workers’ rights but secretly resist laws that would actually protect them.
What is the nature of employment in urban labour chowks and mazdoor mandis?
Daily Wage and Informal Work:
Workers gather at labour chowks every morning, hoping to be hired for the day. Example: Construction workers in Delhi’s Kashmere Gate labour chowk wait for contractors to hire them for masonry or painting jobs.
Highly Competitive and Unstable:
Large numbers of workers compete for limited jobs, often accepting lower wages out of desperation. Example: In Mumbai’s Dadar labour market, carpenters and plumbers rush to secure work before others.
Exploitative Hiring Practices:
Employers and thekedars (middlemen) negotiate wages, often offering the lowest possible rates. Example: In Ahmedabad, daily wage workers in textile markets are hired at rates well below the minimum wage.
Lack of Social Security and Benefits:
No job security, health benefits, or pensions; workers are paid only for the day they work. Example: Brick kiln workers in Hyderabad have no accident coverage despite working in hazardous conditions.
Piece-Rate and Task-Based Payment:
Workers are often paid per unit of work completed rather than a fixed wage. Example: In Chennai’s wholesale vegetable markets, loaders are paid per sack carried rather than for the number of hours worked.
Who benefits the most from the presence of thekedars in the labour market?
Employers Benefit from Lower Labour Costs:
Thekedars help employers negotiate lower wages and better terms by creating a competitive environment among workers. This allows employers to maximize profits by minimizing labor costs. Example: In urban labour chowks, employers can select workers at the lowest possible wage due to the high competition among workers, which benefits the employer financially.
Thekedars Themselves Profit from Commissions:
Thekedars earn commissions or fees from both workers and employers for their services. This financial gain is a direct benefit to them. Example: In the construction industry, thekedars often receive a percentage of the workers’ wages as a commission for facilitating the hiring process.
How do digital platforms replicate the role of thekedars in modern gig work?
Acting as Middlemen Without Responsibility:
Just like thekedars, digital platforms connect workers to employers but do not recognize them as formal employees, avoiding obligations like job security or benefits. Example: Ride-hailing apps like
Uber and Ola
classify drivers as “partners” rather than employees, denying them benefits like PF or health insurance.
Downward Wage Bidding:
Workers must accept the lowest possible payment, as platforms set rates based on demand and supply, just like the daily wage auctions in mazdoor mandis. Example:
Food delivery workers on Swiggy and Zomato
have seen their per-delivery payments decrease over time as competition increases.
Algorithm-Controlled Work Allocation:
Platforms use algorithms to decide which worker gets a task, replacing the manual selection process of thekedars. Workers have no bargaining power over wages or work hours. Example:
Freelancers on Upwork or Fiverr
depend on algorithms that prioritize clients, making workers compete for lower pay.
Lack of Collective Bargaining:
Gig workers are isolated, just like daily wagers in urban labour markets, making unionization and collective bargaining difficult. Example:
Amazon Flex workers
have no union representation and must accept whatever delivery rates the company offers.
Exploitative Rating Systems:
Workers must maintain high ratings to get work, forcing them to accept low wages and poor conditions, similar to how thekedars exploit labour desperation. Example:
“Insta Maids” service
offers house help for ₹49 per hour, making workers compete for ratings instead of fair wages.
What are the challenges for gig workers in India?
Lack of Job Security and Social Benefits:
Gig workers are classified as “independent contractors,” denying them benefits like health insurance, provident fund, and paid leave.
Delivery partners for
receive no compensation if injured while working.
Low and Unstable Earnings:
Payment structures are unpredictable, with fluctuating wages and reduced per-task payouts over time, making financial planning difficult.
drivers often struggle as their earnings depend on peak-hour incentives, which companies frequently revise.
Exploitation Through Rating Systems:
Workers must maintain high ratings to secure jobs, forcing them to accept unreasonable customer demands and work long hours.
Urban Company service providers
risk lower earnings or job loss if they receive poor ratings from customers, regardless of actual service quality.
What steps have been taken by the Indian government?
Code on Social Security, 2020:
This legislation brings gig and platform workers under the ambit of social security schemes for the first time.
The law mandates that gig workers be eligible for benefits like life and disability cover, health and maternity benefits, and old-age protection.
E-Shram Portal (2021):
A national database for unorganized workers, including gig workers, was launched to provide them with targeted benefits.
Registered workers receive a Universal Account Number (UAN) and accident insurance coverage under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana.
State-Level Welfare Initiatives:
Several state governments have taken initiatives to support gig workers.
Rajasthan introduced the
Platform-Based Gig Workers Welfare Board
(2023) to ensure social security benefits.
NITI Aayog Report on Gig Economy (2022):
The report highlights the need for policy interventions, including skill development, financial inclusion, and social security for gig workers.
Recommendations were made to extend benefits like Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and health insurance to gig workers.
PLI Scheme and Skill Development Programs:
The government has introduced skill development programs for gig workers, especially in sectors like logistics and e-commerce.
Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)
helps gig workers upskill and transition into better-paying roles.
Way forward:
Strengthening Legal Protections & Social Security:
Enforce
minimum wages, accident insurance, and pension benefits
for gig and informal workers.
Amend the
mandatory
employer contributions.
Collective Bargaining & Fair Work Standards:
Facilitate
and introduce
fair algorithmic policies
to prevent wage suppression.
Implement
transparent rating and payment systems
on digital platforms like Swiggy and Uber.
Mains PYQ:
Examine the role of ‘Gig Economy’ in the process of empowerment of women in India.
(UPSC 2021)
Reason:
The article explores “insta-commerce,” where gig workers, including women, sell via social media. While the PYQ focuses on empowerment, the article highlights challenges like job insecurity, unfair wages, and the lack of grievance redressal. This perspective offers a nuanced view of the gig economy’s impact, including its dual role in both enabling and potentially disempowering women.
**********Kerala’s drug menace is widespread and escalating
Security Issues
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Drug trafficking;
Why in the News?
Drug abuse in Kerala has increased over the past three years. In March, the Kerala High Court raised concerns about drug mafias, and the Governor met university officials to address student drug problems.
What are the key factors contributing to the surge in drug abuse cases in Kerala over the past three years?
Increased Drug Trafficking via Coastal Routes:
Kerala’s long coastline makes it a transit hub for international drug cartels. Example: In 2023, a Sri Lankan boat carrying 200 kg of heroin was intercepted off the Kerala coast.
Rise of Synthetic & Party Drugs Among Youth:
Increased use of MDMA, LSD, and methamphetamine, particularly in urban areas and college campuses. Example: In 2022, over 1,000 students were caught in possession of synthetic drugs in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram.
Easy Availability Through Darknet & Courier Services:
Online platforms and encrypted messaging apps have facilitated drug trade. Example: In 2024, Kerala police busted a drug network using dark web transactions and fake delivery addresses.
Widespread Consumption Beyond Urban Centers:
Unlike other states, drug abuse is reported in both rural and urban districts. Example: Every district in Kerala recorded at least 500 NDPS cases in 2022, indicating a statewide crisis.
Limited Focus on Major Suppliers & Traffickers:
94% of NDPS cases in Kerala are for possession, with only 6% related to trafficking. Example: While thousands of consumers are arrested, major drug syndicates continue operations largely unchecked.
What is the situation of drug abuse at all India levels?
Steady Rise in NDPS Cases Across India:
Cases under the
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act
have been increasing, though some states show a decline in recent years.
India recorded over
1.5 lakh NDPS cases in 2023
, with a significant rise in Punjab, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu.
Punjab & Northeast Among the Worst-Affected Regions:
Punjab has long struggled with
heroin addiction
, while the Northeast is affected due to drug trafficking from Myanmar’s Golden Triangle.
In 2024, Punjab recorded
30 cases per lakh people
, the second-highest after Kerala.
Shift from Natural to Synthetic & Pharmaceutical Drugs: Synthetic drugs (MDMA, LSD, Meth), opioids, and prescription medicines (Tramadol, Codeine-based syrups)
are increasingly being abused.
In Mumbai, over
60% of drug-related arrests in 2023
involved synthetic drugs rather than traditional narcotics like cannabis.
Growing Use of Dark Web & Digital Payments for Drug Trade: Cryptocurrency transactions, darknet markets, and courier services
are being used for drug sales.
In 2023, the
Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)
dismantled an online drug syndicate operating across multiple Indian states.
State-Wise Variation in Drug Trafficking & Consumption Patterns:
face opioid crises,
Mumbai & Bengaluru
see more party drug use, and
Tamil Nadu & Andhra Pradesh
have rising cannabis-related arrests.
Bengaluru accounted for 63% of Karnataka’s NDPS cases
, highlighting an urban concentration of drug abuse.
What are the steps taken by the Government?
Strengthening Law Enforcement & Anti-Drug Operations:
The
and state police have intensified crackdowns on drug trafficking networks.
In 2023, the NCB seized over
2000 kg of drugs
nationwide, including heroin and synthetic substances, in coordinated raids.
Expansion of Rehabilitation & De-addiction Programs:
Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
runs the
Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyan (NMBA)
to promote awareness and rehabilitation.
Over
370 de-addiction centres
were established under NMBA in states like Punjab, Maharashtra, and Kerala.
Use of Technology & AI for Drug Surveillance:
Government agencies monitor
dark web transactions, cryptocurrency payments, and social media platforms
to track drug deals.
In 2023, the NCB cracked a
crypto-drug syndicate
that was smuggling MDMA and LSD through online orders.
Public Awareness & Educational Campaigns:
Schools, colleges, and workplaces are conducting
anti-drug sensitization programs
to reduce youth drug abuse.
‘Love-a-Thon’ campaign
in universities aims to educate students on the dangers of substance abuse.
International Cooperation & Border Security Measures:
India has increased cooperation with
Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Iran
to curb cross-border drug trafficking.
In 2023, the Indian Navy intercepted a
Pakistan-based heroin shipment
worth ₹1,200 crore in the Arabian Sea.
Way forward:
Targeted Crackdown on Drug Supply Chains:
Strengthen intelligence-led operations against
major traffickers
, enhance
coastal & border security
, and increase
inter-agency coordination
to dismantle drug syndicates.
Comprehensive Prevention & Rehabilitation Strategy:
Expand
school-based drug education
, integrate
mental health support
in de-addiction programs, and enhance
community-based rehabilitation
to address both urban and rural drug abuse.
Mains PYQ:
Explain how narco-terrorism has emerged as a serious threat across the country. Suggest suitable measures to counter narco-terrorism.
(UPSC 2024)
Reason:
This question is potentially linked with narco-terrorism. The measures suggested to counter narco-terrorism would also be relevant to addressing the drug problem in Kerala, especially if it involves organized crime and cross-border elements.

No Ministerial Representation
: No minister can represent the CAG or assume responsibility for their actions.
Issues with the Appointment of the CAG
The current process for appointing the

centralized control
Union government
The CAG is appointed by the
President on the advice of the government
, raising concerns about
potential executive influence
over a key independent body.
Critics argue that this process compromises the
CAG’s independence
and calls for a
neutral selection committee
involving the
Prime Minister
Leader of the Opposition
Chief Justice of India
This would ensure that the CAG is appointed transparently and impartially, free from political interference.
Historically, the
lack of clear guidelines
regarding the CAG’s appointment has allowed executive interference, much like the early years of judicial appointments.
Supreme Court interventions have already reformed appointment processes for bodies like the
Election Commission
Central Vigilance Commission
, and similar reforms for the CAG are necessary to protect its autonomy.

**********Miller-Urey Hypothesis
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
A recent study led by
Stanford University
chemist Richard Zare has introduced a novel perspective on the origins of life on Earth, providing an alternative to the well-known Miller-Urey hypothesis.
About the Miller-Urey Hypothesis
The Miller-Urey hypothesis emerged from an
experiment conducted in 1952
by chemists
Stanley Miller
and
Harold Urey
It sought to simulate the conditions of
early Earth
to understand how life could have originated.
They used a
mixture of water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen
, gases believed to be present in the early Earth’s atmosphere.
The setup also included an
electric spark
to simulate lightning, which they hypothesized could have played a role in the formation of
organic compounds
Results
: The experiment successfully demonstrated that
organic molecules
, like
amino acids
, essential for life, could form when an electrical spark (simulating lightning) was applied to the gas mixture.
Impact and Debate
The experiment was a landmark in understanding life’s chemical origins.
However, over time, critics argued that
real lightning
would have been rare and mostly occurred over
open ocean
, where
would have been quickly dispersed.
This led to the questioning of
lightning as the primary trigger for life’s origins
Life on Earth and the Role of ‘Microlightning’ in Water Droplets
The Stanford study shows that when
water droplets divide
, they develop
opposing electrical charges
—larger droplets become
positively charged
, and smaller droplets become
negatively charged
When these
oppositely charged droplets come close together
tiny sparks
(termed
micro-lightning
) can leap between them, mimicking the electrical phenomena that occur in
thunderstorms
Experimental Evidence
In the experiment, when water sprays were mixed with
nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia
, they produced
glycine
uracil
, similar to those in the
Miller-Urey experiment
from water sprays can therefore generate organic compounds, providing a
plausible and common natural process
for the origin of life.
These
microlightning events
could have been far more common and accessible than
lightning strikes
, offering an
alternative mechanism
for the generation of life-building organic molecules.
