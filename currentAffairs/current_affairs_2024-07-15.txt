WHY IS MILITANCY ON THE RISE IN JAMMU?
Mains – GS 3
On July 8, militants ambushed two Army vehicles in Kathua district, Jammu and Kashmir, killing five soldiers and injuring five others. This was the fifth terror attack in the Jammu division since June 9, resulting in the deaths of eight security personnel and 10 civilians.
The recent attacks suggest a renewed effort to revive militancy in Jammu over the past three years, particularly in the Chenab Valley (Doda, Kishtwar, Ramban, Kathua, Udhampur, Reasi) and south of the Pir Panjal (Rajouri, Poonch).
While Kashmir Valley has long seen terror incidents, the resurgence in Jammu, a region largely free of such violence for two decades, has alarmed the security establishment. This area was a militant hotspot in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
What does the data show?
Since 2021, the Jammu region has witnessed 31 terror incidents in which 47 security forces and 19 civilians have been killed. 48 terrorists were also killed in various encounters.
The Kashmir Valley, meanwhile, reported 263 terror incidents in which 68 security forces and 75 civilians were killed. As many as 417 terrorists have also been killed in the Valley since 2021.
Even though the incidents in Jammu remain far fewer than in the Valley, it is the frequency and the nature of attacks, targeting pilgrims and security forces that is worrying.
What could be the possible reasons?
After the 2020 Galwan clashes in eastern Ladakh, a large contingent of the Army was pulled out of Jammu and deployed along the China border. This led to the thinning of the security grid, making the area vulnerable.
Inimical elements in the neighbourhood want to engage and exhaust India at both the fronts — the western (Pakistan) and northern (China) borders as part of a design, according to experts.
As there is a heightened state of alert in the Kashmir Valley and little leg room for state-sponsored terrorists, it is convenient to launch terror attacks in Jammu where the guard is relatively down.
Post-reading down of Article 370 in J&K in 2019, and based on indicators such as zero stone-throwing events, no strikes, and a boom in tourism, the government has claimed huge success in the Kashmir Valley in terms of the overall security scenario. Reviving terrorism in Jammu upsets this narrative.
The demography of the area is such that the attacks could flare up communal tensions too, leading to social unrest.
How is the infiltration happening?
The 192-km international border (IB) along Jammu is secured by the Border Security Force (BSF) while the 740-km Line of Control (LoC), the effective border in the Kashmir Valley and parts of Jammu, is under the operational control of the Army.
Though measures are in place, tough terrain and forested areas along the LoC and vulnerable patches along the IB may have been used for fresh infiltration.

SALVINIA MOLESTA
Prelims & Mains – ENVIRONMENT
An exotic beetle released into a vast reservoir in Betul district (Madhya Pradesh) has successfully eradicated an invasive weed species, Salvinia molesta, within 18 months.
Cyrtobagus salvinia, the exotic beetle , was imported to India after thorough research and with the necessary governmental approvals. Within 15 to 18 months, its population multiplied significantly, effectively consuming and destroying the weed.
SALVINIA MOLESTA :
Salvinia molesta, commonly known as giant salvinia, or as kariba weed after it infested a large portion of Lake Kariba between Zimbabwe and Zambia, is an aquatic fern, native to south-eastern Brazil.
It is a free-floating plant that does not attach to the soil, but instead remains buoyant on the surface of a body of water.
It thrives in slow-moving, nutrient-rich, warm, freshwater. A rapidly growing competitive plant, it is dispersed long distances within a waterbody (via water currents) and between waterbodies (via animals and contaminated equipment, boats or vehicles).
Salvinia molesta may form dense vegetation mats that reduce water-flow and lower the light and oxygen levels in the water. This stagnant dark environment negatively affects the biodiversity and abundance of freshwater species, including fish and submerged aquatic plants.
Salvinia molesta can alter wetland ecosystems and cause wetland loss and also poses a severe threat to socio-economic activities dependent on open, flowing and/or high quality waterbodies.
It is on the list of the World’s 100 Most Invasive Species.

**********India Could Soon Allow Weight-Loss Drug Tirzepatide
Why in News?
In a first, an expert committee of India’s drug regulator (CDSCO, which is under DCGI) gave the green light to the weight loss drug tirzepatide.
The drug will receive final regulatory approval after this recommendation is reviewed, enabling its maker (US based Eli Lilly) to introduce the product to the Indian market.
What’s in Today’s Article?
The Development of Various Weight Loss Drugs
About Semaglutide and Tirzepatide Drugs
What are Some of the Side Effects/ Limitations of the Zepbound Drug?
The Development of Various Weight Loss Drugs:
The development of various weight loss drugs has been a game changer for obesity treatment in recent years, especially in the
US and Europe
The US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has approved
Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide)
for chronic weight management in adults.
These drugs can be prescribed to those who are
Obese
(with a body mass index [BMI] of over 30), or
Overweight
(with a BMI between 27 and 30), and
Have at least one other health condition
related to their weight (such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes).
About Semaglutide and Tirzepatide Drugs:
Semaglutide and tirzepatide (both are administered as injections under-the-skin) are
polypeptides
- small proteins that boost the levels of naturally-occurring hormones in the body.
These hormones include glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1), which
control weight through the brain and digestive tract.
Higher GLP-1 levels (released in the gut) trigger the sensation of satiety - the feeling of being satisfied and having had enough to eat, in the brain.
These drugs also help manage glucose levels
, making them an effective treatment for diabetes.
While semaglutide only targets GLP-1 receptors,
tirzepatide also boosts a second hormone
: glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).
The GIP also regulates weight through receptors in brain and fat cells, and the combined action of GLP-1 and GIP enhance each other’s effects.
Global trials for Zepbound
(in which Indians took part as well) have yielded promising results.
Based on data from these trials,
Zepbound got regulatory clearance in India
, with a crucial rider to conduct a phase IV (post-marketing surveillance) trial
to scrutinise side effects.
Zepbound is a prescription medicine
and cannot be used for cosmetic weight loss.
According to Eli Lilly,
Zepbound’s most common side effects
include nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, indigestion, injection-site reactions, fatigue, allergic reactions, belching, hair loss, and heartburn.
Eli Lilly specifically highlights the risk of thyroid tumours, including
thyroid cancer
Obesity drugs are
not one-time miraculous treatments
for weight loss and need to be used regularly for their weight loss and other effects to last.
This is because obesity is a complex, chronic and progressive disease which has to be managed throughout one’s life.

**********How is India’s Hunt for Critical Minerals Going?
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background (Context of the Article)
About Critical Minerals (Meaning, Examples, Importance, Reserves, etc.)
’s Policy (Steps Taken by Govt., About Domestic Production, etc.)
Background:
In June, the Ministry of Mines launched the fourth tranche of critical minerals auction, offering 21 blocks across 14 states.
To incentivize exploration, the
ministry announced a scheme to reimburse up to Rs 20 crore in exploration expenses for license holders
License holders can claim up to Rs 20 crore for exploration activities and may receive additional reimbursements if they hand over a block for mining lease within three years.
What are Critical Minerals?
Critical minerals are raw materials essential for economic and national security, often used in
high-tech industries
renewable energy technologies
They are typically rare, difficult to mine and substitute, and often vulnerable to supply chain disruptions due to limited global production and geopolitical factors.
The growing demand for these minerals, driven by technological advancements and the global transition to green energy, underscores their critical importance.
Securing a stable supply of critical minerals is thus a strategic priority for many countries to ensure economic stability and technological progress.
Examples of Critical Minerals:
Lithium:
Used in lithium-ion batteries for EVs, consumer electronics, and energy storage systems.
According to the US Geological Survey (USGS),
Australia
Chile
boast the largest reserves of lithium available in mines around the world today.
Cobalt:
Essential for battery production, aerospace components, and other high-strength alloys.
Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) is by far the largest global supplier of cobalt, possessing almost half of all cobalt reserves in global mines.
Graphite:
Key for batteries, fuel cells, and high-temperature applications.
In 2023,
China
had the world's largest reserves of natural graphite, at approximately 78 million metric tons.
Nickel:
Important for stainless steel production and battery manufacturing.
Indonesia
boast the world’s largest reserves of nickel in global mines today.
Rare Earth Elements (REEs):
Vital for manufacturing electronics, magnets, and military applications.
According to estimates, the total worldwide reserves of rare earths amount to approximately 110 million metric tons.
Most of these reserves are located within China, estimated at some 44 million metric tons.
After China, the major rare earth countries based on reserve volume are Vietnam, Russia, and Brazil.
Critical Minerals Reserves in the World & India:
India does not have reserves of nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, rare earth elements, neodymium and indium, and the country’s requirement of copper and silver are higher than its current reserves.
Significance/Importance of Critical Minerals:
Minerals such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, REEs are essential for the world’s ongoing efforts to switch to greener and cleaner energy.
The International Energy Agency has said that the world’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in the net zero emissions scenario, would translate into very rapid growth in demand for these minerals.
By 2040, the demand for copper is expected to rise 50%, double for nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements, quadruple for graphite and eightfold for lithium, which is crucial for batteries.
In India, the lack of ready reserves of critical minerals has resulted in 100% import dependence for minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel.
Steps Taken by Govt. to Explore These Minerals:
Recognizing the risks of relying on a few countries for mineral supplies, the Indian government amended the
Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957
, to allow mining concessions for 24 critical minerals.
This led to the launch of auctions for 20 mineral blocks, including the lithium block in J&K.
However, initial investor interest was low, resulting in the cancellation of most auctions due to a lack of bidders.
The first successful auctions resulted in six winners for blocks in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh.
The results of subsequent auction rounds are still pending, and a fourth tranche, including 10 re-offered blocks, has been initiated.
Why are some Blocks not Finding Takers?
As per industry experts, the reasons for low interest among miners for some of these blocks include the lack of adequate data on the potential reserves buried within them.
Technology challenges also affect outcomes. For instance, the lithium block in J&K has clay deposits, and the technology for the mineral’s extraction from clay remains untested globally.
When is Domestic Production likely to Begin?
The commercialization of India's domestic mineral blocks is still in
early exploration stages and is unlikely to yield significant benefits by 2030
, according to ICRA.
To mitigate this risk, the Indian government is encouraging exploration and attracting more miners.
Additionally, India is acquiring overseas mineral assets, such as a lithium brine mine in Argentina, through a joint venture called Khanij Bidesh India Limited.
India has also joined the U.S.-led Mineral Security Partnership, which includes major buyers and sellers of critical minerals, to further secure its mineral supply.

**********Bihar govt seeks MSP for makhana
Why in news?
The Bihar government has urged the Centre to declare the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for makhana, an aquatic crop.
The state has also flagged lack of manpower at the Darbhanga (Bihar)-based Indian Council of Agricultural Research — National Research Centre (ICAR-NRC) for Makhana.
What’s in today’s article?
Demand by Bihar Govt
About
Makhanas are also known as fox nuts, Euryale ferox, lotus seeds, gorgon nuts and phool makhana.
Botanical name
- Euryale ferox Salisb
Basically, it is an aquatic crop, belonging to the family of Nympheaceae.
Cultivation
This plant, which is grown commercially, is often found in stagnant water bodies like ponds, swamps, oxbow lakes, ditches, and certain low-lying areas.
It thrives naturally in warm, tropical, and subtropical climates.
Farmers typically sow the seeds in shallow water, and the plants are allowed to grow until they flower and produce seeds.
Harvesting
Harvesting usually occurs during the summer months. The mature seeds are collected from the water, dried in the sun, and then roasted to remove the hard outer shell.
The process of roasting and popping is essential to convert the hard seeds into the light, crunchy, and edible form we recognize as makhana.
Areas where makhana is produced
Makhana plant or Euryale ferox Salisb is a native of South-East Asia and China, but is now distributed and exported to different parts of the world.
In the initial years of commercial production, the plant’s distribution was limited to tropical and sub-tropical regions of South-East and East Asia and other countries.
This includes Japan, Korea, Russia, North America, Nepal, Bangladesh to name a few.
In India, the makhana seeds are distributed in different states including West Bengal, Bihar, Manipur, Tripura, Assam, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Eastern Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
However, the commercial cultivation and processing is limited to North Bihar, Manipur, parts of West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.
Indian States Producing Makhana
Traditionally the Indian state of Bihar has been the hub of makhana cultivation and production.
The focused and major lotus seeds producing districts includes Madhubani, Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Saharsa, Supaul, Araria, Kishanganj, Purnia and Katihar.
It should be noted that 80% of the total production of processed makhana seeds comes from 4 districts of Madhubani, Darbhanga, Purnia and Saharsa.
Out of these districts, Madhubani and Darbhanga lead the production.
Nutritional Value of Makhana
Fox nut has a low Glycemic Index (GI)
It means that is slowly absorbed by the body and does not shoot the sugar level in human beings and is also helpful for people suffering for diabetes.
High Fiber Content
High fiber acts as an absorbent and is helpful for the body ,in heart management, keeping the body fit and fine.
Low in Calories
Fox nuts can be eaten on a daily basis in different forms to regulate normal body functions.
High in Potassium
and also contains Vitamin B1, carotene, iodine, iron, and phosphorous in addition to calcium.
The natural sodium content in phool makhana is insignificant which is also helpful to manage blood pressure.
The ICAR-NRC for Makhana, Darbhanga, was sanctioned by the Department of Agricultural Research & Education.
It was sanctioned as a new scheme during the
IX Five Year Plan period (1997–2002)
for Conservation, Research & Development of the makhana crop.
It started functioning from February 2002.
However, in 2005, the NRC for Makhana was merged and brought under the administrative control of ICAR-Research Complex for Eastern Region (RCER), Patna.
With this move, the national tag of the NRC for Makhana was revoked.
In May 2023, the Central government restored the status of Research Centre for Makhana, Darbhanga to “National Research Centre for Makhana, Darbhanga.
It added other aquatic crops including fish in its mandate.
However, the NRC for Makhana was transferred under the administrative control of the ICAR’s Agricultural Engineering Division and attached to the Ludhiana-based ICAR-Central Institute of Post Harvest Engineering & Technology.
Declare the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for makhana
The Bihar government has urged the Centre to declare the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for makhana.
It has also flagged lack of manpower at the Darbhanga-based Indian Council of Agricultural Research — National Research Centre (ICAR-NRC) for Makhana and told the Centre it was in bad shape.
Bihar – hub of makhana production
About 85 per cent of the country’s makhana production comes from Bihar.
About 10 lakh people are directly or indirectly involved in its cultivation and production process.
Most of the farmers who cultivate the GI-tagged makhana — in Darbhanga, Saharsa, Madhepura, Supaul, Purnia, Katihar, Araria, Kishanganj, Madhubani and Sitamarhi districts of the state — come from poor backgrounds.
Darbhanga-based ICAR-NRC in bad shape
The Darbhanga-based ICAR-NRC for Makhana has only 10 employees against a sanctioned strength of 42.
There’s no administrative staff and a full-time director was never appointed.
Bihar govt has emphasized that the ICAR-NRC for Makhana in Darbhanga needs to be upgraded,
and its administrative headquarters should be moved to Patna

Mains level:
Functions and Powers of CBI;
Why in the News?
The
Supreme Court
upheld the West Bengal government’s suit, which accuses the Union government of
“Constitutional overreach
” by using the
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
to register and investigate cases in the state, despite the state’s withdrawal of general consent on November 16, 2018.
Background
In November 2018, the West Bengal government withdrew its “general consent” that allowed the CBI to conduct investigations within the state.
However, the CBI continued to register FIRs and conduct investigations in West Bengal, leading the state government to file an original suit in the Supreme Court under
Article 131
of the Constitution.
The suit accused the Union government of “constitutional overreach” by allowing the CBI to operate in West Bengal despite the withdrawal of general consent.
Key highlights of the verdict:
Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta argued the CBI’s independence from the Union government, but the Supreme Court pointed to the DSPE Act’s provisions.
It highlighted the Act’s requirement for Central government control over CBI’s establishment and administration, except for cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, which the CVC oversees.
Is the CBI an Independent Agency or Under Union Government Control?
ruled that the
not entirely independent.
The CBI is constituted, administered, and has its powers extended under the
The central government exercises superintendence over the CBI, particularly for offenses other than those under the
, where the Central Vigilance Commission has superintendence.
Therefore, the Union government is vitally concerned with the CBI’s functions and operations.
Does the CBI Need the State’s Permission to Carry Out Investigations in Its Territory?
The CBI derives its powers from the DSPE Act, of 1946.
According to
Section 6
of this Act,
the CBI requires the state government’s consent
to extend its investigation beyond the Union Territories.
The Supreme Court
has ruled that although the CBI is under the administrative control and superintendence of the Union government, this does not negate the requirement of state consent for investigations as per the DSPE Act.
There are
two types of consent – General consent and Specific consent
When a state gives general consent, the CBI does not need to seek permission for every case.
However, if the general consent is withdrawn, the CBI needs to seek specific case-by-case consent from the state.
Several opposition-ruled states have withdrawn their general consent for CBI investigations, which has hampered the CBI’s ability
to freely investigate cases of corruption
involving central government employees in those states.
The states that have withdrawn are-
Mizoram, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and then states of Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Kerala, and Jharkhand
(2020).
Telangana, Tamil Nadu,
Meghalaya
withdrew general consent in 2022.
However, the withdrawal of general consent does not affect pending CBI investigations or cases where a court has ordered a CBI probe. The CBI can also approach a local court to obtain a search warrant to conduct investigations in states that have withdrawn consent.
Note:
In total, 10 states have withdrawn general consent to the CBI as of 2022. This has significantly limited the CBI’s ability to freely investigate cases in these states without seeking prior permission.
Way Forward:
Strengthening Federal Cooperation:
Establish a clear institutional framework that promotes cooperation and coordination between the central and state governments regarding CBI investigations.
Legal and Administrative Reforms:
Consider amending the DSPE Act to provide more clarity on the roles and powers of the CBI and the requirements for state consent.
Jurisdictional Overview and Federal Character
The CBI operates within the context of India’s federal structure, which grants states certain powers and autonomy. The need for state consent limits the CBI’s jurisdiction, as it cannot conduct investigations in states without their general consent.
Powers and Jurisdiction of CBI
Offenses against Central Government Employees
: The CBI has jurisdiction to investigate crimes committed against employees of the central government, such as bribery, corruption, or misconduct cases involving central government officials.
Interstate and International Cases
: The CBI can investigate cases that have inter-state or international ramifications, including organized crime, terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering, and other offenses that require a nationwide or global perspective.
Specific Offences Listed in the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act:
The CBI can investigate offenses specified in the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, including offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, crimes related to the violation of certain central laws, and cases referred to the CBI by the courts or the central government.
Mains PYQ:

**********The SC ruling on the portrayal of disability in films 
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Disability rights
Mains level:
Effectiveness of Disability law
Why in the News?
On July 8, the Supreme Court issued guidelines against stereotyping and discriminating persons with disabilities in visual media, prompted by a plea to ban Aaankh Micholi.
Background:
The Supreme Court’s guidelines came in response to a plea filed by activist Nipun Malhotra challenging the alleged insensitive portrayal of differently-abled individuals in the Film ‘Aaankh Micholi’.
The petitioner argued that the film contained derogatory references and stereotyping of persons with disabilities.
Key Highlights of the Supreme Court Ruling:
Avoiding Derogatory Language:
The court asked creators to avoid words like “cripple”, “spastic”, “afflicted”, “suffering”, and “victim” as they contribute to negative self-image and perpetuate discriminatory attitudes.
Accurate Representation:
The court said stereotyping differently-abled persons in visual media and films must end, and creators should provide an accurate representation of disabilities rather than mocking or mythifying them.
Involvement of Persons with Disabilities:
The court asked creators to practice the principle of “nothing about us, without us” and involve persons with disabilities in the creation and assessment of visual media content.
Training and Collaboration:
The court emphasized the need for training programs for writers, directors, producers, and actors to sensitize them on the impact of portrayals on public perceptions.
What are the laws which grant disability rights?
Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (RPwD Act), 2016:
This is the primary legislation that comprehensively addresses the rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities in India. It replaced the earlier
Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, of 1995.
The National Trust Act, 1999:
It provides legal support to persons with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and multiple disabilities. It focuses on enabling guardianship and providing support to those who may not have guardians.
Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992:
Regulates the training of rehabilitation professionals and promotes research in rehabilitation and special education.
Mental Healthcare Act, 2017:
While primarily focusing on mental health issues, this Act also includes provisions related to the rights and treatment of persons with mental disabilities.
Are the laws governing the ‘Rights of Differently-abled’ persons being implemented properly?
Implementation Gaps:
There are significant gaps between the provisions laid out in laws like the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016
, and their actual implementation on the ground. Many disabled persons continue to face barriers to accessing their entitlements and rights.
Awareness and Sensitization:
There is a lack of awareness among the general public, as well as within government bodies and institutions, about the rights and needs of persons with disabilities.
Infrastructure and Accessibility:
Despite legal mandates for accessibility in public places, transportation, and buildings, implementation remains uneven.
Employment Opportunities:
While laws mandate employment quotas for persons with disabilities in government and private sectors, these quotas are often not met.
What is the way forward?
Enhanced Monitoring and Accountability:
Implement regular audits and monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance with disability rights laws at all levels of governance and across sectors.
Need to Increase Awareness and Sensitization:
Launch nationwide awareness campaigns targeting both the general public and stakeholders within government and private sectors to promote understanding of disability rights.
Mains PYQ:
The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 remains only a legal document without intense sensitisation of government functionaries and citizens regarding disability. Comment.

**********The Yuan Challenge: How India-Russia trade gap may threaten rupee internationalization efforts    
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
India-Russia Bilateral Ties;
Mains level:
Benefits of Internationalization of the Rupee;
Why in the News?
New Delhi aims to boost trade with Moscow to $100 billion by 2030, but India faces a $57 billion trade deficit due to strong oil imports from Russia.
Background
India’s trade with Russia has been skewed since the onset of the Ukraine war in 2022. Russia has become India’s top oil supplier, while Indian exports to Russia have struggled, resulting in a large trade deficit.
The trade deficit in the bilateral trade stood at $57 billion in FY24, with a total trade value of $66 billion. This deficit is primarily driven by India’s significant oil imports from Russia.
Why is the widening trade gap with Russia benefiting the Yuan?
Increase in Balanced Trade with China:
Unlike India, China has been able to maintain a more balanced trade relationship with Russia since the Ukraine war began in 2022.
China’s exports to Russia have surged, with shipments increasing by 47% year-on-year to $111 billion in 2023.
95% of trade between China and Russia is conducted in domestic currencies, making the yuan the most popular currency in the Russian stock market.
Increase in volatility of Rubble and Rupee:
Unlike the yuan, both the Indian rupee and Russian ruble have experienced considerable volatility, complicating trade in domestic currency.
The yuan’s relative stability compared to the rupee and ruble has made it a more attractive currency for settling Russia-India trade
Reluctance of Private Banks:
The Indian private banks have been reluctant to facilitate trade with Russia due to fears of Western sanctions.
Most Indian private banks have significant business interests in Western countries and fear their branches could face sanctions if they engage with Russia.
As Russia prefers the yuan for payments, India’s limited exports to Russia have hindered the use of the rupee in bilateral trade.
What are the benefits of the Internationalisation of the Rupee?
Reduced Dependence on USD:
Internationalizing the rupee would reduce India’s reliance on foreign currencies like the US dollar for international trade and financial transactions.
This would enhance India’s economic sovereignty and reduce exposure to currency fluctuations.
Enhanced Trade Efficiency:
Using the rupee for international transactions can simplify trade processes and reduce transaction costs.
Internationalization of the rupee would eliminate the need for currency conversions, reducing transaction costs and simplifying cross-border trade.
Mitigating Risks:
Protection from currency volatility not only reduces the cost of doing business but also enables better growth of business, improving the chances for Indian businesses to grow globally
Increased Global Influence:
A widely accepted rupee would boost India’s economic and political influence on the global stage.
How can India internationalize the rupee?
The Reserve Bank of India permitted settling trade using the rupee through its circular in July 2022.
Trade invoicing:
For the rupee to be recognized as an international currency, it needs to be increasingly used for trade invoicing.
refers to the process of issuing invoices for goods or services exchanged between international trading partners. It includes detailing the terms of sale, such as prices, quantities, payment terms, and currencies used for settlement.
Increase Rupee Turnover:
The rupee needs to achieve a global forex turnover share of around 4% to be regarded as an international currency, up from the current 1.6%.
Government Support:
Strengthening industrial cooperation and addressing banking sector concerns can promote the use of the rupee.
Challenges involved:
Banking Sector Reluctance:
Private banks are hesitant to facilitate trade with Russia due to fear of Western sanctions.
Rupee Settlement Mechanism:
Indian exporters face difficulties using the rupee settlement mechanism due to the absence of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for banks.
Note:
A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for banks is a formal document outlining step-by-step instructions for routine processes and activities to ensure consistency and compliance.
Currency Volatility:
Both the ruble and the rupee have experienced considerable volatility, complicating trade in domestic currencies.
International Sanctions:
Private banks’ significant business interests in Western countries make them wary of facilitating trade with Russia.
How are Russia and India planning to boost trade?
Both countries have decided
to eliminate non-tariff and tariff barriers in trade
Negotiations for a trade deal with the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) could ease the flow of Indian products into the EEU.
Cooperation in manufacturing sectors
like transport engineering, metallurgy, and chemicals.
Implementation of joint projects in priority areas and expanding reciprocal trade flows of industrial products.
Discussions on a
Migration and Mobility partnership agreement
to facilitate trade and movement between the two countries.
Way Forward
Enhanced Banking Support and Infrastructure:
Develop a robust Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for banks to facilitate smoother implementation of the rupee settlement mechanism for trade with Russia.
Strategic Economic Diplomacy:
Strengthen bilateral economic ties through high-level diplomatic engagements to mitigate banking sector reluctance and enhance trust between Indian and Russian financial institutions.
Mains PYQ:
Craze for gold in Indian has led to surge in import of gold in recent years and put pressure on balance of payments and external value of rupee. In view of this, examine the merits of Gold Monetization scheme.

Definition
Neutrinos, often referred to as “ghost particles,” are subatomic particles with nearly zero mass and no electric charge.
Detection Challenge
They traverse through matter with minimal interaction, making their detection extremely challenging.
Mass
Previously believed to be massless, evidence indicates that neutrinos possess a very small mass.
Abundance
Neutrinos are among the most abundant particles in the universe.
Behaviour
Similar to electrons in terms of nuclear forces; both participate in weak nuclear interactions but not in strong nuclear interactions.
Production
Produced during nuclear fusion in stars (e.g., the Sun) and nuclear fission in reactors.
Properties
Electric Charge
: Electrically Neutral
: Extremely Low (Exact Masses Not Known)
Types
: Electron Neutrino, Muon Neutrino, Tau Neutrino
Interaction
: Weak Interaction
