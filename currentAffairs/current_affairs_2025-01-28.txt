**********Fentanyl
Recently, the US President Donald Trump said his administration was discussing a 10% punitive duty on Chinese imports as fentanyl is being sent from China to the US via Mexico and Canada.
About Fentanyl:
It is a potent
synthetic opioid drug
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as an
analgesic (for pain relief) and anesthetic (for surgery).
It is approximately 100 times more potent than
morphine
and 50 times more potent than
heroin
as an analgesic.
Its overdoses can cause
stupor, changes in pupil size, clammy skin, cyanosis
(blue skin),
coma and respiratory failure leading to death
What are Opioids?
These are a class of drugs that
derive from, or mimic, natural substances
found in the opium poppy plant.
Impacts on human body:
They activate an
area of nerve cells
in the brain and body called
opioid receptors
that block pain signals between the brain and the body.
They produce a variety of effects, including
pain relief and euphoria
and are highly addictive.
Some common opioids include
oxycodone, morphine, codeine, heroin and fentanyl.
An opioid overdose can be identified by a combination of three signs and symptoms:
pinpoint pupils, unconsciousness and difficulties with breathing
Their overuse
can lead to death
due to the effects of opioids on the part of the brain which regulates breathing.

**********Getting Drunk, on Homoeopathy
Context
A recent judgment of the Supreme Court of India
in Bhagwati Medical Hall vs Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation
has
reignited debate on a pressing public health issue: the regulation of alcoholic tinctures
marketed as homeopathic remedies.
The
judgment highlights the complex regulatory architecture
, economic implications, and public health hazards associated with these products.
Despite sporadic attempts to address the issue,
regulatory hurdles and industry resistance have left state governments grappling with an impossible challenge.
The Complexity of Regulatory Framework Governing Alcoholic Tinctures in India
Constitutional Provisions and Division of Powers
governance of alcoholic tinctures is shaped by multiple entries in the Constitution's Seventh Schedule
, which allocates legislative authority between the Union and state governments.
According to
Schedule VII, states have the exclusive power to legislate on public health
and the taxation of alcohol under List II (State List).
This
makes states the primary authority responsible for public health measures
and alcohol-related laws within their territories.
However,
an exception exists: alcohol meant for medicinal purposes falls under Entry 84 of List I (Union List)
, granting the Union government the authority to regulate its taxation.
This constitutional
division creates a regulatory grey area.
While the states are tasked with ensuring public health, they have limited powers to regulate medicinal alcohol
due to the Union’s jurisdiction over its taxation and standards.
dual control creates a situation where neither authority can fully address the issue.
Concurrent Jurisdiction Over Drugs
Drugs, including homeopathic products, fall under the
Concurrent List (List III),
which allows
both the Union and state governments to legislate.
the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, a central legislation, lays down the quality standards for homeopathic drugs
, including alcoholic tinctures.
Act prevents states from unilaterally amending provisions
or introducing stricter regulations without presidential assent.
As a result, states have limited scope to address local public health
concerns arising from the
misuse of these tinctures.
Quality Regulation and Taxation Loopholes
regulatory complexity has allowed manufacturers
of homeopathic alcoholic tinctures to
largely escape oversight.
Unlike alcoholic beverages, which are subject to rigorous quality checks and taxation by state excise departments,
these tinctures operate under the more lenient framework of medicinal alcohol.
Manufacturers have exploited these loopholes
to produce and market tinctures with
alcohol content as high as 12%,
which is legally permissible under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.
In contrast,
popular alcoholic beverages such as ‘strong beer’ contain only 7% alcohol by volume.
disparity not only makes tinctures an attractive alternative for those seeking intoxication but also undermines the efforts of state governments
to regulate alcohol consumption.
Challenges in Regulating Alcoholic Tinctures
Industry Lawfare
Efforts to regulate alcoholic tinctures have been
consistently thwarted by the homeopathic industry's aggressive legal strategies.
After the Union government introduced Rule 106B to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 in 1994—capping the alcohol content at 12% and limiting retail bottle sizes—
the industry mounted a legal challenge.
Over two decades, these lawsuits questioned the rule's constitutionality
, its scientific basis, and procedural lapses in its enactment.
Regulatory Hurdles and Systematic Inefficiencies
Although
the Supreme Court and multiple High Courts upheld the rule
, subsequent litigation targeted technical flaws, such as the failure to table the rule in Parliament.
Despite the simplicity of resolving this issue
, placing the rule before Parliament for 30 days, the Union
government chose prolonged litigation delaying enforcement.
By 2017, the Supreme Court consolidated these cases
, but the matter remains unresolved.
These delays highlight systemic inefficiencies
that jeopardize public health.
Broader Implications of
Revenue Concerns
Revenue losses arise when consumers opt for these low-tax tinctures
over higher-taxed alcoholic beverages.
More alarmingly,
states like Gujarat and Bihar, which prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages, report fatalities linked to the consumption of spurious homeopathic tinctures.
Such incidents undermine state-level alcohol prohibition policies,
creating a public health crisis.
Health Concerns
Unsuspecting consumers
, often unaware of the alcohol content in these tinctures,
may develop severe conditions like alcoholic hepatitis.
Doctors have observed a worrying trend of patients exhibiting symptoms typically associated with chronic alcohol consumption
after using these so-called remedies.
The industry's labelling and marketing practices do little to inform consumers of the potential harm.
The Way Forward
Comprehensive Overhaul of Laws Governing Medicinal Alcohol
The persistent legal battles and regulatory inertia underscore
the need for a comprehensive overhaul of laws governing medicinal alcohol.
Union government must prioritise the public health implications of alcoholic tinctures
, especially as other countries consider mandatory cancer warnings on alcoholic beverages.
Beyond addressing taxation disparities,
it is essential to scrutinise the use of alcohol in traditional medicine systems like homeopathy and Ayurveda.
Striking a Balance
At a time when the efficacy of these remedies is increasingly questioned,
allowing them to cause harm is unacceptable.
Policymakers must strike a balance between respecting cultural practices and safeguarding public health.
Regulatory clarity, scientific evaluation, and robust enforcement mechanisms are imperative to curbing the misuse of alcoholic tinctures.
Conclusion
The regulation of alcoholic tinctures in India exemplifies
the challenges of
balancing federalism, public health, and industry interests.
Supreme Court's judgment
in the Bhagwati Medical Hall case
serves as a reminder of the urgent need for coordinated action.
Addressing this issue requires not only legal reforms but also a paradigm shift
in how public health and consumer protection are prioritized in policymaking.

**********The Union Budget as a Turning Point for Climate Action
Context
Union Budget 2026 presents a critical juncture for India
as it grapples with the dual challenge of
climate change and economic resilience.
With just five years remaining to achieve the first interim Net-Zero target,
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman must navigate an intricate balancing act
—addressing the urgency of climate adaptation and mitigation while ensuring economic growth.
Budget can catalyse transformative policy measures that can safeguard vulnerable communities, boost India’s global competitiveness
, and accelerate progress toward sustainable development.
India’s Progress in Climate Action
PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana
This flagship initiative
aims to promote solar energy adoption in residential households,
enhancing energy access while reducing carbon footprints.
Over 1.45 crore households have registered under this scheme
, showcasing strong public interest.
National Green Hydrogen Mission
With an increased budgetary allocation,
this initiative seeks to position India as a global hub for green hydrogen production.
This is a critical step toward decarbonizing industries like steel, cement, and transportation.
Viability Gap Funding for Offshore Wind Energy
The government’s support for offshore wind energy projects
reflects its ambition to diversify renewable energy sources.
Offshore wind energy holds significant potential for reducing dependency on fossil fuels and achieving long-term energy security.
Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure Support
By investing in EV charging infrastructure,
India is addressing one of the key barriers to EV adoption, range anxiety.
initiative is pivotal to reducing emissions from the transport sector
, which accounts for a significant portion of urban pollution.
Remaining Gaps in India’s Climate Action Plan
Renewable Energy Capacity Gap
India’s installed renewable energy capacity
stands at 203.18 GW, significantly short of the 500 GW target set for 2030.
Bridging this gap requires unprecedented levels of investment, improved policy frameworks, and streamlined execution.
Implementation Challenges in Solar Energy
The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana
highlights the disparity between policy intent and execution.
While registrations for the scheme have crossed 1.45 crore households,
the actual completion rate remains dismal, with only 6.34 lakh installations (4.37%).
points to systemic issues such as bureaucratic inefficiencies
, funding shortages, and a lack of robust monitoring mechanisms.
Dependence on Imports for Solar Modules
India’s solar manufacturing ecosystem remains underdeveloped,
fulfilling only 40% of domestic demand.
reliance on imports makes renewable energy projects more expensive
and vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions.
Additionally,
domestically manufactured solar panels cost 65% more than imported alternatives,
discouraging their adoption.
Underutilised Potential in Railways
India’s vast railway network, which includes extensive land banks and track corridors,
offers untapped opportunities for renewable energy generation.
Estimates suggest
the network could host up to 5 GW of solar and wind installations
, yet this
potential remains largely unexplored
due to a lack of targeted public-private partnerships and investment incentives.
Lack of Comprehensive Fiscal and Policy Measures
Existing fiscal incentives and subsidies often fall short of addressing critical barriers
to renewable energy adoption.
For instance,
the high upfront costs associated with solar installations deter low-income households
, despite the availability of schemes like the Renewal Energy Service Company (RESCO) model.
Comprehensive measures to reduce these costs and increase affordability are urgently needed.
Expectations from Union Budget 2026 Pertaining to Transformative Policy Measures
Adapting to International Market Dynamics
India’s export sector faces a looming challenge with the
European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), set to take effect in 2026.
This measure, imposing carbon levies on imports,
could impact India’s exports to the EU, valued at $8.22 billion annually.
implications for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), contributing 30% of GDP and 45% of exports, are profound.
To mitigate this,
the Budget should establish a dedicated ‘Climate Action Fund’ modelled on Japan’s Green Transformation Fund.
fund can support industrial decarbonisation in vulnerable sectors and build MSME capacity to comply with CBAM regulations
, ensuring export competitiveness.
Transitioning to a Circular Economy
The adoption of a circular economy
offers India significant economic and environmental benefits.
A recent study estimates a
potential profit of ₹40 lakh crore annually by 2050 and a 44% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
FY26 Budget should incentivize investments in recycling and refurbishment technologies by offering a weighted deduction of 150%
and accelerated depreciation benefits.
Strengthening Climate Resilience and Green Finance
India’s vulnerability to climate change
necessitates urgent measures to enhance resilience
Alarmingly,
insurance penetration has declined to 3.7% in FY24, highlighting the need for innovative solutions.
Tax
deductions for climate-linked insurance policies
and reduced GST rates on disaster protection premiums
could encourage broader adoption.
Simultaneously,
the Budget should prioritize standardising green finance definitions, building investor confidence,
and securing a share of the ₹162.5 trillion required to meet India’s climate goals by 2030.
Enhancing RESCO Support and Expanding PLIs for Solar Manufacturing
By transforming prohibitive upfront costs into manageable operating expenses through innovative financial instruments and credit guarantees,
the government can make renewable energy more accessible to low-income households.
Production-linked incentives
across the entire solar module supply chain
can reduce the cost of domestically produced panels and build economies of scale.
This would not only boost India’s manufacturing capacity but also reduce its reliance on imports.
The Importance of Climate-Linked Policies
Climate-linked economic policies are no longer peripheral concerns
but central to maintaining India’s competitiveness in global trade and investment.
rising demand for low-carbon goods and the growing alignment of capital markets with sustainability
metrics
necessitate decisive action.
Integrating climate competitiveness into India’s fiscal framework is imperative to secure its position in an evolving global economy.
Conclusion
The Union Budget 2026 represents a pivotal opportunity
for India to
align its fiscal priorities with its climate commitments.
addressing implementation gaps in renewable energy, safeguarding export competitiveness, creating a circular economy
, and strengthening climate resilience,
the government can pave the way for a sustainable and prosperous future.
Budget will be a litmus test of India’s seriousness in integrating climate action into its economic strategy,
reflecting the nation’s readiness to lead in a low-carbon global economy.

Editorial Analysis
**********The Eighth Wonder of Economic Growth - Understanding the Nuances of Sustainability
Context:
Albert Einstein’s analogy of compound interest as the “eighth wonder of the world” applies aptly to economic growth.
India’s long-term growth potential is immense, with a projected GDP per capita increase from $2,650 to $10,000 by 2045 at a 6% real growth rate.
Even a slightly lower growth rate of 5.5% can achieve the same target, albeit by 2047. The key lies in sustainable, low-risk growth over extended periods.
Key Challenges to India’s Economic Growth:
Debt-fueled growth and rising household indebtedness:
Changing borrowing patterns:
Unlike earlier generations, modern households borrow not just for emergencies or appreciating assets but increasingly for depreciating assets and experiences.
Click-driven EMIs:
The proliferation of e-commerce and the ease of borrowing through digital platforms have
encouraged debt-led consumption
. While this boosts short-term growth, it shifts the burden to the future.
Impact on consumption and growth:
Rising household debt and increasing retail non-performing assets (NPAs) necessitate measures to slow personal loan growth, ensuring more sustainable consumption patterns.
Need for conscious choices:
Encouraging cash-down purchases through better pricing over EMIs can promote financial discipline, akin to the lessons of the marshmallow test, which emphasizes delayed gratification.
Competitive pressure from China:
China’s manufacturing dominance:
Despite the
China+1 strategy
, India faces stiff competition due to China’s strong manufacturing base, policy support, and surplus capacity.
Weak domestic demand in China has led to export price deflation, complicating matters for Indian exporters.
India’s gradual progress:
While India has the potential to increase its manufacturing share, achieving competitiveness requires sustained effort and investment.
Global and domestic economic headwinds:
Rising US interest rates:
Higher US rates and a strong dollar have reduced the yield gap between India and the US, impacting foreign investments.
Decline in net FDI:
Sales of stakes by multinational corporations in Indian arms, driven by valuations rather than pessimism, have contributed to the fall in foreign direct investment.
Stock market overvaluation:
The enthusiasm for small and mid-cap stocks, fueled by post-Covid recoveries and new retail investors, may lead to overvaluation risks.
Investors should heed the principle of “reversion to the mean” for long-term stability.
Strategies for Sustainable Growth:
Disciplined borrowing practices:
Regulating personal loans and promoting conscious financial decisions can build a more resilient economy.
Boosting manufacturing competitiveness:
Long-term policies, investments in infrastructure, and skill development are essential for India to compete with China’s manufacturing prowess.
Cautious investment approach:
Educating new retail investors about market cycles and avoiding speculative tendencies in IPOs and mid-cap investments will foster stability.
Policy and structural support:
The government’s proactive role in supporting manufacturing, tackling inflation, and encouraging foreign investments will be critical.
Conclusion - The Path to $10,000 Per Capita GDP:
India’s journey to achieving a GDP per capita of $10,000 is plausible with sustainable growth strategies.
However, this requires addressing challenges like debt-fueled consumption, global competition, and market exuberance.
By fostering
financial discipline, bolstering manufacturing
, and adopting a cautious investment approach, India can ensure long-term economic resilience and prosperity.

Despite the Union Government’s efforts to address the issue, the strong influence of the homoeopathic industry has often led to legal battles that prevent real progress.
Today’s editorial discusses the difficult challenge state governments face in managing the health risks from alcoholic tinctures sold as homoeopathic medicines in India. This information can be useful for supporting your argument in GS Paper 1 and 2 answers.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Alcoholic tinctures sold as homoeopathic remedies in India pose a serious risk to public health.
What are the recent changes in
homoeopathic tinctures?
Introduction of Rule 106B:
Limits alcohol content in homoeopathic tinctures to
12%
and restricts retail sale to
30 ml bottles
, with larger bottles (up to
100 ml
) allowed only for hospitals.
Taxation Post-GST:
Alcohol for medicinal purposes is taxed at
18%
, significantly lower than State taxes on alcoholic beverages, making tinctures a cheaper alternative.
Supreme Court’s Intervention:
In the
Bhagwati Medical Hall case
, the SC upheld that only the
Union government
can regulate homoeopathic tinctures, emphasizing stricter enforcement to address public health risks.
What are the implications of the recent regulatory changes in homoeopathy?
Regulatory Complexity and Taxation Issues:
regulatory architecture
for homoeopathic alcoholic tinctures is highly complex, with overlapping jurisdictions between the Union and States.
Post-GST, alcohol for medicinal purposes is taxed at
on alcoholic beverages, making homoeopathic tinctures a cheaper alternative for consumers.
States cannot regulate these tinctures without
presidential assent
, leading to a lack of quality control and public health oversight.
Public Health Hazards:
Homoeopathic tinctures containing
12% alcohol
are often consumed as substitutes for alcoholic beverages, leading to
alcohol-related illnesses
such as alcoholic hepatitis.
For example: States like
Gujarat and Bihar
, where alcohol is prohibited, have reported deaths due to the consumption of spurious homoeopathic tinctures..
Industry Lawfare and Regulatory Delays:
The homoeopathic industry has consistently challenged regulations, such as
of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, through prolonged litigation.
The Union government’s decision to pursue litigation instead of laying Rule 106B before Parliament has further delayed regulatory enforcement.
How does the public perception of homoeopathy impact healthcare choices?
Misleading Perception of Safety:
Many consumers perceive homoeopathic remedies as
safe and natural
, unaware of the high alcohol content in tinctures.
This perception leads to the
misuse
of homoeopathic tinctures as substitutes for alcoholic beverages, especially in prohibition States like
Bihar and Gujarat.
Lack of Awareness:
Poorly informed consumers may consume homoeopathic tinctures daily, believing they are curing ailments, while unknowingly risking
alcohol-related diseases
The absence of clear labelling and warnings exacerbates the problem, as consumers are not fully aware of the
associated with these products.
Impact on Healthcare Choices:
The availability of cheap, alcohol-based homoeopathic tinctures influences healthcare choices, particularly among low-income groups seeking affordable alternatives to conventional medicine.
This reliance on homoeopathy can delay or prevent access to
evidence-based medical treatments
, worsening health outcomes.
What role should evidence-based research play in validating homoeopathic practices? (Way forward)
Need for Regulatory Reforms:
Research should inform regulatory decisions, such as whether alcohol should be permitted in homoeopathic and ayurvedic products.
Countries like the U.S. and U.K. are considering
cancer warnings
on alcoholic beverages, highlighting the need for similar scrutiny of alcohol-based medicinal products in India.
Public Health Policy:
Evidence-based research can guide public health policies, ensuring that regulations prioritize
consumer safety
over industry interests.
Research should also address the
of homoeopathic tinctures as substitutes for alcoholic beverages, particularly in prohibition States.
**********Should Governors be Chancellors of State Universities?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Role of Governor;
Why in the News?
The Governor’s role as Chancellor of State universities has been a topic of significant debate. It is frequently misinterpreted as a post-independence mechanism designed to protect universities from political interference.
What are the implications of having the Governor serve as Chancellor for university autonomy?
Reduced Autonomy:
The role of the Governor as chancellor has historically restricted the autonomy of universities, as this model was inherited from colonial rule. The powers granted to Governors include appointing Vice-Chancellors and presiding over university bodies, which can lead to political interference rather than safeguarding academic independence.
Political Interference:
Instead of insulating universities from politics, the involvement of Governors often exacerbates political influence, particularly when Governors act in alignment with the Central government’s agenda, compromising the universities’ operational independence and academic freedom.
Dual Authority System:
The existence of both the Governor and State governments creates a dual authority that can lead to conflicting directives and administrative paralysis, particularly in Opposition-ruled states where disagreements may delay critical decisions such as Vice-Chancellor appointments.
How does the role of Governors as Chancellors align with or contradict the principles of federalism?
Concurrent Legislative Powers in Education (Entry 25, List III, Seventh Schedule):
Since education falls under the Concurrent List, the Governor’s role as Chancellor facilitates coordination between state and national education policies, promoting synergy.
Governor Acting Beyond State Government’s Advice (Article 163):
When Governors act in their discretionary capacity as Chancellors bypassing the elected state government undermines democratic accountability and state autonomy.
State Authority over Universities (Entry 32, List II, Seventh Schedule):
Control over universities is a state subject, and direct interference by Governors in university administration contradicts the federal principle of centralising authority.
What is the role of the President vs Governors as Chancellors?
President:
As the constitutional head, the functions are based on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers at the Union level under
Article 74
of the Constitution. The President does not directly act as a Chancellor for any educational institution.
Governor:
The Governor, appointed by the President under
Article 155
, acts as the constitutional head of the state and also serves as the Chancellor of State universities as per state laws, often with discretionary powers. This dual role blurs the line between their constitutional duties and state governance.
What alternative models for university governance could be considered?
Governor as Ceremonial Chancellor:
This model would limit the Governor’s powers, requiring them to act on the advice of the State Council of Ministers in university matters. States like Gujarat, Karnataka, and Maharashtra have implemented variations of this approach.
Chief Minister as Chancellor:
This model proposes that the Chief Minister take on a ceremonial role. While West Bengal and Punjab have passed bills for this system, they await Presidential assent.
State-Appointed Chancellor:
Implemented in Telangana, this model allows state governments to appoint a ceremonial Chancellor who is an eminent academic or public figure, thus ensuring greater alignment with local governance and accountability.
Chancellor Elected by University Bodies:
Similar to models in prestigious institutions like Oxford and Cambridge, this approach empowers university bodies and alumni to elect their Chancellor, promoting institutional self-governance and reducing political influence.
Chancellor Appointed by University’s Executive Council:
This model involves universities appointing their Chancellors through transparent selection processes within their governing bodies, fostering independence from external political pressures.
Way forward:
Decentralize University Governance:
Empower universities to elect or appoint Chancellors through their governing bodies, fostering institutional autonomy, and transparency to reduce external political interference.
Restrict the Governor’s Role to Ceremonial Functions:
Limit the Governor’s powers in university matters to a ceremonial capacity, ensuring that academic decisions align with the principles of state autonomy and federalism.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the essential conditions for the exercise of the legislative powers by the Governor. Discuss the legality of the re-promulgation of ordinances by the Governor without placing them before the Legislature.

**********The Union Budget as a turning point for climate action
Enviro & Biodiversity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Climate change;
Why in the News?
Everyone will be watching Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 as she presents the FY26 Budget, which needs to focus on climate issues and help India reach its Net-Zero goal by 2030.
How will the proposed climate finance taxonomy influence investment in sustainable projects?
Standardization and Clarity:
The proposed climate finance taxonomy will standardize definitions of green finance, providing clarity and reducing ambiguity for investors. This will help in distinguishing genuinely sustainable projects from those that are not, thereby building investor confidence.
A
green finance taxonomy
is a classification system that defines which activities, investments, or projects are considered “green” or environmentally sustainable.
Increased Investment:
By standardizing green finance definitions, the taxonomy can attract a significant portion of the ₹162.5 trillion ($2.5 trillion) needed to achieve India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by 2030. This is crucial for scaling up investments in sustainable projects.
Market Readiness:
The taxonomy will necessitate the development of institutional and technical infrastructure, including market readiness programs, verification systems, and capacity building of financial institutions. This will create a robust ecosystem for green investments.
Differential Tax Treatment:
The Budget could introduce differential tax treatment for investments aligned with the taxonomy, making green investments more attractive compared to conventional ones.
What specific measures are needed to incentivize green investments in the upcoming budget?
Expanding PLI Schemes for Solar Module Supply Chain
: India’s domestic solar module manufacturing capacity stands at 18-20 GW, while the annual demand is 30-35 GW. Imported solar panels are 65% cheaper than domestically produced ones.
So, need to expand the scope of PLI schemes can enhance domestic capacity and reduce dependency on imports.
Public-Private Partnerships for Railway Renewable Energy
: Indian Railways has 51,000 hectares of land available for renewable energy projects, yet only 142 MW of solar capacity has been installed so far, against a potential of 5 GW. Public-private partnerships can unlock this potential and align with the Railways’ decarbonization goals.
Establishing a Climate Action Fund for CBAM Compliance
: India’s exports of CBAM-covered products to the EU amount to $8.22 billion annually. MSMEs, which contribute 30% of GDP and 45% of exports, often lack resources for decarbonization. A dedicated Climate Action Fund could support MSMEs in meeting compliance requirements and maintaining competitiveness.
Fiscal Allocations for the RESCO Model
: Only 6.34 lakh (4.37%) of 1.45 crore registrations under the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijlee Yojana have been completed. Additionally, 60% of Indian households find rooftop solar installations unaffordable due to upfront costs.
The RESCO model can help by enabling financing solutions to bridge this affordability gap.
Tax Deductions and Depreciation Benefits for Circular Economy
: India generates 62 million tonnes of waste annually, with only 30% being recycled. Transitioning to a circular economy could contribute ₹40 lakh crore ($624 billion) annually by 2050.
Tax incentives and accelerated depreciation benefits can encourage private sector participation in recycling and resource efficiency.
What are the steps taken by the Government of India?
National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC):
Launched in 2008, this comprehensive framework includes eight missions aimed at addressing climate change through renewable energy promotion, enhanced energy efficiency, sustainable habitat development, and more.
Key missions include the National Solar Mission and the Green India Mission, which focus on increasing solar energy usage and enhancing forest cover, respectively.
Commitment to Renewable Energy:
India aims to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030 and has pledged to reduce total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes.
Adaptation and Resilience Initiatives:
The government has established the National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) to support projects that enhance resilience against climate impacts.
On the other hand, the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) aligns with NAPCC objectives, focusing on sector-specific adaptations in agriculture, water management, and biodiversity.
How can India ensure accountability and transparency in its climate financing efforts? (Way forward)
Sovereign Green Bond Framework:
Establish a sovereign green bond framework specifically for financing circular economy infrastructure, ensuring that funds are allocated transparently and used for their intended purposes.
Verification Systems:
Implement robust verification systems to ensure that projects funded through green finance taxonomy are genuinely sustainable and meet the required environmental standards.
Capacity Building:
Invest in capacity building of financial institutions to effectively implement the climate finance taxonomy, including training programs and technical support.
Government Expenditure Classification:
Commit to classifying government expenditure according to green criteria, ensuring that public funds are directed towards sustainable projects.
Regular Reporting and Audits:
Mandate regular reporting and audits of climate-related expenditures and projects to ensure accountability and transparency. This will help in tracking progress and making necessary adjustments to policies and allocations.
Mains PYQ:
‘Clean energy is the order of the day.’ Describe briefly India’s changing policy towards climate change in various international fora in the context of geopolitics.

**********Why Bombay HC said use of loudspeakers is not essential to religion?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Right to freedom of religion;
Why in the News?
The High Court was hearing a petition from two residents’ groups in Mumbai’s Nehru Nagar, Kurla (East), and Chunabhatti areas, complaining about mosques and madrasas using loudspeakers too loudly and at forbidden times.
What are the present directions by the Bombay High Court?
The Court directed the state to implement a
mechanism for controlling decibel levels
in loudspeakers and sound-emitting devices at religious places, suggesting the use of “calibration or auto-fixation” of decibel limits.
The Mumbai Police Commissioner is required to ensure police officers use mobile applications to measure decibel levels and identify violations.
A
four-step graded penalty system
was prescribed, including caution for first-time offenders, fines for repeat violations, seizure of loudspeakers and cancellation of licenses for continued violations, and initiation of complaints against the violators.
Why did the Bombay High Court rule that the use of loudspeakers is not essential to religious practices (ERP)?
Non-Essential Practice:
The court emphasized that using loudspeakers for prayers or religious discourses does not constitute an essential part of any religion. It clarified that such practices are not protected under Article 25 of the Constitution, which guarantees the freedom to practice religion.
Public Health Concerns:
The court highlighted that noise pollution poses significant health hazards. It asserted that allowing the unrestricted use of loudspeakers could infringe on the rights of residents living nearby, thus prioritizing public interest and health over the claimed religious rights associated with loudspeaker use.
Legal Framework Compliance:
The ruling reinforced that all religious institutions must comply with noise pollution regulations, specifically the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, which set permissible noise levels in residential areas. The court directed strict enforcement of these laws, indicating that violations should result in penalties rather than exemptions based on religion.
What are the Supreme Court Judgements related to essential religious practices (ERP)?
Shirur Mutt Case (1954):
This case established the foundation for the ERP doctrine, where the Supreme Court ruled that Article 25 protects not only religious beliefs but also the outward expressions of those beliefs through rituals and ceremonies. The court emphasized that what constitutes an essential part of religion should be determined based on the doctrines of that religion itself.
Durgah Committee Case (1961):
In this ruling, the Supreme Court adopted a more restrictive approach, stating that
only practices essential
and integral to a religion are protected under Article 25. The court differentiated between superstitious practices and those that are essential, marking a shift to a narrower interpretation of protected religious practices.
Ismail Faruqui v. Union of India (1995):
This case involved the Babri Masjid land acquisition issue. The Supreme Court held that while offering prayers is an essential Islamic practice, doing so in a
mosque is not necessarily required unless
the mosque has specific religious significance, highlighting an inconsistency in applying the ERP test.
Dr. Mahesh Vijay Bedekar v. Maharashtra (2016)
: The Supreme Court’s ruling emphasized that the use of loudspeakers is not an essential religious practice and cannot be claimed as a fundamental right under
Article 25 (freedom of religion)
Article 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression)
Sabarimala Temple Entry Case (2018):
The Supreme Court ruled that barring women from entering the Sabarimala temple violated their rights to equality and non-discrimination.
Way forward:
Implementation of Strict Noise Regulations
: Ensure effective enforcement of noise pollution laws, using technology like mobile apps to monitor decibel levels, and impose a clear and consistent penalty system for violations at religious places.
Public Awareness and Sensitization
: Raise awareness about the non-essential nature of loudspeaker use in religious practices, while balancing religious freedom with public health and the rights of nearby residents. Encourage dialogue between religious institutions and local authorities to find peaceful solutions.

Why is the Magnetic North Pole Moving?
moves due to the
dynamic flow of molten iron and other metals
in Earth’s
outer core
, which generates the planet’s magnetic field.
These movements cause
shifts in magnetic field lines
, leading to the pole’s drift over time.
The pole was first identified in Canada in
1831
and has since moved over
400 km
toward Russia.
Key Observations of Movement:
1990 to 2000
, the pole drifted at a rapid rate of
55 km/year
By
2015
, this rate slowed to
35 km/year
, but the drift remains
unpredictable
Currently, the pole is moving closer to
, reflecting changes in Earth’s core dynamics.
Impact of Movement:
The drift affects
aviation routes
Earth’s magnetic shielding
against harmful solar radiation.
Scientists monitor this movement using the WMM to ensure updated predictions and mitigate potential impacts on
navigation and environmental protection
