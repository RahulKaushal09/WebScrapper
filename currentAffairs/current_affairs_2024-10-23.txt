What is Cornea?
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare may amend the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994, to facilitate retrieval of cornea from all Indian patients who die in hospitals, without consent from the family.
About Cornea:
The cornea is the
clear outer layer at the front of the eye.
It
covers the pupil
(the opening at the center of the eye),
iris
(the colored part of the eye), and
anterior chamber (
the fluid-filled inside of the eye).
The cornea’s main function is to
refract, or bend light.
responsible for focusing
most of
the light that enters the eye.
Its specific shape plays a key role in how your eyesight works and
filters some ultraviolet (UV) rays.
Except at its margins, the cornea
contains no blood vessels
, but it does contain many nerves and is
very sensitive to pain or touch
Since there are
no nutrient-supplying blood vessels
in the cornea,
tears and the aqueous humor
(a watery fluid) in the anterior chamber
provide the cornea with nutrients.
As light passes
through the cornea, it is
partially refracted
before reaching the lens.
curvature
of the cornea
, which is
spherical in infancy
changes with age
gives it its focusing power
When
curve becomes irregular
, it causes a focusing
defect called astigmatism,
in which images appear elongated or distorted.
Because corneas are the
first line of defense
surface of your eye
, they’re also
prone to injuries
and damage.
The cornea tends to
repair itself quickly
from minor abrasions.
However,
deeper abrasions
may cause scars to form on the cornea, which causes the cornea to lose its transparency,
leading to visual impairment

It is one of the largest known stars, measuring more than 700 million miles (1.2 billion kilometers) in diameter.
It is known for its periodic dimming and brightening up.
exhibits two
distinct
pulsation patterns
: a short-term cycle of about a year and a longer six-year cycle.
The researchers concluded that the longer cycle, known as a long secondary period, is likely caused by the
Betelbuddy's (companion star) orbital motion
through Betelgeuse's surrounding dust.
What is Red supergiant star?
A red giant forms after a
star has run out of hydrogen fuel
for nuclear fusion, and has begun the process of dying.
They are evolved stars with masses between 10 and 25 times that of the Sun.
A star classed as a supergiant may have a diameter several hundred times that of the Sun and a luminosity nearly 1,000,000 times as great.
Supergiants are tenuous stars, and their
lifetimes are probably only a few million years,
extremely short on the scale of stellar evolution.

About Cloud Chamber:
A cloud chamber is a
scientific apparatus
that
mimics
the conditions required
for cloud formation.
It resembles a
closed cylindrical or tubular drum
, inside which water vapour, aerosols, etc. are injected.
Under the desired humidity and temperature inside this chamber
, a cloud can develop.
India is building a
cloud chamber with convection properties
, as required to study Indian monsoon clouds. Globally, there are only a handful of convective cloud chambers.
Objective:
The objective of establishing a convective cloud chamber is to
gain a better understanding of cloud physics
under conditions commonly affecting Indian weather systems. Thereafter, this knowledge can be used for strategic planning of weather modification.
The Pune facility will allow scientists to study the seed particles that form cloud droplets or ice particles in a sustained manner.
Cloud physics basically involves the study of cloud behaviour during normal and extreme conditions;
intra-particle interactions
inside a cloud; the formation of rain droplets and ice particles; the
influence of moisture
added into the atmosphere due to cyclones or low pressure systems; and interactions between different cloud layers, among others.
Significance:
Scientists will have the flexibility to tailor physical and atmospheric parameters to suit environmental requirements that influence the Indian weather and climate.

**********Biodiversity and Climate Change: COP16 and the Global Efforts to Address the Crisis
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Background, Context of the Article)
About Kunming-Montreal Framework (Objectives, Status)
High Sea Treaty & Ocean Conservation
Nagoya Protocol (Objective, Financial Mechanism for Biodiversity Conservation)
Introduction:
As the world grapples with the twin crises of
climate change
biodiversity loss
, global conferences like the
UN Biodiversity Conference (COP16)
, scheduled in
Cali, Colombia
, are gaining significance.
Following the
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
, which was established at the
1992 Rio Earth Summit
, COP16 focuses on protecting biodiversity, restoring ecosystems, and ensuring fair distribution of the benefits derived from the world's biological resources.
This meeting comes after a landmark agreement, the
Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework
(2022), which set ambitious targets for conserving biodiversity by 2030.
These conferences are increasingly gaining attention as the impact of environmental degradation becomes more apparent globally.
The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework:
, finalized at
COP15
in 2022, established four major goals and 23 specific targets to be achieved by 2030. One of the most prominent of these is the
30 x 30 target
, which aims to:
Conserve 30% of the world’s lands and oceans
by 2030, particularly focusing on biodiversity-rich areas.
Restore 30% of degraded land or marine ecosystems
This framework is an essential step in reversing biodiversity loss and restoring natural ecosystems.
However, progress has been slow, and one of the main objectives of
is to accelerate efforts to meet these targets.
Countries are required to submit their
National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs)
, which are equivalent to the
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
under the
Paris Climate Agreement
Despite the ambitious framework, only
32 countries
have submitted their NBSAPs, and more are expected to do so during
Interconnection Between Climate Change and Biodiversity:
The crises of
are deeply intertwined:
Climate change accelerates biodiversity loss
, with rising temperatures and erratic weather patterns destroying ecosystems.
In return,
ecosystem changes
—such as deforestation and ocean warming—contribute to
global warming
, further exacerbating climate issues.
Although these two crises have been addressed on separate tracks for decades, there is now a growing recognition of their interdependence.
As a result, biodiversity and climate discussions are starting to converge, with
focusing on biodiversity while parallel efforts continue in
climate change negotiations
High Seas Treaty and Ocean Conservation:
Another significant development in the fight against biodiversity loss is the finalization of the
, also known as the
Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdictions (BBNJ)
This treaty aims to protect biodiversity in oceans outside of national boundaries.
The treaty calls for the creation of
protected areas
in biodiversity-rich parts of the oceans where human activities can be regulated, similar to national parks on land.
Additionally, the treaty ensures equitable sharing of benefits from the exploitation of genetic resources in the oceans.
These genetic resources, ranging from microbes to large marine species, hold immense commercial potential, especially in the fields of
medicine
biotechnology
agriculture
ensures that these benefits are shared among all nations, not just a few.
Access and Benefit Sharing: The Nagoya Protocol
COP10
in 2010, laid down rules for
Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS)
This mechanism ensures that the benefits from the commercial use of biological resources are fairly distributed, especially to the countries and communities that own or manage these resources.
At
, countries are expected to discuss the sharing of benefits from the
digital genetic information
of plants and organisms.
Advances in science now allow genetic sequences to be stored and shared digitally, and these sequences are highly valuable for the creation of
high-yield crops
medicines
beauty products
The debate centres around how these digital sequences can be used and who gets to share in the profits, particularly
indigenous populations
who might have originally owned these resources.
Financial Mechanisms for Biodiversity Conservation:
Like in climate change discussions,
finance
plays a critical role in biodiversity negotiations.
One of the 23 targets of the
is to mobilize
$200 billion per year
by 2030 from all sources for biodiversity conservation. This includes:
$20 billion annually
from developed countries to developing nations for their biodiversity efforts.
An increase in this amount to
$30 billion per year
, the focus will also be on how countries can eliminate or repurpose
harmful subsidies
that negatively affect biodiversity, such as subsidies for
fossil fuels
overfishing
The goal is to redirect these subsidies to sustainable activities and scale up efforts to
$500 billion
Conclusion:
As the world moves towards addressing the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, conferences like
play a pivotal role in driving international cooperation and action.
, and the push for
financial mobilization
are crucial elements in the global fight to preserve biodiversity.
As biodiversity loss accelerates, there is a growing understanding that both developed and developing countries must work together to achieve these ambitious goals.
will be a critical platform for countries to make meaningful progress towards protecting our planet's biodiversity.

**********The SC's Verdict on Madarsa Education Act
Why in News?
The Supreme Court of India (SC) has reserved its judgement in a case concerning the constitutionality of the Uttar Pradesh (UP) Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004.
This verdict holds significant implications for the future of religious education in India, as it addresses key issues related to secularism, the right to education, and the intersection of religious and modern education.
What’s in Today’s Article?
What is the UP Madarsa Education Act 2004?
Status of Madarsas in UP
On What Grounds Allahabad HC Declared Madarsa Act Unconstitutional
Key Arguments on the Constitutionality of the Madarsa Education Act Before the SC
Wider Implications of the SC's Decision on the Madarsa Education Act
Conclusion
Governs madarsas:
The Act governs the education provided in madarsas - institutions which offer education that integrates religious teachings with some elements of modern, secular subjects, though religious instruction takes precedence.
Established the UP Board of Madarsa Education:
This board
, predominantly composed of members from the Muslim community,
is responsible for preparing curriculum and conducting examinations for various madarsa courses
, ranging
From ‘Maulvi’ (equivalent to Class 10)
To ‘Fazil’ (equivalent to a Master’s degree).
Status of Madarsas in UP:
The state has the highest number of madarsas in India
: In 2023, about 1.69 lakh students from over 14,000 recognised institutions took the UP Madarsa board exams, which correspond to the Class 10 and Class 12 levels.
The Madarsa Education Act was declared unconstitutional:
In March 2024, the Allahabad HC
struck down
the Act of 2004, deeming it unconstitutional and instructing the state government to integrate madarsa students into the formal education system.
What followed the HC decision?
The SC temporarily stayed the ruling in April 2024 and began hearing the case in October.
The SC also stayed two notifications issued by the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), which called for inspections of madarsas and the enrollment of non-Muslim students into these institutions.
On What Grounds Allahabad HC Declared Madarsa Act Unconstitutional:
Violation of secularism:
The HC referred to previous SC judgments to highlight that
secularism means equal treatment of all religions by the state
The court noted that the
madarsa curriculum made religious education on Islam compulsory
while offering modern subjects as optional, which it argued conflicted with the state’s duty to provide secular education.
The court emphasised that
the government should not favour any particular religion
or religious sect through education policies.
Violation of the right to education:
The HC held that the Madarsa Act violated
Article 21A
of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees free and compulsory education to all children between the ages of six and fourteen.
It argued that the curriculum offered in madarsas did not meet the standard of quality education as defined by
the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.
The court criticised the state for failing to ensure that madarsa students receive a comprehensive education in modern subjects.
Conflict with the UGC Act:
The Allahabad HC also found that the provisions of the Madarsa Act conflicted with
the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act, 1956
The UGC Act grants only recognised universities or deemed universities the authority to
confer degrees.
The madarsa board’s ability to grant degrees, therefore, was deemed unconstitutional, as it overstepped the boundaries set by the UGC Act.
Key Arguments on the Constitutionality of the Madarsa Education Act Before the SC:
Religious education vs. religious instruction:
A major point of contention was whether madarsas provide "religious education" or "religious instruction."
The distinction is crucial, as
Article 28
of the Indian Constitution prohibits religious instruction in state-funded educational institutions.
However, religious education, which provides knowledge about different religions, is permitted for fostering communal harmony.
Senior Advocate, representing the madarsa board, argued that the Allahabad HC
wrongly combined "religious education" with "religious instruction,"
leading to the conclusion that the Act violated secularism.
Striking down the entire Act:
Another key debate revolved around whether the HC should have struck down the entire Act or only specific provisions that were found to be unconstitutional.
Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud noted that
the state government has the authority to regulate madarsa education in a way that aligns with secular principles, without completely abolishing the Act
Wider Implications of the SC's Decision on the Madarsa Education Act:
The decision will likely have national ramifications
in addition to directly affecting how madarsas function in UP.
The case touches on broader issues concerning
The balance between religious education and secularism,
As well as the role of the state in ensuring that all children, regardless of their religious background, receive a modern, secular education.
The SC’s ruling could impact not only madarsas but also other religious educational institutions, such as
gurukuls and convent schools
, which incorporate religious teachings into their curricula.
Therefore, CJI issued a warning that when regulating religious instruction, secularism principles need to be properly taken into account.
Conclusion:
The SC’s forthcoming judgement in the madarsa education case could set a significant precedent for religious education in India.
This case has the
potential to reshape how religious and secular education coexist
in India’s diverse educational landscape.

Territorial disputes and regional interests can influence the decision-making process.
Relationship with Western Powers
Relationship of BRICS with Western powers is complex, as BRICS countries often have differing strategies regarding the West.
Both China and Russia are now viewing the West with a lot more suspicion than before. This is due to Russia - Ukraine War and frequent roadblocks in US-China ties.
India, meanwhile, has been deepening its relations in spheres of economy and technology with the US.
Slow Progress on Institutional Reforms
Despite advocating for a more democratic and multipolar global order, progress on reforming global institutions like the IMF and UN has been slow.
The group's influence is often limited by entrenched global power structures.
China’s Economic Dominance
China, as the largest economy within BRICS, often has a dominant influence on the group's economic agenda.
This can create an imbalance and generate concerns among other member states about Beijing's increasing sway in the bloc's decision-making.
Host
– Russia (16
BRICS summit is being held in Kazan, one of Russia's largest and wealthiest cities).
Agenda
The central theme uniting BRICS members is their disillusionment with Western-led global governance, particularly in the economic sphere.
This sentiment has intensified following the sanctions on Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which raised concerns among Global South nations about the
West potentially using global financial tools as weapons
In response, BRICS aims to reduce reliance on the US dollar and the SWIFT financial system, from which Russian banks were excluded in 2022.
In 2023, Brazil's President Lula proposed a trading currency for BRICS, though experts expressed doubts about its feasibility.
Instead, the focus is shifting to using national currencies for bilateral trade, reducing exposure to currency fluctuations and dependence on the dollar
Additionally, China has developed a limited alternative to SWIFT, while countries like Turkey and Brazil are increasing their gold reserves.
Currency swaps for energy deals are also gaining popularity, all reflecting a desire for greater financial autonomy from the West.
Kazan: Russia’s Emerging Third Capital
Known for its strong petrochemicals, military industry, and rapidly expanding IT sector, Kazan was branded Russia's third capital in 2009.
This designation highlights its status as a cultural and economic hub alongside Moscow and St Petersburg.
Kazan’s Significance in Russia’s Demographic Changes
Kazan, located 900 km east of Moscow at the confluence of the Volga and Kazanka rivers, is the
capital of the Republic of Tatarstan
The city’s population is almost evenly split between ethnic Russians (48.6%) and Tatars (47.6%), a predominantly Muslim Turkic ethnic group.
demographic balance makes Kazan a symbol of Russia's evolving identity as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation
Cultural Symbols in Kazan
Kazan’s diversity is visible in its city kremlin, a fortified complex housing the
Orthodox Annunciation Cathedral
the Kul Sharif Mosque
, one of Europe's largest.
The mosque, initially destroyed by Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century, was reconstructed in 2005 with assistance from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
