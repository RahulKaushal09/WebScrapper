Leveraging Transit-Oriented Development to Build Productive Cities
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction
Transit-Oriented Development (Meaning, Benefits, Challenges, Case Study, etc.)
Key Recommendations for TOD
Way Forward
Introduction:
Indian cities are on the cusp of a major transformation in transportation, with an
estimated ₹3 trillion to be invested in metro rail projects between 2022 and 2027
This massive investment in public transportation not only aims to enhance urban mobility but also unlock significant economic potential by improving accessibility to jobs and boosting productivity.
Rise of Transit-Oriented Development:
To harness the full benefits of investments in mass transit, the Government of India introduced the
National Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Policy and Metro Rail Policy
in 2017.
TOD is an urban planning strategy that integrates land use with transport infrastructure, promoting compact, mixed-use developments and sustainable transport modes such as walking, cycling, and mass transit.
Currently,
27 Indian cities are developing metro systems
, and many more are building other rail- and bus-based transit systems.
Benefits of TOD:
TOD offers a promising solution by
effectively integrating land use and transport
, decoupling economic growth from congestion and carbon emissions.
It promotes the
development of job clusters near transit
, enhancing workforce productivity and participation.
Proximity to transit stations
boosts job densities
, creating an agglomeration effect that fosters innovation, productivity, and competitiveness.
Challenges of TOD:
Public policies and land market conditions have led to the development of economic centers in suburban and peri-urban areas, causing public transport systems to struggle with
growing urban sprawl
The increased reliance on private vehicles results in longer commutes, higher congestion, and pollution, all of which
negatively impact productivity
and access to job markets.
For instance, Bengaluru, one of the most congested cities globally, incurs an estimated social cost of ₹38,000 crore annually due to traffic congestion.
Case Study – Bengaluru:
A recent study by
WRI India
, titled "
Jobs near Metro Rail Transit in Bengaluru: Enabling an Accessible and Productive City
," highlights the importance of TOD in Bengaluru.
The study examines the spatial distribution of jobs around the city's metro network, which includes operational and under-construction phases (Phases 1, 2, and 2A-2B).
It also assesses the benefits and challenges businesses face when locating near metro stations.
Key Findings Include:
Bengaluru has approximately 0.2 million registered enterprises employing around 4.6 million workers, with the service sector accounting for the majority.
Large enterprises, although only 2% of total enterprises, contribute to 60% of jobs.
Job densities are highest in inner-city areas, particularly around tech hubs like Whitefield and Electronic City, where densities range from 58,000 to 1,09,000 jobs per square kilometer.
Once the ongoing metro phases are completed, 28% of mapped jobs in Bengaluru will be within 500 meters of a metro station, 59% within 1 km, and 85% within 2 km, significantly improving access to employment opportunities.
Key Recommendations for Enhancing TOD:
To maximize the economic benefits of TOD, the study offers several actionable recommendations:
Enhance Job Clusters Near Transit
: Encourage businesses to locate near metro stations to capitalize on increased foot traffic and workforce accessibility.
Improve Integrated Planning
: Foster collaboration between urban planners, transport authorities, and businesses to create cohesive development strategies around transit corridors.
Address Market and Regulatory Challenges
: Streamline regulatory processes and address market barriers that hinder businesses from setting up near transit hubs.
Global Examples and Lessons:
High-functioning cities like
Hong Kong demonstrate the success of TOD, with 57% of jobs located within 500 meters of a transit station
Hong Kong’s emphasis on transit connectivity has significantly boosted economic productivity while reducing car ownership and carbon emissions.
Way Forward:
To fully leverage TOD, Indian cities need to set ambitious targets for job densities near transit stations and prioritize areas for densification and renewal.
Public policies should offer incentives such as additional development rights or tax subsidies to encourage businesses to locate near transit.
Partnerships between public and private sectors, along with value capture financing mechanisms, can fund station area improvements and enhance last-mile connectivity.

**********SC Strengthening Law Against Child Pornography in India
Why in News?
Marking a significant move in the fight against child exploitation, the Supreme Court of India emphasised that the consumption of sexually explicit content involving minors is a severe criminal offence under the
POCSO Act
.
The top court
overruled a controversial judgement by the Madras HC
, which held that passive consumption of child pornography did not constitute an offence under the POCSO Act or the Information Technology (IT) Act.
What’s in Today’s Article?
The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act
Examining the SC's Decision to Tighten the Law on Child Pornography
SC’s Recommendations to the Centre to Address the Issue of Child Pornography
The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act:
About:
It is the
first comprehensive law
in the country enacted in
2012
for dealing specifically with sexual abuse of children.
Administered by the
Ministry of Women and Child Development
, the law is
intended to
Protect children from sexual assault
, sexual harassment and pornographic violations.
Establish Special Courts for such trials.
2019
, the Act was amended to strengthen the penalties for specified offences in order to deter abusers and promote a dignified upbringing.
Key provisions:
Gender-neutral legislation:
The Act defines a child as "any person" under the age of 18.
Non-reporting is a crime:
Any person in charge of an institution (excluding children) who fails to report the commission of a sexual offence involving a subordinate faces punishment.
No time limit for reporting abuse:
A victim may report an offence at any time, even years after the abuse has occurred.
Keeping victim’s identity confidential:
The Act forbids the disclosure of the victim's identity in any form of media unless authorised by the special courts established by the Act.
Concerns:
Such abuse is on the rise:
Particularly since the Covid-19 outbreak, when new forms of cybercrime have emerged.
Lack of awareness or knowledge:
On the part of minor girls, boys, parents and society as a whole.
Examining the SC's Decision to Tighten the Law on Child Pornography:
The provision of the POCSO Act in question:
The Bench (led by the CJI) expanded the interpretation of
Section 15
of the POCSO Act, which deals with the “
Punishment for storage of pornographic material involving child
”.
Section 15 of the POCSO Act:
It punishes any person, who stores or possesses pornographic material in any form involving a child,
With an intention to share or transmit child pornography;
For commercial purposes, etc.
With a three-to-five-year jail sentence.
SC’s verdict:
Section 15 is not limited to punishing the sharing or transmitting of child pornographic material, and
could even be used to punish the “intent”
to commit such an act.
For instance
, the court held that a failure to “delete or destroy or report” child pornography would allow the court to “indirectly” infer that the concerned individual intended to share or distribute it under Section 15.
Overturning the Madras HC judgement,
the SC expanded the definition of “possession”
in child pornography cases to include cases -
Where the individual may not have physical possession of child pornographic material.
But they have the power to control the material in question and the knowledge of exercise of such control.
The court termed this “
constructive possession
” and held that “viewing, distributing or displaying” such material would still amount to it being in the accused’s “possession” under Section 15.
SC’s Recommendations to the Centre to Address the Issue of Child Pornography:
Amend the POCSO Act:
To replace the term “child pornography” with “child sexual exploitative and abuse material” (
CSEAM
) to better reflect the nature of the crime.
Help victims to heal and reintegrate into society:
By providing psychological counselling, therapeutic interventions and educational support to victims.
Introducing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programmes:
To help address the cognitive distortions that fuel such behaviour among offenders.
Promoting coordinated effort:
Among educators, health care providers, law enforcement and child welfare services to identify individuals with problematic sexual behaviours early and implement intervention strategies.
Raising awareness:
Public campaigns should aim to de-stigmatise reporting and encourage vigilance within the community.
Formation of an expert committee:
To devise comprehensive programmes for health and
sex education
and increasing awareness of POCSO among children from an early age, and
To give effect to above suggestions.

**********NBFC sector resilient under scale-based regulations framework: RBI bulletin
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Significance of NBFC sector;
Why in the News?
During the transition to the Scale-Based Regulation (SBR) framework, the NBFC sector experienced double-digit credit growth, maintained adequate capital levels, and saw a reduction in delinquency ratios.
What is Scale-Based Regulation (SBR)?
The SBR framework was first outlined in October 2021 and became effective on October 1, 2022.
It aims to categorize NBFCs based on their size, activities, and perceived riskiness rather than merely distinguishing between systemically important and non-systemically important entities.
What are the key points presented by RBI on the resilience of the NBFC sector?
Improvement in Asset Quality
: Since the introduction of the
framework in October 2022, the asset quality of NBFCs has improved, with lower gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratios.
By December 2023, GNPA ratios had decreased to
2.4%
for government-owned NBFCs and
6.3%
for non-government NBFCs, reflecting enhanced risk management.
Double-Digit Credit Growth
: The NBFC sector maintained strong credit growth throughout 2023, driven by a diversified funding base, including retail credit (gold loans, vehicle loans, and housing loans) and expanding into industrial and service sectors.
Improved Profitability
: The sector witnessed a rise in profitability, as evidenced by better returns on assets (RoA) and equity (RoE).
Net NPA (NNPA) Performance
: Upper layer NBFCs had lower GNPA ratios than middle layer NBFCs, but the latter maintained sufficient provisions for riskier portfolios, ensuring that their NNPA ratios were also controlled.
Compliance with SBR
: Major NBFCs in the “Upper Layer” identified by the RBI under the SBR framework, such as
LIC Housing Finance, Bajaj Finance, and L&T Finance,
have complied or initiated steps to comply with listing requirements.
Regulatory measures  taken up by the NBFC sector
Scale-Based Regulation (SBR) Framework
: Introduced in October 2022, the SBR framework categorizes NBFCs into different layers based on their size, systemic importance, and risk profile. For instance, strengthen asset quality, capital requirements, and risk management.
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Norms
: Effective from October 2024, PCA norms will apply to government-owned NBFCs. These measures aim to enhance financial discipline, focusing on capital adequacy and asset quality.
Diversification of Funding Sources
: Due to rising risk weights on bank lending, NBFCs have diversified their funding base by reducing dependence on bank borrowings and expanding into secured retail credit.
Listing Compliance
: Many NBFCs in the upper layer have complied or are in the process of complying with listing requirements as part of regulatory mandates.
What are the emerging risks that NBFCs need to cater? (Way forward)
Cybersecurity Risks
: With the increasing use of digital platforms, NBFCs need to
enhance cybersecurity measures
to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.
Climate Risk
: The financial impact of climate change poses a new risk. NBFCs must
integrate climate-related risks
into their risk management frameworks to mitigate potential disruptions.
Financial Assurance Functions
: The RBI emphasizes that assurance functions like
risk management, compliance,
internal audit
are critical in maintaining resilience in the face of rapid changes in the financial landscape.
Evolving Regulatory Environment
: As the financial sector continues to evolve, NBFCs must stay
ahead of regulatory changes
and ensure that their risk management practices are aligned with emerging threats and new regulations.
**********Why Ambedkar and Gandhi disagreed on question of separate electorates for SC’s?
History and Art & Culture
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Poona Pact;
Mains level:
Gandhi vs Ambedkar on Caste;
Why in the News?
On September 20, 1932, Mahatma Gandhi began a fast unto death in Yerawada Jail, Pune, to protest against the provision of separate electorates for Scheduled Castes.
Gandhi’s Views on Caste
: Initially orthodox, Gandhi supported social prohibitions like
restrictions on inter-dining and inter-marriage
but later rejected untouchability, referring to untouchables as “Harijans.” However, he did not reject the
institution of caste itself,
as it was tied to Hindu religious practices.
Ambedkar’s Radical Approach
: Ambedkar believed that to
truly abolish caste,
one needed to attack the divine authority of the Hindu scriptures (shastras) that justified it. He argued that
reforms short of rejecting the religious basis of caste
were insufficient.
Ambedkar’s strategy was to focus on
lower castes
achieving
political power
to challenge their subjugation within the Hindu social order.
Ambedkar’s Argument for Separate Electorates
Distinct Identity of Depressed Classes
: Ambedkar argued that the
Depressed Classes (Scheduled Castes)
formed a distinct group, separate from the Hindus. Despite being part of Hindu society, they
did not enjoy equal treatment
and were subject to systemic oppression.
Political Machinery for Representation
: Ambedkar advocated for separate electorates with a double vote system, where Scheduled Castes would vote for their own candidates as well as in the general electorate.
Protection from Majority Rule
: Ambedkar warned that joint electorates would allow the Hindu majority to control the election of Dalit representatives, making it impossible for
to effectively protect their interests against the tyranny of the majority.
Why Gandhi Opposed Separate Electorates
Integration of Lower Castes
: Gandhi opposed separate electorates because he believed they would
marginalize lower castes further
Instead of being restricted to a limited share of seats, Gandhi thought lower castes should aim for
broader participation
political leadership.
Fear of Dividing Hindu Society
: Gandhi feared that separate electorates would
divide Hindu society
, further weakening it.
He believed this division would help the British continue their
“divide and rule” policy,
undermining India’s struggle for independence.
Strategic Concerns
: The introduction of separate electorates for Scheduled Castes, in addition to those for Muslims, would
fragment the Hindu political base
, reducing the power and influence of upper-caste Hindu leadership.
Culmination of the Debate: The Poona Pact
Gandhi’s Fast
: In 1932, Gandhi went on a fast unto death to oppose separate electorates, pressuring
Ambedkar to concede
. Ambedkar, despite his misgivings, agreed to the Poona Pact, which provided for
reserved seats for Scheduled Castes
but within a joint electorate.
Ambedkar’s Dissatisfaction
: Ambedkar was never fully satisfied with the outcome, believing the
joint electorate allowed upper-caste Hindus
to nominate Dalit representatives, effectively controlling their political voice.
Conclusion:
The Gandhi-Ambedkar debate on caste culminated in the Poona Pact, with Gandhi opposing separate electorates to maintain Hindu unity, while Ambedkar sought political power for lower castes. Though Ambedkar agreed, he remained dissatisfied with the compromise.
Mains PYQ:
Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. B R Ambedkar, despite having divergent approaches and strategies, had a common goal of amelioration of the downtrodden. Elucidate.

**********How Supreme Court strengthened child pornography law?
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Effectiveness of POCSO Act;
Why in the News?
In a recent ruling, the Supreme Court has tightened child pornography laws, declaring that viewing, possessing, or failing to report such content is punishable under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, regardless of whether the material is shared or transmitted.
What is the law in question?
The Supreme Court expanded the interpretation of
Section 15 of the POCSO Act
, which deals with
“Punishment for storage of pornographic material involving child”.
In 2019, the POCSO Act was amended to introduce three connected offences under Sections 15(1), (2) and (3) with increasing grades of punishment:
Any person, who
stores or possesses pornographic
material involving a
child,
but fails to delete, destroy or report the same to the
designated authority with an intention to share or transmit child pornography.
Any person, who stores or possesses such material for transmitting, propagating, displaying or distributing in any manner at any time except for reporting or use as evidence in court.
Any person, who stores or possesses such material for commercial purpose.
The court refers to these as
“inchoate”
offences – offences in
anticipation or preparation
for committing a
further criminal act.
About the Case and SC’s Verdict
Case Background
: The Supreme Court was dealing with a case where the Madras High Court had quashed criminal proceedings against a man who had downloaded child pornography but did not share it.
The High Court had
limited
its ruling to
Section 14
POCSO (using children for pornography)
and excluded
Section 15 (punishing possession)
since no evidence of sharing existed.
Supreme Court’s Verdict
The SC overturned the Madras High Court’s ruling,
expanding the definition
“possession”
of child pornography to include
“constructive possession”
even without physical storage of the material.
Viewing, controlling, or exercising knowledge
over such material (e.g., watching without downloading) was deemed sufficient for possession.
The SC stressed that even
failing to delete or report
such content implies intent to share and is punishable under
Section 15(1)
Even if the accused does not have the material at the time of filing the FIR, they can still be held accountable if they had possessed it
“at any point”
How will such cases be registered?
Determination of Intention
: The court held that the
intention (mens rea)
of the accused will be determined based on the circumstances, such as how the material was stored or possessed and why it was not reported or destroyed.
Actions like
storing, not deleting, or failing to report
child pornography can be used as evidence of intent to share or distribute.
Role of Police
: The police must not limit their investigation to only one sub-section of
. Even if a specific offence isn’t made out, the police should explore the possibility of other violations under different sub-sections.
Reporting Obligation
: The court emphasized the
mandatory reporting
of child pornography, with penalties for failing to report starting from
a fine of Rs. 5,000
and increasing for repeat offences.Failure to report, even after merely viewing child pornographic material, can result in legal consequences.
Conclusion:
The Supreme Court’s ruling on the POCSO Act broadened the definition of possession, emphasizing that failure to delete or report child pornography constitutes intent to share, with strict penalties for non-compliance, underscoring the obligation to report such content.
**********How Starlink satellites are ‘blinding’ astronomers?

unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR)
.
What is a Starlink Satellite?
are part of a network created by
Elon Musk’s SpaceX
to provide
high-speed internet
to remote areas around the world.
The network, known as a
satellite constellation
, currently includes more than
6,300 satellites
orbiting Earth at around
550 km altitude
These satellites aim to offer internet connectivity to places that would otherwise lack access, especially in
rural or underserved regions
Why Radio Astronomy matters?
Radio astronomy is a branch of astronomy that
studies
celestial objects
radio frequencies
instead of visible light
Radio telescopes
detect
radio waves
, which are longer than light waves, emitted by objects in space such as stars, galaxies, and even black holes.
Radio astronomy is important because it helps scientists
study the universe
beyond what can be seen with optical telescopes.
Radio noise
from sources like
can interfere with these observations, making it difficult for astronomers to collect data, similar to how
bright lights
can obscure faint stars.
What Starlink does to Space Communications?
are designed to improve
global internet access
, especially in hard-to-reach places, by transmitting signals from space.
However, these satellites also emit
, which causes
radio noise
that disrupts
observations.
The situation may worsen as more satellites are launched — some estimates suggest
100,000 satellites
could be orbiting Earth by
2030
There are currently
no regulations
controlling how much
radio pollution
these satellites can emit, making it harder for
to mitigate the impact on their work.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
BNSS, Section 107
Why in the News?
The
Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023
introduced
, which focuses on properties classified as
“proceeds of crime”
.
Previously, this term was associated with laws like the
Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
or within the
Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)
under provisions for
attachment and forfeiture
About
Section 107 of the BNSS, 2023 pertains to the
attachment and forfeiture of property
categorized as
“proceeds of crime.”
It grants the
court
the authority to attach property at the request of a
police officer
during an
ongoing investigation
The request must be approved by a
Superintendent
Commissioner of Police
This section gives the
court unbridled powers
to attach any property believed to be derived from
criminal activities
and, under specific conditions, to
it to the
government
There is
no requirement
for the police officer to wait until the completion of the investigation (unlike earlier laws).
Property can be attached
during the investigation
It differs from the
PMLA, 2002
, in that there are
no preconditions
like documenting the reasons for believing the property is a result of criminal activity.
After attachment, if the court finds the property to be
, it can direct the
District Magistrate
to distribute the proceeds to the
affected persons
60 days
If no claimants are identified, the proceeds are
forfeited
to the government.
There is a requirement for issuing a
show-cause notice
14 days
for the property attachment, and the court can pass an
ex parte order
if no representation is made.
Its significance
Empowers Law Enforcement:
It allows attachment of property during investigations, preventing criminals from hiding or transferring assets.
Faster Relief for Victims:
It enables quick distribution of proceeds of crime to affected persons even before the trial concludes.
Stronger Deterrence:
It acts as a deterrent by allowing the forfeiture of criminally acquired assets, impacting offenders financially.
State-Level Enforcement:
It empowers State governments to manage proceeds of crime, providing more localized control.

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Greenland Landslide, Dickson Fjord
Why in the News?
In
September 2023
, seismic stations across the world detected an unusual signal which
persisted for 9 days.
It was caused by a
massive landslide
Greenland’s Dickson Fjord
(i.e narrow sea inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by a glacier).
About the Massive Greenland Landslide
The landslide involved a colossal volume of
25 million cubic metres
of rock and ice, equivalent to filling
10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools
25 million cubic meters
of rock and ice, which is enough to fill
This event caused a
mega-tsunami
with waves as high as
200 meters
, which significantly impacted the area.
The seismic waves created by the landslide lasted for
9 consecutive days
The loss of such a large amount of
glacier ice
highlights how
global warming
is speeding up damage to these fragile environments.
Causes of the Greenland Landslide
The main reason for the landslide was
, which caused the
glaciers
in Greenland to melt and shrink over recent decades.
Hvide Stovhorn peak
glacier had been holding up the mountain slopes, but as it thinned, the rock above it became unstable and eventually collapsed.
permafrost
(frozen ground) on the mountain’s steep slopes started
melting
because of rising temperatures, making the slopes unstable.
When the rocks and ice fell into the fjord, it triggered a
submarine landslide
(a landslide under water), which made the event even bigger and caused a
