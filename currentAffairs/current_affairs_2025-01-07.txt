Key takeaways
Crimea is a peninsula in Eastern Europe, located on the northern coast of the Black Sea and almost entirely surrounded by the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.
The peninsula is divided into three main zones: mountains, steppe, and the southern coast. The Crimean Mountains rise to 1,545 meters at their highest point, Roman-Kosh.
Water Bodies: Crimea has numerous rivers, including the Salhyr, Alma, Kacha, and Belbek. It also has several salt pans and salty lakes, with Lake Sasyk being the largest.
Crimea was part of Ukraine until 2014, when Russia annexed the peninsula, a move that was widely condemned by the international community.
Economy
Agriculture: The steppe region of Crimea is under intensive agricultural cultivation, with crops like winter wheat, corn, potatoes, and sunflowers.
Industry: Crimea has a spa industry due to its mud volcanoes and mineral springs, and large-scale iron ore mining in the Kerch Peninsula.
Crimea Bridge: Constructed in 2018, this bridge spans the Strait of Kerch, linking Crimea with Russia.

GURU GOBIND SINGH
Prelims – HISTORY
Every year, Guru Gobind Singh Jayanti is observed on January 6 to commemorate the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Sikh Guru.
It is one of the most significant festivals for the Sikh community. This day also commemorates Guru Gobind Singh’s leadership and influence in developing Sikh identity and principles such as equality, justice, and community service.
Guru Gobind Singh was named the tenth and last Guru of the Sikhs at the age of nine, following the death of his father, Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Guru.
Guru Tegh Bahadur was martyred by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb for refusing to convert to Islam.
Guru Gobind Singh is known to have introduced the five ‘K’s, the Five Articles of Faith that the Sikhs abide by: Kesh: uncut hair, Kangha: a wooden comb, Kara: an iron or steel bracelet worn on the wrist, Kirpan: a sword, Kacchera: short breeches.
Guru Gobind Singh is credited with the Dasam Granth whose hymns are a sacred part of Sikh prayers and Khalsa rituals.
Guru Gobind Singh declared the Holy Scriptures of Guru Granth Sahib as the permanent Guru of Sikhs. He passed away in 1708.
Guru Gobind Singh established the institution of Panj Piare while founding the Khalsa on the day of Baisakhi in 1699. Addressing a large gathering, he asked for five heads for sacrifice. Five men responded to his call and the Guru baptised them and called them Panj Piare.
The inaugural group of Panj Piare formed the nucleus of the Khalsa. However, the term is not limited only to this inaugural group. After them, any group of five baptised Sikhs are also referred to as the Panj Pyare.
Guru Gobind Singh’s four sons, were killed during his lifetime – the elder two in a battle with Mughals, and the younger two executed by the Mughal governor of Sirhind.
Guru Gobind Singh led several battles against the Mughal Empire and hill rajas.
Aurangzeb died in 1707, and immediately a succession struggle began between his sons who attacked each other. Guru Gobind Singh supported Bahadur Shah I in the Battle of Jajau.
In 1708 the Guru was assassinated after being stabbed by a Pashtun in Nanded, Maharashtra, on the orders of Mughal ruler Nawab Wazir Khan of Sirhind, who was driven by insecurity over the Guru’s cordial relations with Emperor Bahadur Shah.
When Bahadur Shah learned that the Guru had been stabbed, he dispatched surgeons, to tend to his injuries. Despite their efforts, the wounds reopened after being stitched, leading to the Guru’s death on October 7, 1708.

ENHANCING GOVERNANCE THE DIGITAL WAY
Mains – GS 2
In recent years, India has embarked on an ambitious journey toward digital governance. Despite the strides made, more needs to be done to fully realise the potential of digital governance.
At its core, governance is a complex web of decision-making processes that involves stakeholders, from government bodies and non-governmental organisations to local community leaders and influential citizens.
India’s transition to digital governance aims to improve citizen services and enhance government workforce capabilities.
Digital governance represents a paradigm shift in how government employees and associated service providers or intermediaries such as contractors should engage with their work.
The adoption of technology in governance facilitates more effective communication, informed decision-making, and streamlined workflows.
Capacity Building in Digital Governance
The pressing need for government employees to become adept at navigating digital platforms is paramount in a world that is increasingly technology-driven.
Initiatives such as the iGOT Karmayogi platform have taken centre-stage. The online training portal aims to equip officials with essential skills in data analytics, public administration, and digital technologies.
Equally transformative is the e-Office initiative, which digitises government workflows, drastically reducing reliance on paperwork and enhancing operational efficiency. By automating file management, workflows, and grievance redress, the initiative promotes real-time communication and transparency.
Another initiative is the transition of procurement processes to the online sphere, with platforms like the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) playing a crucial role.
Challenges in Digital Governance
Resistance to Change: Government workforce segments exhibit varying levels of readiness and enthusiasm for adopting new technologies.
Lack of Incentives: The lack of incentives raises concerns that initiatives such as the iGOT Karmayogi platform could become merely attendance trackers. It is worth considering whether trainings lead to meaningful outcomes — such as opportunities to apply new skills through relevant job postings.
Digital Divide: Limited access to high-speed Internet and digital tools, especially in rural areas.
Cybersecurity Concerns: Increased risks of data breaches and cyberattacks with online operations.
Continuous Learning Needs: Rapid technological evolution demands ongoing training and upskilling opportunities for government employees.
The Way Forward for Digital Governance
Robust Infrastructure: Address the digital divide through improved connectivity and access to tools in rural areas.
Targeted Training: Ensure training programs are outcome-driven and adaptable to emerging technologies.
Cybersecurity Frameworks: Develop and implement strong cybersecurity protocols.
Incentives for Innovation: Recognise and reward employees who excel in adopting and applying digital tools.
Inclusivity: Equip every employee, regardless of rank, background, or location, with skills to thrive in the digital age.

NET ZERO BANKING ALLIANCE (NZBA)
Prelims – INTERNATIONAL
Within the span of a month, Wall Street’s biggest banks have quit what had been one of the most popular clubs inside global finance – The Net-Zero Banking Alliance.
The Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) was founded on 21 April 2021 by leading global financial institutions under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI).
Bank-led and UN-convened, the Net Zero Banking Alliance is a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The Net-Zero Banking Alliance has in quick succession been abandoned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest US bank, looks to be next in line.
By joining the alliance, banks commit to:
Aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050
Setting interim targets for 2030 or sooner
Focusing on the most carbon-intensive sectors
Annually reporting on progress and emissions
Since its inception, the NZBA has grown significantly, now representing nearly half of global banking assets and, despite the departure of the large US banks, it still has 142 members from 44 countries.
US banks leaving the group reflects banks’ desire to shield themselves from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House.

THE ARUNACHAL PRADESH FREEDOM OF RELIGION ACT
The Arunachal Pradesh government is working to bring a 1978 Act against “forceful” conversion out of cold storage by framing rules for its implementation, 46 years after it was enacted.
The Act was enacted by the then Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh’s first Legislative Assembly. Since it was enacted in 1978, successive governments have not framed the rules for its implementation, because of which it has laid dormant.
The Act prohibits religious conversion by use of force or inducement or by fraudulent means and entails punishment of imprisonment for up to two years, and a fine of up to Rs. 10,000 for the offence of converting or attempting to convert forcefully from one religious faith to another faith.
The Act also requires that every act of conversion be reported to the Deputy Commissioner of the district concerned.
The Act specifies that “religious faiths” in this context include “indigenous” faiths. Included in this definition is Buddhism as practised among the Monpas, Membas, Sherdukpens, Khambas, Khamptis and Singphos; nature worship including the worship of Donyi-Polo among communities in the state; and Vaishnavism in practised by Noctes and Akas.
Why had it been introduced?
Arunachal Pradesh is home to a number of different small ethnic communities with an array of different beliefs and practices.
Unlike other hilly North Eastern states, Christianity did not become common among Arunachal tribes till the 1950s. This was not just due to the difficult terrain, but also the colonial policy of isolating the “frontier regions” which included restrictions on the entry of missionaries. These restrictions continued even after Independence with the Inner Line system.
Missionary efforts in the foothill areas of Assam led to inroads into what was then the North East Frontier Agency in the 1950s. In the coming decades, census data indicated growth in the number of people identifying as Christians.
The number of Christians in the state has grown rapidly over the years, and in the last census of 2011, they were enumerated as 30.26% of the population, making Christianity the largest religion in the state.
Why is the Act back now?
In 2022, Tambo Tamin, associated with Indigenous Faiths and Cultural Society of Arunachal Pradesh (IFCSAP), filed a PIL in the Gauhati High Court appealing for the court to intervene over the failure of the government to frame rules for the Act.
On September 30 this year, after the Advocate General of Arunachal Pradesh told the court that draft rules had been framed and their finalisation would take another six months, the court closed the petition stating “we expect the concerned authorities to be mindful of their obligations and the draft rules would be finalised within a period of six months from today.”

**********The Collegium and Changes, It May Still Be Early Days
Context
recent developments concerning the Supreme Court of India’s Collegium system have rekindled debates
about its effectiveness and necessity for reform.
Two
noteworthy resolutions have come to light: the Collegium’s decision to conduct interviews of candidates for High Court judgeships and its intention to limit the selection of candidates
with close familial ties to existing judges.
However,
these steps, laudable as they might be, must be viewed alongside the long-standing concerns surrounding the Collegium's structure
, transparency, and its interplay with the executive branch.
Evolution of the Collegium System
The Collegium system
owes its existence to judicial interpretations rather than constitutional directives.
Envisioned as a mechanism to safeguard judicial independence,
it emerged from the Second Judges Case (1993), where the Supreme Court interpreted ‘consultation’ in Article 124 of the Constitution to mean ‘concurrence’ by a Collegium
comprising the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and senior judges.
This decision
aimed to protect judicial appointments from undue executive influence
, establishing the judiciary as a self-regulating institution.
A Deeper Examination of Challenges to Collegium’s Effectiveness
Opacity in Functioning
decision-making process is conducted behind closed doors
, with no formal minutes or publicly available records of deliberations.
This secrecy undermines public trust
in the judiciary and creates an environment where allegations of favouritism, nepotism, and bias can thrive.
absence of clear criteria for evaluating candidates further complicates this issue
, leaving the process vulnerable to subjectivity and inconsistency.
Executive Interference and Delays
Despite the judiciary's primacy in appointments,
the executive wields significant power to delay or obstruct Collegium recommendations.
government can employ various tactics to impede the process
, such as:
executive often sits on recommendations indefinitely
, neither rejecting nor approving them.
stalling tactic creates uncertainty
and undermines judicial efficiency.
government may cherry-pick recommendations
, accepting some while returning others for reconsideration without adequate justification.
Nepotism and Lack of Diversity
Judges are often accused of favouring candidates
with familial or professional ties to existing members of the judiciary.
practice limits opportunities for deserving candidates
from diverse backgrounds, leading to a judiciary that is not representative of the broader society.
While the recent resolution to exclude candidates with close familial ties to serving judges is a step in the right direction
, its implementation remains uncertain.
Moreover,
excluding candidates solely based on familial connections may inadvertently disqualify highly competent individuals,
highlighting the need for nuanced reforms.
Absence of Binding Rules
operates without a codified set of rules
, relying instead on informal practices and traditions.
lack of a binding framework creates inconsistencies
in its functioning. For example, there is no guarantee that the Collegium under different Chief Justices of India (CJIs) will adhere to the same standards or priorities.
This ad hoc approach not only undermines predictability but also makes the system vulnerable
to manipulation.
Attempts to Reform the Collegium System and SC Verdict on It
National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act, 2014
sought to replace the
with a commission, for the purpose of appointment and transfer of judges in the
High Courts
of India.
The act aimed to make the process of judicial appointments more transparent and accountable.
However, the
Constitution Bench
(4:1 majority) of the SC struck down the NJAC Act and the 99th Constitutional Amendment as unconstitutional.
The Court reinstated the collegium system, emphasizing the importance of judicial independence.
Proposals to Reform the Collegium System
Introduction of Candidate Interviews
decision to interview candidates for High Court judgeships aims to provide a more holistic evaluation
Interviews can help assess a candidate’s judicial temperament
, ethical outlook, and understanding of constitutional principles, which are not always evident from written records.
This reform can create merit-based appointments
by ensuring that candidates’ skills, perspectives, and values align with the judiciary’s needs.
Addressing Nepotism
By discouraging the selection of candidates with close familial ties to serving judges, the Collegium seeks to enhance diversity and meritocracy in judicial appointments.
This move could break entrenched power structures within the judiciary, opening the door for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including first-generation lawyers and underrepresented communities.
Codification of Collegium Processes
Formalising the Collegium’s functioning through a codified set of rules is essential to ensure consistency and predictability.
A clear framework outlining eligibility criteria
, selection processes, and timelines can
eliminate ambiguities and reduce discretionary decision-making
Codification would bring much-needed structure to the Collegium’s operations, making it more transparent and less susceptible to allegations of arbitrariness.
Time-Bound Approvals
Instituting a fixed timeline for the government
to act on Collegium recommendations
would address delays in judicial appointments.
could include binding deadlines
for either accepting or returning recommendations with detailed reasons.
Such a mechanism would reduce judicial vacancies
, alleviate case backlogs, and improve overall efficiency in the judiciary.
Transparency Through Public Disclosures
Publishing detailed justifications for appointments and rejections could enhance public trust
includes disclosing reasons for selecting certain candidates and rejecting others
, as well as addressing concerns raised during the selection process.
Transparency would not only bolster accountability but also deter frivolous challenges
to the Collegium’s decisions.
Independent Oversight Mechanism
Establishing an independent body to oversee the implementation of Collegium
recommendations and address disputes between the judiciary and the executive could
improve accountability without compromising independence.
Such a body could act as a mediator, ensuring that the judicial appointment process adheres to constitutional principles while resolving conflicts collaboratively.
The Way Forward to Ensure the Success of the Reforms
Comprehensive Consultations:
Engaging stakeholders, including senior judges, legal experts, and civil society, in drafting codified rules to ensure inclusivity and legitimacy.
Capacity Building:
Strengthening administrative infrastructure to handle the additional demands of a reformed appointment process.
Enforcement Mechanisms
: Introducing legal provisions to penalize non-compliance with timelines or procedural lapses by the executive.
Periodic Reviews:
Conducting regular assessments of the Collegium’s functioning to identify and address emerging challenges.
Conclusion
Post the NJAC judgment, the
continues to be the method for appointing judges to the higher judiciary.
The Collegium system,
despite its flaws,
represents an effort to preserve the judiciary’s independence.
However, its survival and efficacy depend on meaningful reforms
that address both structural and procedural deficiencies.

**********Key Facts about Alakananda River
Alaknanda river flowing through the Garhwal region has been identified as ‘most vulnerable to landslide-induced natural dams', according to a recent study conducted by IIT Roorkee researchers in Uttarakhand.
About Alakananda River:
The Alaknanda River is
one of the two main headstreams of the Ganges
River, the
other being the Bhagirathi River.
It
originates from
the meltwaters of the
Satopanth and Bhagirath Kharak glaciers
in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand.
The river is joined by many tributaries in Uttarakhand.
Five of the tributaries are considered major,
and their points of confluence are also worshipped as
Panch Prayag
. They are
listed below:
Vishnuprayag
: Alaknanda meets
Dhauliganga
Nandprayag
meets Nandakini
Karnaprayag
meets Pindar
Rudraprayag
meets Mandakini
Devprayag
meets Bhagirathi
. This is the
most revered
confluence, as it is here when the surging water coming from the mountains are
finally called the Ganga.
At the time of formation of Ganga,
Alaknanda’s contribution
to the flow is
larger than that of Bhagirathi.
From its source till its union with Bhagirathi, Alaknanda travels for
190 km
(approx.).
Along the banks of the Alaknanda are numerous
important pilgrimage sites
such as
Badrinath, Hemkund Sahib, and Joshimath.

**********What are Tidal Tails?
About 430 million light-years away, in the Leo constellation, astronomers have discovered a nascent ultra-diffuse galaxy forming at the tip of a record-breaking tidal tail extending from the galaxy NGC 3785.
About Tidal Tail:
Tidal tails are
thin, elongated regions of stars and interstellar
gas extending into space.
They are typically
formed when galaxies undergo close encounters or mergers
, causing their mutual gravitational forces to distort and stretch out material from their outer regions.
During the interaction,
gas and stars
are often
stripped from the outer regions
of the galaxies to
form two tidal tails
one trailing and one preceding each galaxy.
These tails can
persist long after the galaxies have finally merged
and are therefore considered a
signature of recent merger activity.
Examples of galaxies with tidal tails include the
Tadpole Galaxy and the Mice Galaxies
Tidal forces
can eject a significant amount of a galaxy's gas into the tail.
Within those galaxies which have tidal tails, approximately 10% of the galaxy's stellar formation takes place in the tail.
Overall, roughly
1% of all stellar formation
in the known universe
occurs within tidal tails.
Studying tidal tails helps astronomers understand how galaxies interact, merge, and evolve over cosmic time.

**********Water gushes out from underground in Rajasthan village
Why in news?
Residents of Taranagar village in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, experienced a unique phenomenon from December 27 to December 29, when large amounts of water unexpectedly gushed out from underground. The flow stopped naturally without any external intervention.
Social media speculated the event's connection to the Saraswati River, referenced in ancient texts like the Rig Veda and believed to have flowed through the region in the past. Experts do not consider this to be linked with the Saraswati River. They believe that this water is millions of years old and in no way linked with the river.
What’s in today’s article?
Unexpected Water Flow in Jaisalmer During Tube Well Drilling
Understanding Artesian Aquifers
Artesian Aquifers in the Desert Region
Incident Details
In the Mohangarh area of Jaisalmer, a farmer hired a firm to dig a tube well on December 27.
After reaching a depth of 850 feet, water began gushing out at high pressure, trapping a truck and a drilling machine.
Around 25 bighas of land nearby were submerged due to the water flow, which also created a large pit.
Gas Release
A small amount of non-inflammable gas accompanied the water flow.
Experts Explanation
Geologists at Rajasthan's State Ground Water Department, explained the phenomenon as an
"artesian condition
," where water flows naturally due to underground pressure.
Definition of Artesian Aquifer
:
According to the United States Geological Survey, an
artesian aquifer stores water under pressure between impermeable layers of sediment and soil below the Earth's surface
It is also referred to as “confined” water due to the presence of hardy materials above and below it.
Key Characteristics
Confined Water
: The water is confined in layers of rock or soil, creating pressure that forces it to the surface when tapped.
Natural Flow
: Due to the underground pressure, water can flow freely from the well once it is drilled, often without the need for a pump.
Depth: Artesian wells typically tap into deeper underground sources compared to regular wells.
Formation
Artesian wells are formed when water from a higher elevation is trapped between two impermeable layers, and the pressure from the surrounding rock forces it upward when a hole or well is drilled.
Artesian wells are commonly found in areas with specific geological conditions, and they can provide a steady flow of water for various uses, including irrigation and drinking water.
Difference from Normal Wells
Unlike regular tube wells or wells, artesian water can naturally sprout from underground due to high pressure.
This water is located deeper below the surface and is surrounded by poorly permeable rocks that trap the pressure.
Drilling or rupturing the confining layers releases this pressure, forcing water upward.
Water Confined Under Sandstone Layers
In desert areas, water is trapped beneath a geological layer of sandstone.
When this top layer is punctured, water flows upward due to intense underground pressure.
Unique Observation in Taranagar
While this phenomenon has been seen in places like Mohangarh and Nachana Samiti Panchayat in Rajasthan, the intensity of water flow observed in Taranagar was unprecedented.
Global Occurrence of Artesian Phenomena
Similar artesian conditions have been documented in desert regions of Australia and Africa.

**********US eases curbs to push nuclear deal
Why in news?
The US is finalizing measures to ease regulations hindering civil nuclear cooperation with India, as part of advancing the Indo-US nuclear deal.
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan announced plans to remove Indian government entities, including Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Indira Gandhi Atomic Research Centre (IGCAR), and Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL), from the
US entity list
This move aims to facilitate collaboration between India's nuclear institutions and US companies.
What’s in today’s article?
What is US Entity List?
Indo-US Civil Nuclear Deal
Key Legal Barriers to Indo-US Civil Nuclear Deal
Indo-US Civil Nuclear Collaboration: Opportunities
US eases curbs to push nuclear deal – Key highlights
About
The US Entity List includes foreign individuals, businesses, and organizations subject to export restrictions and licensing requirements for specific goods and technologies.
Purpose of the List
Compiled by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the U.S. Department of Commerce, it aims to prevent unauthorized trade that could support:
Terrorism
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) programs
Activities against US foreign policy or national security interests.
The Indo-US Civil Nuclear Deal, signed in
2008
, marked a watershed moment in India-US relations.
It allowed India to engage in nuclear trade despite not being a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
The agreement granted India access to nuclear fuel, reactors, and technology for civilian purposes while committing to the separation of its civilian and military nuclear programs under IAEA safeguards.
Progress
The deal received initial enthusiasm, leading to amendments in US laws like the Hyde Act to accommodate India's unique status.
India signed agreements with several countries for nuclear fuel and reactor technologies.
However, the operationalization of the agreement has been slow, with limited progress in the construction of nuclear reactors or the flow of significant US investments.
Why Progress Has Been Slow
(discussed separately below)
High Costs
: Setting up nuclear reactors involves significant costs, making nuclear energy less competitive.
Regulatory and Bureaucratic Hurdles
: Long-standing regulatory issues, including delays in clearances and approvals, have hindered progress.
Public Opposition
: Concerns over nuclear safety, particularly after incidents like the Fukushima disaster (2011), have slowed reactor projects due to protests and resistance.
Geopolitical Factors
: Divergences over non-proliferation commitments and strategic priorities, as well as legacy issues in bilateral relations, have created friction.
Technological Constraints in India’s Nuclear Programme
India’s civil nuclear programme primarily relies on Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) using heavy water and natural uranium.
PHWRs are becoming outdated compared to the more widely adopted Light Water Reactors (LWRs), where the US, Russia, and France lead in technology.
US Regulatory Impediments (10CFR810)
Part 810 of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, under the US Atomic Energy Act of 1954, restricts US nuclear vendors from manufacturing equipment or performing nuclear design work in India.
This limitation hinders India’s aspiration to participate in the manufacturing value chain and co-produce nuclear components for joint projects.
India’s Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010
The Act holds suppliers liable for damages in case of a nuclear accident, deterring foreign vendors like GE-Hitachi, Westinghouse, and Orano from investing in India’s nuclear sector.
Concerns about future liability remain a significant hurdle for international players.
The Role of iCET in Strengthening Collaboration
The US-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) aims to address these barriers by fostering innovation and enabling joint manufacturing of nuclear components.
A breakthrough under iCET could facilitate deployment of American atomic reactors in India and enhance mutual cooperation.
India’s Push for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
India is positioning itself as a manufacturing hub for nuclear reactors, particularly SMRs with capacities between 30 MWe and 300 MWe.
SMRs are cost-effective and scalable, making them attractive for global markets, especially in the Global South.
China, however, is actively working to dominate the SMR industry, posing stiff competition to India and the US.
Collaboration in Light Water Reactors (LWRs)
India could gain access to advanced LWR technology, addressing its technological constraints.
The US could leverage India’s cost-efficient manufacturing ecosystem to offset its high labour costs and protectionist policies.
Collaboration could strengthen both nations’ ability to compete with China in the global nuclear reactor market.
US eases curbs to push nuclear deal – Key Highlights
Challenges in Bilateral Relations
Sullivan acknowledged challenges in trade, human rights, and rule of law but emphasized long-term strategic alignment between the two nations.
Reducing Dependency on China
Sullivan criticized China’s “
predatory industrial strategies
” in sectors like chip manufacturing and clean energy.
US companies, including Apple, are diversifying supply chains and expanding into India, with over 25% of iPhones expected to be made in India soon.
Sullivan stressed the importance of India-US collaboration to safeguard critical supply chains and technologies.
Ensuring Dual-Use Technologies’ Security
Sullivan highlighted the need to prevent advanced technologies from falling into the wrong hands, referencing Russia and its S-400 air defence system.
He underscored India-US cooperation for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.

Key findings include:
Identification of 42 base signs, 544 variants, and 1,521 composite forms.
60% of Tamil Nadu signs had parallels in the Indus script, and 90% of graffiti marks in both regions were comparable.
Significance of similarities:
The study, focused on key Tamil Nadu sites like Keeladi, Sivagalai, and Thulukarpatti, suggests:
Evidence of cultural contact between the Indus Valley (Copper Age) and Tamil Nadu (Iron Age).
Possibility of direct or intermediary cultural exchanges, warranting further material evidence.
Political and Cultural Implications of TN CM’s Attempt to Decipher Indus Script:
Dravidian identity and historical reframing:
Stalin’s initiatives aim to
challenge Aryan-centric narratives
by emphasizing:
Tamil Nadu’s parallel development
alongside the Indus Valley Civilisation.
Advanced carbon dating from Keeladi, showing Tamil Brahmi script dates back to 600 BCE,
narrowing the historical gap
Highlighted symbols like the bull, connecting Indus seals to Tamil traditions like
Jallikattu
Broader Dravidian image:
Stalin has actively emphasized Dravidian governance through initiatives like:
Adding “
Belongs to Dravidian Stock
” to his social media profile.
Defining the “
Dravidian Model
” as inclusive growth in governance and budgeting.
Political confrontations:
Stalin’s efforts align with his party’s stance against BJP’s cultural narratives, highlighting Tamil Nadu’s unique cultural heritage and historical significance.
Conclusion:
Stalin’s initiative not only seeks to decipher an ancient script but also asserts Tamil Nadu’s historical significance and cultural identity.
The integration of archaeological findings into political narratives
highlights a broader effort to reshape India’s history from a Dravidian perspective.

**********Decoding the National Anthem Controversy
Polity
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Debate related to national anthem;
Why in the News?
Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi walked out of the Legislative Assembly without giving his opening address for the first session of the year, saying the
was not played before his speech. Last year, he also refused to read his address.
What is the practice followed in the TN Legislative Assembly during and after the Governor’s address?
Governor’s Address Protocol:
Traditionally, the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu (state anthem) is sung at the beginning of the Governor’s address, while the National Anthem is played at the end. This practice was established in July 1991 during the AIADMK government led by Jayalalithaa.
Recent Incident:
Governor R.N. Ravi walked out of the Assembly without delivering his address, citing that only the state anthem was played upon his arrival and not the National Anthem. He expressed that this constituted a disrespect to both the Constitution and the National Anthem.
Is singing the National Anthem mandatory on certain occasions?
Constitutional Duty: Article 51(A)(a)
of the Constitution includes respecting the National Anthem as a
fundamental duty
of every citizen. However, it does not make its singing or playing mandatory on specific occasions.
Government Guidelines:
The
Ministry of Home Affairs’ Orders
specify occasions when the National Anthem must be played, such as during civil and military investitures, parades, arrival/departure of the President or Governor, and ceremonial State functions.
Judicial Clarifications:
The courts have observed that while the National Anthem deserves respect, its singing or playing on all occasions is not mandatory unless explicitly specified.
For instance, during cinema screenings, the Supreme Court ruled that playing the anthem is not obligatory but encouraged.
Can punishment be imposed if it isn’t played at official functions?
Legal Provisions:
Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971
penalizes
deliberate insult or contempt
of the National Anthem with imprisonment up to 3 years, a fine, or both.
Non-playing or non-singing of the anthem does not attract punishment unless it is a willful act of disrespect.
Relevant Case Example:
In 2019, the Madras High Court dismissed a petition seeking punishment for the non-playing of the National Anthem at an official function, citing the lack of a legal mandate to enforce its singing or playing on all occasions.
Why does the government make the national anthem on major government occasions?
Fostering Unity and National Pride
: Playing the National Anthem at significant government events reinforces a sense of collective identity, unity, and patriotism among citizens. It serves as a symbolic reminder of shared national values and aspirations, transcending regional, linguistic, and cultural differences.
Respecting Constitutional Ideals
: Mandating the National Anthem aligns with
of the Constitution, which enshrines the fundamental duty of every citizen to respect the National Anthem.
Its inclusion in major events underscores the importance of honouring national symbols and promoting a culture of respect and accountability in public life.
Way forward:
Establish Uniform Protocols:
The government should issue clear and consistent guidelines for playing the National Anthem at official events to avoid confusion and ensure uniformity across states and institutions.
Promote Awareness and Respect:
Conduct awareness campaigns emphasising the significance of the National Anthem as a unifying symbol, fostering voluntary respect and participation without compulsion or controversy.
Mains PYQ:
Discuss the essential conditions for exercise of the legislative powers by the Governor. Discuss the legality of re-promulgation of ordinances by the Governor without placing them before the Legislature.

**********Indo-US nuclear deal
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
India USA relations;
Why in the News?
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan announced that the US is working to remove long-standing rules that have hindered nuclear cooperation between India’s top nuclear entities and American companies.
What are the legal barriers hindering India’s participation in nuclear manufacturing?
10CFR810 Authorization:
This regulation, part of the US Atomic Energy Act of 1954, restricts US nuclear vendors from manufacturing nuclear equipment or conducting nuclear design work in India.
While it allows for the export of equipment under strict safeguards, it prevents India from engaging in the manufacturing value chain and co-producing nuclear components for atomic power projects.
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010:
This Indian legislation establishes a framework for compensating victims of nuclear accidents and allocates liability to equipment suppliers. This provision raises concerns among foreign companies, such as GE-Hitachi and Westinghouse, regarding potential financial exposure and liability risks, which deters investment in India’s nuclear sector.
How does Indian liability law impact the Indo-US nuclear deal?
Liability Allocation:
The Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010, establishes a framework that assigns strict liability to nuclear operators for damages resulting from nuclear incidents.
This means that operators are primarily responsible for compensation, which is capped at ₹500 crore (approximately USD 60 million), with the central government liable for additional amounts up to 300 million Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) in case of higher damages.
Right of Recourse:
The Act provides operators with a right of recourse against suppliers, which means that operators can seek compensation from suppliers if they incur costs due to an accident.
However, this right is not mandatory and is seen as an enabling clause, leading to concerns among suppliers about their financial exposure in the event of an incident.
Insurance Challenges:
The liability law’s structure creates significant challenges for foreign suppliers in obtaining insurance coverage. Many suppliers require a clear legal cap on liability to insure themselves against potential accidents.
The open-ended nature of liability and the potential for significant financial exposure deter investment from companies like GE-Hitachi and Westinghouse, who are wary of entering a market where they could face unpredictable liabilities.
International Standards Compliance:
The Indian liability framework is viewed as an outlier compared to international norms, which typically channel all liabilities to operators rather than suppliers. This divergence complicates foreign participation in India’s nuclear sector and hinders the operationalization of agreements like the Indo-US nuclear deal.
What steps are being taken to enhance Indo-US cooperation in the nuclear sector?
Removal of Regulatory Barriers
: The US is finalizing steps to ease restrictions that have hindered nuclear collaboration since the 2005 deal, enabling closer ties between Indian entities and US private sector players.
Facilitating Technology Transfer
: The regulatory changes will support the transfer of US nuclear technology to India, boosting India’s clean energy expansion efforts.
Strengthening the iCET Framework
: Emphasis on the US-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) to foster collaboration in nuclear technology and other high-tech sectors like AI and quantum computing.
Addressing Liability Concerns
: Discussions to resolve issues related to India’s nuclear liability laws aim to attract foreign suppliers and enhance investment opportunities in India’s nuclear energy sector.
Way forward:
Policy Reforms for Liability Clarity
: Amend India’s Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act to align with international norms by channelling liability solely to operators, reducing suppliers’ financial risks and encouraging foreign investment.
Promote Joint Ventures and Technology Transfer
: Facilitate joint manufacturing and R&D collaborations under the iCET framework, leveraging US expertise in light water reactor technology and India’s manufacturing capabilities to achieve shared clean energy goals.

HMPV and its causes
Why in the News?
Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV)
has recently become a topic of widespread discussion in India, fueled by sensational media reports. These reports claim the emergence of a “
new dangerous virus
”
from China
, leading to unnecessary public panic and misinformation.
What is Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV)?
) is a
respiratory virus
that primarily causes
mild to moderate respiratory infections
It belongs to the
Paramyxoviridae family
, the same group of viruses that includes respiratory syncytial virus (
RSV
) and parainfluenza.
HMPV was
first identified
2001
and has been circulating globally for decades.
Most infections are mild and self-limiting, but HMPV can cause severe illness in
vulnerable groups
such as:
Elderly individuals.
Young children (especially under five years).
Immunocompromised individuals or those with chronic illnesses.
Transmission:
Spread primarily through
respiratory droplets
, direct contact with contaminated surfaces, or close contact with infected individuals.
Diagnosis:
Advanced
PCR-based respiratory panels
can detect HMPV. However, these tests are not routinely performed unless required in vulnerable patients or during hospital outbreaks.
Symptoms and Treatment for HMPV:
HMPV symptoms overlap with those of other respiratory viruses like influenza and RSV.
Mild Symptoms:
Runny nose; Sore throat; Cough; Fever; Fatigue.
Severe Symptoms (in vulnerable populations):
Bronchitis; Wheezing; Pneumonia; Difficulty breathing; Hypoxia in extreme cases.
No Specific Antiviral or Vaccine:
Unlike flu and RSV, there is no targeted antiviral therapy or vaccine for HMPV.
Supportive Care:
Rest and hydration; Over-the-counter medications to manage fever and pain (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen).
For Severe Cases:
Hospitalization may be required for oxygen therapy, nebulization, or other supportive measures.
Present Scenario- Global and National:
HMPV is one of the leading causes of respiratory infections worldwide, following influenza and RSV.
Studies indicate HMPV accounts for
5-10% of respiratory infections
in children and vulnerable adults annually.
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
recently reported two HMPV cases in Karnataka involving babies with a history of bronchopneumonia.
These are the first cases identified using PCR diagnostic tools after a surge in HMPV cases in China.
