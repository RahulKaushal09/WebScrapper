About Currency Swap Agreement:
A currency swap agreement is a financial contract between two parties to exchange principal and interest payments in different currencies.
The primary purpose of such an agreement is
to secure more favourable loan terms or to hedge against currency risk
Features of currency swap agreement include:
Exchange of Principal
At the start of the swap, the two parties exchange equivalent amounts of different currencies based on the prevailing exchange rate.
For example, Party A might lend Party B USD, while Party B lends Party A an equivalent amount in INR.
Interest Payments
Throughout the duration of the swap, the parties exchange interest payments on the borrowed amounts.
These payments are typically made at regular intervals and are calculated based on the interest rates agreed upon in the swap contract.
The interest payments can be fixed or floating rates.
Re-exchange of Principal
At the end of the swap agreement, the parties re-exchange the principal amounts at the initial exchange rate, regardless of the current exchange rate.
Benefits of Currency Swap Agreements
Hedging
: Companies can hedge against currency fluctuations and interest rate changes.
Access to Capital
: Firms can access capital in foreign currencies at more favourable rates.
Cost Savings
: It can lead to cost savings due to better loan terms in the foreign currency market.
India’s Currency Swap Agreements:
So far, the Commerce Ministry, Government of India, has finalised arrangements with some 23 countries with whom Indian can trade in local currencies.
In simple terms, the importer or exporter in both the countries has to quote and receive settlements in their own currencies.
No third country currency is involved, thereby eliminating the need to worry about exchange variations.
India's emphasis has been to persuade countries to come to this arrangement, where India has substantial or sizeable trade deficit with that country
By doing so, the dues are still payable in rupees, thus saving the need to settle in "foreign exchange" in say, US dollars, Euros, or whatever.
Once the Finance Ministry approves the country with whom such an arrangement would be mutually beneficial, Commerce Ministry takes over the responsibility to start the bilateral talks to arrive at a suitable agreement.
Currency Swap Arrangement for SAARC countries:
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a revised Currency Swap Framework for SAARC countries, effective from
This framework enables bilateral currency swap agreements between the RBI and SAARC central banks to address short-term foreign exchange liquidity needs or balance of payments crises.
A new INR Swap Window with concessions for Indian Rupee support,
totalling ₹250 billion
, has been introduced.
Additionally, a US Dollar/Euro Swap Window with a corpus of $2 billion will continue.
All SAARC member countries can access the facility, provided they sign the bilateral agreements.

**********India Inclusion in JP Morgan EM Bond Index
Why in News?
India officially became part of JP Morgan's Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM). The inclusion is likely to bring nearly $20-25 billion into the country (over the next 10 months) and will help India manage its external finances and boost foreign exchange reserves and the rupee.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Indian Bond Market - Challenges and Solutions
What is the JP Morgan Emerging Market Index?
What was JP Morgan’s Announcement?
Impact of IGBs Inclusion
Will Higher Inflows be a Concern for RBI?
Indian Bond Market - Challenges and Solutions:
Importance of bond markets:
They are a boon for corporate bodies and government entities, providing a
flexible and efficient way to raise capital.
One of the critical advantages for companies is the
avoidance of equity dilution.
Moreover, the cost of capital is reduced as the interest expenses on debt instruments are tax-deductible, making it a more attractive option than other forms of financing.
India's bond market:
India's bond market is pivotal in the country's economic structure.
As of September 2023, the government bond market
size stands impressively at $1.3 trillion
, with corporate bonds at $0.6 trillion.
Challenges in Indian bond markets:
Narrow investment base,
Insufficient participation by foreign investors,
Virtually absent secondary market and
Private placement (a sale of stock shares or bonds to pre-selected investors and institutions rather than publicly on the open market).
Panacea:
Inclusion in the Global Indices
Presence of market makers on both buy and sell-side
No credit default swaps
Bonds bhi ‘Sahi Hain’: A marketing campaign which can catch the eyeballs of all the age groups of the society.
Credit enhancement frameworks
Incentivising the issuer
Created in the early 1990s
, it is the most widely referenced index for emerging market bonds and has become benchmarks for local market and corporate EM bonds.
It began with the issuance of the first Brady bond
- denominated in U.S. dollars and issued by developing countries and backed by the U.S. Treasury bonds.
It has since expanded to include
the GBI-EM (in 2005) and the Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index (CEMBI).
JP Morgan has announced that it would include
Indian Government Bonds (IGBs)
to its emerging markets bond index (starting June 28, 2024).
There are 23 IGBs that meet the index eligibility criteria
, with a combined notional value of approximately Rs 27 lakh crore or $330 billion.
Only IGBs designated under the Fully Accessible Route
(FAR was introduced by the RBI in 2020 to enable non-residents to invest in specified Government of India dated securities) are index-eligible.
Impact of IGBs Inclusion:
India is expected to reach the
maximum weight of 10%
in the GBI-EM Global Diversified Index (GBI-EM GD).
A higher weightage will prompt global investors to
allocate more funds
(~ $ 2-3 billion flows to India every month) for investment in Indian debt.
It will not only result in
lower risk premia
, but will also
help India to finance its fiscal and current account deficit (CAD).
It will also help India to enhance the liquidity and ownership base
of government securities (G-secs; debt instruments issued by the central government to meet its fiscal needs).
The inclusion of certain Indian sovereign bonds will
support a diversification of the investor base
for Indian government securities.
It could help lower funding costs slightly
, and support further development of domestic capital markets.
When the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) removes dollars from the market, it must release an equal amount in rupees.
This means, while higher inflows will boost the rupee, the RBI will have to use the instruments in its armoury
to check the resultant inflationary pressures.

**********SEBI tightens norms on financial influencers, eases rules for delisting
Why in news?
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), India’s markets regulator, has asked brokers and mutual funds to stop using the services of unregulated financial influencers for marketing and advertising campaigns.
In addition to regulating finfluencers, SEBI has introduced a fixed price process for delisting frequently traded shares and established a delisting framework for Investment and Holding Companies (IHC).
What’s in today’s article?
Finfluencers (financial influencers)
New rules by SEBI
About
Finfluencers are people with public social media platforms offering advice and sharing personal experiences about money and investment in stocks.
Their videos cover budgeting, investing, property buying, cryptocurrency advice and financial trend tracking.
Popularity of finfluencers
The popularity of finfluencers is evident from their massive subscriber counts, often exceeding those of leading broking firms.
This has resulted in substantial earnings for the most successful finfluencers, with estimates ranging from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 30 lakh per month.
However, the low barriers to entry in this space have also led to increased exposure to potential bad actors and questionable advice.
Need to regulate finfluencers
There has been a sharp rise in the number of various ‘unregistered’ investment advisors giving unsolicited social media ‘stock’ tips on various social media platforms.
The rise of finfluencers can be attributed to
India's low financial literacy rate of 27%
and the influx of new investors during the Covid-19 pandemic.
With the democratization of trading through new-age broking apps and affordable smartphones, many first-time investors turned to finfluencers for guidance.
However, the lack of financial education and the focus on market updates by business news channels created a vacuum that finfluencers have been filling.
There were also reports that certain companies used social media platforms to boost their share prices through such finfluencers.
Recently, an online portal claimed that finfluencers get paid Rs 7 to 9 lakh per endorsement to push financial products on social media.
There are two important aspects which requires attention:
It is unclear if these influencers have any educational or professional qualification to offer such financial advice, and
If there is any kind of monetary transaction that happens between them and the entity they are promoting.
Criticism
Critics have raised the concerns in this regard. They claim that finflencers render advice to their followers which comes under the
ambit of Freedom of Expression of the Constitution
Followers are not forced to take action based on the recommendations of these finfluencers.
They point towards the fact that often celebrities endorse certain products without having any expertise. Also, they take money to promote the products.
In this context, these critics claim that regulating the finfluencers would be improper.
SEBI Tightens Norms on Financial Influencers
Under the new rules, brokers and mutual funds are prohibited from using the services of unregulated financial influencers for marketing and advertising campaigns.
However, financial influencers engaged in investor education will be exempt from these restrictions.
The regulated entities will be responsible for ensuring that the individuals they associate with adhere to the rules of conduct set by SEBI, including avoiding promises of assured returns.
Changes to Derivative Trading Regulations
SEBI has introduced new criteria to determine which stocks can be linked to derivative products, such as futures and options.
The total number of stocks eligible for derivative trading is expected to increase slightly.
Eased Delisting Rules
The regulator has approved changes to delisting rules, making it easier for companies to exit from stock exchanges.
Currently, delisting is carried out via reverse book-building.
Reverse book-building is primarily used by companies that wish to delist their shares from a stock exchange
The objective is to determine the exit price at which shareholders are willing to sell their shares back to the company or promoters.
Companies can now offer their shareholders fixed prices for shares as an alternative to the current reverse book-building mechanism.
The fixed price must be at least 15% above a floor price, which will be determined by rules set by the regulator.
The regulator has also decided to remove financial disincentives for the managing director and chief technology officer of exchanges and other market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) in the event of technical glitches.

**********Why govt must create a buffer stock of all main food items? 
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
NAFED, Open Market
Mains level:
How Buffer in Chana Helped
Why in the news?
Sales of wheat and chana in the open market have effectively curbed soaring inflation in cereals and pulses.
What is an Open Market?
An open market is an economic system with little to no barriers to free-market activity. An open market is characterized by the absence of tariffs, taxes, licensing requirements, subsidies, unionization, and any other regulations or practices that interfere with free-market activity. Open markets may have competitive barriers to entry, but never any regulatory barriers to entry.
Present State of Inflation:
Overall CPI Inflation:
Stood at 4.75% year-on-year in May, the lowest in 12 months, but food inflation remained elevated at 8.69%.
Cereals and Pulses:
Inflation rates were 8.69% for cereals and 17.14% for pulses in May 2024.
Impact of Buffer Stocks:
Buffer stocks of wheat and chana moderated inflation by ensuring sufficient supply during periods of price volatility.
How Buffer in Gram(Chana) Helped:
NAFED Procurements:
Procured large quantities of chana during surplus years at MSP, preventing prices from soaring during crop failures.
Distribution:
Sold chana through various channels including open market e-auctions and ‘Bharat Dal’ at subsidized rates, stabilizing prices for consumers.
Current Stock Levels:
Despite recent sales, NAFED still maintains a buffer stock of 4.01 lakh tonnes of chana as of now.
Significant Role Played by FCI:
Wheat Offloading:
FCI offloaded a record 100.88 lakh tonnes of wheat in fiscal 2023-24 through open market sales, stabilizing prices and reducing inflation.
Retail Price Management:
Sales under schemes like ‘Bharat Atta’ ensured wheat and cereal inflation was reduced from peak levels earlier in 2023.
Buffer Management:
Despite reduced stocks from previous years, FCI’s interventions have been crucial in managing price volatility in essential commodities.
Need to Adopt Buffer Policy and Better Procurement:
Buffer Stock Strategy:
Proposal to expand buffer stocks beyond rice, wheat, and select pulses to include oilseeds, vegetables, and even milk powder to mitigate price spikes.
Enhanced Procurement:
Advocates for increased procurement during surplus years to build adequate buffer stocks for future market stabilization.
Policy Impact:
Buffer stocking can moderate price volatility influenced by climate change-induced agricultural uncertainties, benefiting both consumers and producers.
Way forward:
Enhanced Diversification of Buffer Stocks:
There is a need to diversify buffer stocks beyond traditional items like rice and wheat to include a broader range of essential commodities such as oilseeds, vegetables, and milk powder. This expansion would help in better managing price spikes and supply shocks across various sectors.
Strengthened Procurement Mechanisms:
Improving procurement strategies during surplus production years is crucial. This involves proactive measures to purchase larger quantities of commodities at minimum support prices (MSPs), ensuring adequate buffer stocks for future market stabilization and price moderation during scarcity periods.
Mains PYQ:
Food Security Bill is expected to eliminate hunger and malnutrition in India. Critically discuss various apprehensions in its effective implementation along with the concerns it has generated in WTO.

**********Interest rates on small savings schemes like PPF, SCSS, and NSC are under review by Modi 3.0 government 
Economics

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Small Savings Schemes
Mains level:
Impact of Stable Interest Rates on Small Savings Schemes
Why in the news?
The central government of India is set to announce the interest rates for various
, including the Public Provident Fund (PPF), Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY), and Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS), for the July-September 2024 quarter by June 30, 2024.
Current Interest Rates and Expected Changes
Current Rate:
7.1%
Expected Rate:
Despite the benchmark 10-year bond yield averaging 7.02% from March to May 2024, which would suggest a rate of 7.27% according to the formula, experts believe the government will likely maintain the status quo.
Reason:
Factors such as controlled inflation, stable 10-year G-Sec yields, and historical precedence of the government not strictly following the recommended formula indicate a low probability of rate hikes.
2. Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS)
8.2%
Unlikely to see significant changes.
With a spread of 100 basis points, the SCSS offers a substantial return, and experts predict the government will maintain existing rates to manage fiscal policies effectively.
3. Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)
8.0%
Expected to remain stable.
The SSY enjoys a spread of 75 basis points. Given the controlled inflation and fiscal policies, a rate hike is not anticipated.
Factors Influencing Interest Rates
Benchmark Yields:
The interest rates for small savings schemes are linked to the yields of 10-year government securities.
Market Conditions:
Prevailing market yields and inflation rates play a crucial role in determining these rates.
Government Policy:
The central government’s fiscal strategy and policies, such as those outlined in the Union Budget, impact decisions on interest rates.
Investor Sentiment and Returns
PPF:
Investors in PPF may feel disappointed due to the stagnation in interest rates despite a slight uptick in benchmark yields. However, PPF still offers tax-free returns under the Exempt-Exempt-Exempt (EEE) status, making it an attractive long-term investment.
SCSS and SSY:
Stability in interest rates ensures a predictable income stream for senior citizens and parents of girl children, maintaining their trust in these schemes.
Government Fiscal Management:
Maintaining the current interest rates helps the government manage its fiscal deficit more effectively. Higher rates would increase the interest burden on the government, especially for widely subscribed schemes like PPF.
Inflation Control:
Stable interest rates reflect the government’s confidence in managing inflation. By not increasing rates, the government signals that it sees inflation as under control, thus aiming to keep borrowing costs stable for both the government and the public.
Market Stability:
Consistent interest rates contribute to market stability. Predictable returns on small savings schemes help in the planning of household finances, ensuring steady savings and investments. This stability can also foster overall economic stability by maintaining consumer confidence.
Conclusion:
Investors in PPF, SCSS, and SSY should prepare for the possibility that interest rates will remain unchanged for the July-September 2024 quarter. While the formula indicates room for an increase in PPF rates, historical trends and expert opinions suggest that the government may maintain the current rates to balance fiscal control and market stability.
Mains PYQ:
Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is necessary for bringing the unbanked to the institutional fiancé fold. Do you agree with this for the financial inclusion of the poorer section of the Indian society? Give arguments to justify your opinion.

**********Controversy over Sengol in Lok Sabha 
History and Art & Culture

From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Sengol and its symbolic importance
Why in the News?
An opposition parliamentarian has demanded the removal of the Sengol from the Lok Sabha, calling it a symbol of
“rajdand/rajtantra (monarchy)”
.This demand has become a point of contention between the government and the Opposition.
What is a Sengol?
sengol
(or
chenkol
) is a royal sceptre symbolizing
kingship, righteousness, justice, and authority
It is a traditional
Chola-era symbol
of authority and governance, originally from Tamil Nadu.
golden sceptre
, richly adorned and crafted with intricate designs, reflecting the grandeur of ancient Tamil culture.
Among the
Madurai Nayakas
, the sengol was
placed before the goddess Meenakshi
in the temple and then transferred to the throne room, representing the king’s role as a divine agent.
Significance in the present context:
Accountability and Legitimacy:
Just as the Sengol legitimized ancient rulers by holding them accountable to higher moral standards, the institutions and practices in a parliamentary democracy ensure that elected representatives are accountable to the constitution and the people.
Ethical Leadership:
Leaders in a democracy are expected to uphold justice, integrity, and the rule of law, much like the dharmic kings of the past.
Symbolic Representation:
The Sengol, as a symbol of righteous rule, parallels the symbolic importance of democratic institutions that represent the will and welfare of the people.
1947 Sengol Ceremony Involving Nehru
Government’s Claim
: The government claims C Rajagopalachari suggested the ceremony to Nehru.
This claim is debated, as there is little contemporary evidence to support the Sengol being a key symbol of power transfer in 1947.
Lack of Comprehensive Records
: There are limited records about the ceremony where Nehru was reportedly handed a sengol by Hindu leaders from Tamil Nadu.
Undocumented
: The event is not widely documented, and claims of Lord Mountbatten handing it over ceremonially seem exaggerated.
No Symbolization
: Nehru accepted the Sengol as a mark of honor, but it was later placed in a museum, indicating it was not central to the transfer of power.

Financial Stability Report, FSDC
Why in the News?
The Reserve Bank of India has released the
29th issue of the Financial Stability Report (FSR)
.
About Financial Stability Report:
The FSR is published
biannually
by the RBI.
It reflects the collective assessment of the Sub-Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC – headed by the Governor of RBI) on risks to financial stability and the resilience of the financial system.
The Report also discusses issues relating to the development and regulation of the financial sector.
Key Highlights of the FSR
[1] Global Economic Context
Heightened Global Risks
: The global economy faces significant challenges, such as:
Geopolitical Tensions
: Conflicts or political disagreements between countries that can affect global stability.
Elevated Public Debt
: Many countries owe large amounts of money, which can be risky if they struggle to repay it.
Slow Progress in Disinflation
: Prices of goods and services are not decreasing quickly, which can affect economic stability.
Resilience
: Despite these challenges, the global financial system (how money moves around the world) remains strong and stable.
[2] Indian Economy and Financial System
Robust and Resilient
: India’s economy and financial system are strong and able to handle shocks or problems.
Banking Sector Support
: Banks and financial institutions (like insurance companies) are in good health and are lending money to support economic activities.
[3] Financial Metrics for Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs)
Capital Ratios
Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR)
: This is a measure of a bank’s financial strength. A CRAR of 16.8% means that for every 100 units of risk, the bank has 16.8 units of capital to cover potential losses.
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio
: This is a stricter measure of a bank’s core capital. A CET1 ratio of 13.9% means the bank has a strong base of high-quality capital.
Asset Quality
Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) Ratio
