What is Euthanasia?
The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a plea in seeking passive euthanasia for rabies patients.
About Euthanasia:
Euthanasia is defined as the
hastening of death of a patient
to prevent further suffering.
The term "euthanasia" comes from the Greek phrase "eu thanatos", in which "eu" means "good" and "thanatos" translates into "death." Literally speaking, the maxim
translates to "easy death".
The practice of euthanasia can be classified into the following
two categories:
Active Euthanasia:
Active euthanasia is a method that involves
taking active steps to end a life.
This involves taking positive steps to end a patient's life,
such as by administering
them a dose of
medication
through their intravenous line
that will kill them.
Active euthanasia is also sometimes
referred to by the term "aggressive euthanasia”.
Passive Euthanasia:
Passive Euthanasia is defined as the
deliberate act of causing someone's death by withholding or withdrawing artificial life support,
such as a ventilator, from a patient who is terminally ill.
In a case like this,
something that is essential to save a patient’s life is not done.
Legality in India:
In a landmark ruling in the
Common Cause vs. Union of India case (2018),
a five-judge Constitution bench of the
Supreme Court recognised the right to die as part of the right to life,
legalising
permitting the creation of a “living will”
for terminally ill patients or those in a persistent vegetative state
with no hope of recovery, ensuring a dignified exit by refusing medical treatment or life support.
However, in India,
active euthanasia is illegal and a crime.

**********What is Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)?
The Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech group company, Biovet, recently announced that its Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) vaccine for dairy cattle and buffaloes, Biolumpivaxin, has received a license from the Central Drug Standards Control Organization (CDSCO).
About Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD):
It is an
infectious viral disease of cattle
and water buffalo.
It is caused by the
lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV
), which belongs to the genus
capripoxvirus
, a part of the
poxviridae
family (smallpox and monkeypox viruses are also a part of the same family).
LSDV is
not zoonotic
, so humans cannot get infected by the virus.
Originally found in Africa,
it has also spread to countries in the
Middle East, Asia, and eastern Europe.
LSD is a highly
host-specific disease
. It
primarily affects cows
and to a
lesser
extent, buffalo.
Morbidity rate is higher in cattle
than buffalo.
The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides and, occasionally, death.
Transmission:
It is transmitted by
blood-feeding insects
, such as certain species of flies, mosquitoes, or ticks.
Infected animals shed the virus
through oral and nasal secretions, which may
contaminate common feeding and water troughs.
Thus, the disease can either spread through direct contact with the vectors or through contaminated fodder and water.
Symptoms
The disease is characterized by
high fever
enlarged superficial lymph node
on the skin
and peculiar multiple nodules or
lumps on the skin.
It can
also lead to death,
especially in animals that have not previously been exposed to the virus or have low immunity.
Treatment
There is
no treatment
for the virus, so
prevention by vaccination
is the most effective means of control.
The infected animals receive supportive care, which involves the use of antibiotics, painkillers, and wound care sprays to treat symptoms.

**********Centre vs Delhi Government: The Constitutional Tussle
What’s in Today’s Article?
Introduction (Context of the Article, Constitutional Status of Delhi)
Centre vs Delhi Government (Legal Issues, Central Government's Legislative Response, etc.)
Introduction:
The governance of
, India's national capital, has been a contentious issue for years, leading to a
continuous legal battle between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi Government and the BJP-led Central Government
The primary conflict revolves around
Delhi’s unique constitutional status
, which places it under a special category as a
Union Territory (UT) with a legislature
The struggle over administrative control, particularly over
bureaucratic appointments, law enforcement, and governance powers
, has led to several Supreme Court (SC) interventions and amendments in governance laws.
Constitutional Status of Delhi:
Delhi’s governance is defined by
Article 239AA
Indian Constitution
, introduced through the
Sixty-Ninth Constitutional Amendment Act (1991)
. This article provides Delhi with:
Legislative Assembly
with the power to make laws on subjects from the
State List
Concurrent List
, except
police, public order, and land
An
elected Chief Minister (CM) and a Council of Ministers
responsible for day-to-day administration.
Lieutenant Governor (L-G)
, appointed by the
President of India
, who acts as the
Centre’s representative
in Delhi.
This division of powers has frequently
led to conflicts over jurisdiction, policy decisions, and administrative control
Legal Battles Between Centre and Delhi Government:
The 2015 Notification and Initial Conflict
When
AAP returned to power in Delhi in 2015
, the
Union Home Ministry issued a notification
giving the
L-G control over bureaucratic services, land, police, and public order
Delhi Government challenged this decision in the High Court
, arguing that the
elected government should have authority over services and administration
Supreme Court Verdicts on Delhi’s Powers
The legal battle escalated to the
, leading to multiple
landmark rulings
2016 Delhi High Court Ruling
Delhi HC ruled in favor of the Centre
, stating that the
L-G had overriding powers over Delhi
This decision effectively
curtailed the Delhi Government’s autonomy
2018 Supreme Court Judgment
five-judge Constitution Bench ruled in favour of the Delhi Government
. It declared that:
L-G must act on the "aid and advice" of the elected government
except in matters of
public order, land, and police
The Delhi Government has
legislative and executive control over other subjects, including administrative services
2023 Supreme Court Verdict
second Constitution Bench reaffirmed the 2018 ruling
, clarifying that:
Delhi Government has control over administrative services
matters related to law enforcement and land
Centre’s argument that no UT has control over services was rejected
Despite these
Supreme Court victories
Central Government introduced amendments to limit Delhi’s powers
Central Government's Legislative Response:
Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2023
May 2023
Centre passed an amendment
to override the Supreme Court’s ruling. This amendment:
Extended the L-G’s power over appointments and transfers of bureaucrats
Created a
new authority
comprising the
Delhi CM, Chief Secretary, and Home Secretary
, where the CM can be
vetoed by bureaucrats
Delhi Government challenged this amendment in the Supreme Court
, arguing it
violates the principles of federalism
Governance Crisis and Political Fallout:
Impact of Legal Battles on Delhi’s Administration
The governance crisis has
delayed policymaking and project implementation
AAP has accused the
Centre of obstructing development programs and administrative reforms
Political Context and Future Implications
With
BJP set to take power in Delhi in 2025
, the legal challenges might
lose momentum
Centre’s increased control over Delhi’s administration may continue
, affecting
AAP’s ability to govern freely
The Supreme Court is yet to give a final ruling on the 2023 amendment, which could determine the future balance of power in Delhi.
Conclusion:
Centre vs Delhi Government conflict is a constitutional, legal, and political issue
that has shaped governance in the national capital.
multiple Supreme Court rulings in favor of Delhi’s autonomy
Centre has used legislative amendments to assert control
over key administrative functions.
legal and political struggle continues
, with
implications for the broader question of federalism in India
As the case progresses, it will set a
precedent for the governance of Union Territories with legislatures, such as Puducherry and Jammu & Kashmir

**********India Braces for Steel Dumping, Price Wars Amid Trump’s 25% Tariff
Why in news?
Trump announced a 25% tariff on all foreign
steel
and aluminium imports, including from allies like Canada and Mexico. He also plans to introduce reciprocal tariffs later in the week.
This move follows previous tariff hikes on Chinese goods and threats against Europe, Taiwan, and key industries.
Indian metal stocks reacted sharply to this news, with the Nifty Metal index falling 3%, while Tata Steel and JSW Steel saw declines of 4%. Investors fear reduced export competitiveness and shrinking revenues for Indian metal producers.
What’s in today’s article?
India Fears Steel Price Pressure Amid Trump’s Fresh Tariff Threat
Canada & Brazil Face Direct Impact; India Less Affected
Potential Global Retaliation
Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty
India’s Concerns Amid Trump’s Fresh Tariff Threat
US President Donald Trump’s renewed threat of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium has raised concerns among Indian companies about downward pressure on domestic steel prices due to reduced access to the US market.
Rising Steel Imports and Dumping Concerns
There are concerns over dumping with steel imports already on the rise.
Higher tariffs may divert Asian steel exports to India, intensifying competition and pushing domestic prices downward.
In 2018, when the U.S. last imposed such tariffs, countries exporting steel to the U.S. were forced to seek alternative markets, flooding India with excess supply.
This led to price drops and significant losses for domestic producers.
Small Indian producers could suffer from low-cost Chinese dumping, requiring India to tread cautiously in its trade policies.
Indian Steel Producers to Face Export Challenges
Moody’s Ratings warned that Indian steelmakers will struggle to export following the US decision to impose an additional 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports.
The new US tariffs will intensify competition and worsen oversupply in global steel markets, further challenging Indian steel exports.
Global Overcapacity Threatens Indian Manufacturing
Countries like China, Japan, and South Korea face significant overcapacity in steel production.
China, in particular, has shifted from long to flat products, increasing exports worldwide, which poses a risk to India’s domestic steel sector.
Ripple Effects on Indian Steel Exports
Past US tariffs led to trade diversions, with Chinese steel exports shifting towards Europe, prompting the EU to impose import restrictions that negatively impacted Indian exports.
Experts warn that the new tariffs could once again disrupt the global stainless steel market.
Rupee Under Pressure
The Indian rupee is expected to weaken further due to market uncertainty and potential disruptions in trade.
Analysts predict increased currency volatility in the coming weeks.
The US imports most of its steel from Canada, Brazil, and Mexico, with South Korea and Vietnam also being significant suppliers.
Canada alone accounted for 79% of US primary aluminum imports in the first 11 months of 2024.
India’s Limited Exposure
India’s primary steel exports to the US in 2024 amounted to $450 million, while aluminium exports reached $820 million.
Steel pipes, tubes, and related products had minimal exports, totalling just $2.83 million,
indicating limited direct impact from the new tariffs
Experts warned that major exporters like China, South Korea, Japan, and the EU might introduce countermeasures if the tariffs take effect.
The EU had previously retaliated against similar US tariffs in 2018 by imposing duties on American goods.
India’s metal industry must prepare for market volatility.
Strategies like supply chain diversification, domestic demand growth, and government intervention
may help mitigate the impact.
Indian steelmakers are advocating for higher import duties (from 7.5% to 15%) to curb excessive imports.
The government is considering expanding production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for domestic manufacturing.
With steel imports already increasing, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry launched a safeguard duty investigation.
A safeguard duty is a type of customs duty imposed by emergency action under the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.
It is designed to prevent harm and injury to a domestic industry that would face intense competitive pressure from the continued importation of a particular good.

Editorial Analysis
**********The Problem of Regulating Live-in Relationships
Context
implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in Uttarakhand marks a significant shift in the governance of civil life
, particularly concerning live-in relationships.
code mandates the compulsory registration of opposite-sex live-in relationships
and criminalises non-compliance.
While some aspects of this regulation aim to safeguard the rights of individuals involved in such relationships,
others raise concerns regarding personal autonomy, privacy, and state interference.
The Primary Motivation Behind Regulating Live-in Relationships: Protection of Vulnerable Parties
One of the primary motivations behind regulating live-in relationships is
the protection of vulnerable individuals, particularly women and children.
UCC grants legitimacy to children born from live-in relationships, extending them legal recognition
that was previously available only to those born from void or voidable marriages.
Furthermore,
the law provides a legal remedy of maintenance in cases
where a partner is deserted.
These provisions reflect a well-intentioned attempt to ensure financial security
for individuals who may otherwise find themselves in precarious situations.
Drawbacks of Uttarakhand UCC
However, the
law falls short in offering support in cases where a live-in relationship is terminated rather than abandoned.
Since termination merely requires a statement to the registrar
, a partner may be left without recourse for financial support.
This gap in the legal framework exposes a fundamental contradiction:
while the law seeks to protect individuals in live-in relationships, it simultaneously upholds their informal nature, failing to provide necessary safeguards post-separation.
Additionally,
the exclusion of same-sex relationships from these provisions further highlights the law's limitations.
By recognising only opposite-sex live-in relationships, the UCC leaves LGBTQ+ individuals without legal protection,
reinforcing social and legal discrimination against non-heteronormative relationships.
Some Other Problematic Aspects of Uttarakhand UCC Law
The Problematic Definition of Live-in Relationships
The UCC's definition of a live-in relationship is
vague and overbroad
, borrowing from the Protection of Women from
Domestic Violence Act, 2005
, which describes them as being “in the nature of marriage.”
many live-in relationships do not resemble marriages
. Some may be transient, while others may not involve economic interdependence or domestic responsibilities.
requirement to register a live-in relationship within one month fails to acknowledge the fluid nature of such arrangements.
Unlike marriages,
live-in relationships often evolve gradually without a clear starting point.
By imposing strict registration requirements, the law may compel individuals to formalise relationships
that do not fit within traditional legal definitions, leading to unnecessary bureaucratic complications.
Violation of Sexual Autonomy and Privacy
A major concern with the UCC's provisions is
its infringement on an individual’s right to sexual autonomy and privacy.
The Supreme Court of India, in
Shakti Vahini v. Union of India (2018), affirmed an adult’s right to make autonomous decisions regarding sexual relationships.
, however,
introduces measures that could enable family and societal interference
in personal choices.
For instance,
if one or both partners in a live-in relationship are below the age of 21, the law mandates that their parents or guardians be informed.
provision not only violates an individual’s right to privacy but also places them at risk, especially in cases of inter-caste or inter-religious relationships
, where parental disapproval can lead to honour-based violence.
provision fails to recognise the reality that young adults, though legally permitted to engage in consensual sexual relationships
, may face coercion and violence from their families due to social and cultural prejudices.
Treating Live-in Relationship as Law-and-Order Issue
the requirement that information about live-in relationships be shared with the local police is another troubling aspect.
Such a move
suggests that live-in relationships are a law-and-order issue
rather than a matter of personal choice.
Criminalising non-registration further strengthens state control over private lives
, reinforcing the notion that the government can dictate the legitimacy of personal relationships.
A Misguided Approach to Relationship Regulation
Globally, jurisdictions that regulate non-marital cohabitation typically do so to extend legal protections and benefits
similar to those of marriage, such as inheritance rights, joint property ownership, and healthcare access.
the Uttarakhand UCC seems to approach live-in relationships not as a legitimate form of partnership
but as a problem requiring state control.
enforcing mandatory registration and criminalizing non-compliance, the UCC moves away from a rights-based approach
and instead imposes unnecessary restrictions on personal freedom.
Instead of empowering individuals
subjects them to greater legal scrutiny and potential societal backlash.
Conclusion
While Uttarakhand’s UCC aims to provide legal safeguards for individuals in live-in relationships, its provisions raise significant concerns
regarding autonomy, privacy, and state interference.
mandatory registration requirement
, parental notification clauses, and criminalisation of non-compliance
undermine the principles of sexual autonomy and personal freedom.
Instead of ensuring protection,
the law risks exposing individuals to greater vulnerability by legitimising societal control over private relationships.
Moving forward,
a more nuanced legal framework is needed, one that balances protection with personal liberties, recognising the diverse nature of modern relationships
without excessive state intrusion.

Editorial Analysis
**********India as a Bridge between the Global North and South
Context
India’s recent diplomatic moves indicate a renewed ambition
to champion the interests of the Global South.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speeches at the 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention
and the 3rd Voice of Global South Summit
highlight India’s commitment to fostering an inclusive global governance structure.
Unlike its past involvement in the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM),
India’s current approach does not focus on decolonisation or Western opposition
but seeks to establish itself as a bridge between the Global North and the Global South.
The question arises:
What has driven India’s proactive stance, and how can it effectively influence global development?
Motivations Behind India’s Engagement with the Global South
The China Factor
Several factors contribute to India’s growing enthusiasm
in global governance,
particularly in championing the interests of developing nations.
A frequently cited explanation is
India’s strategic competition with China.
Given China’s dominant presence in Africa and Asia through infrastructure investments and financial assistance,
India is keen to present an alternative development model.
Unlike China’s state-led, loan-driven approach,
India emphasises equal partnerships and sustainable growth.
Moreover,
industrialised countries appear to be supporting India in counterbalancing China’s expanding global influence, as seen in alliances like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue
(Quad) between India, the United States, Japan, and Australia.
India’s Aspiration to Become a Self-Reliant Power
However,
India’s aspirations are not solely based on geopolitical rivalry.
It seeks to establish itself as a
self-reliant power advocating for fairer economic structures.
Many developing nations face economic struggles due to debt burdens
and policy conditionalities imposed by international financial institutions.
India positions itself as a leader that understands these concerns,
given its own development trajectory.
This
nuanced approach differentiates India from both China and Western powers
, making it a viable candidate for leadership within the Global South.
Steps India Must Take to Strengthen Its Global Role
Redefining Development Cooperation
must reinforce its commitment to a bottom-up development approach
rather than replicating traditional donor-recipient models.
While its recently launched ‘
Global Development Compact’ aims to support growth in the Global South, it is largely shaped by Indian experiences.
To be truly effective,
India should move beyond a unilateral approach and engage in collaborative learning with partner nations.
Countries are more likely to embrace India’s leadership if they see it as an equal partner rather than a dominant force.
A Human-Centric Development Model
India’s promotion of sustainable development through initiatives like Mission
LiFE (‘Lifestyle for Environment’)
is commendable, but it must expand its definition of human-centric progress.
Beyond sustainability,
India should focus on building human capital through skill development, entrepreneurship
, and capacity-building programs.
Programs such as Skill India and initiatives for integrating women into the workforce can be tailored to other developing nations
seeking to strengthen their domestic industries.
India’s experience in developing micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) offers valuable lessons
for other economies.
By sharing knowledge on digital infrastructure, climate solutions, and food security,
India can establish long-term development partnerships rather than short-term engagements.
Institutional Strengthening and Global Governance Reform
India has taken notable steps toward reforming international governance structures.
Its advocacy for the African Union’s inclusion in the G-20 in 2023 exemplifies its commitment
to amplifying the voices of the Global South.
to emerge as a credible global development partner, India must also invest in building its own institutional capacities.
Relying solely on external partnerships, such as those with the United Nations or European countries, may be a short-term necessity, but in the long run,
India needs robust domestic mechanisms to lead global initiatives independently.
Engaging in trilateral partnerships with experienced global actors can serve as a valuable learning opportunity
to refine India’s approach to development cooperation
The Way Forward
As India aspires to become a stronger global development player,
it must establish norms, standards and systems to work with partner countries.
Initially,
it is beneficial to use existing institutional channels of partners such as the United Nations or Germany and France
that are more experienced in development cooperation.
the long-term goal should be for India to create its own robust domestic systems for international cooperation.
Trilateral partnerships and increased engagement with new partners need to be seen as a learning by doing process,
where India imbibes its experiences to scale up India-led global initiatives.
Conclusion
India stands at a pivotal moment in global politics
, where it has the opportunity to redefine its role as a leader of the Global South.
By positioning itself as an advocate for more inclusive economic structures
, promoting a human-centric development model, and strengthening its institutional frameworks,
India can emerge as an effective global development partner.
However, for India to be the ‘Voice’ of the Global South, it must also ‘listen’—ensuring that its policies align with the needs and aspirations

Today’s editorial talks about issues in the Middle East which is always in the news because of the Israel and Palestine conflict. This topic is also the favourite of UPSC in GS Paper2 mains and prelims related to International relations above mentioned in the box (
PYQ Relevance)
. This content would help in substantiation of answers in Mains GS Paper 2.
_
Let’s learn!
Why in the News?
Donald Trump recently proposed an audacious plan to relocate 2.3 million residents of the
Gaza Strip to Egypt and Jordan
, turning Gaza into a global resort, which has stirred geopolitical tension.
This suggestion, along with his praise for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), hints at possible changes in the
West Asia region
, especially concerning the Israel-Palestine issue and Saudi Arabia’s potential involvement in the
Abraham Accords.
What is meant by Trump’s ‘expanding the canvas’ strategy?
Trump’s “expanding the canvas” strategy refers to his approach of broadening the scope of a negotiation or conflict resolution by introducing bold, often extreme proposals to provoke reaction and stimulate further discussions.
By presenting an audacious or exaggerated idea, he aims to shift the focus and push opposing parties to consider more realistic and agreeable counter-offers. The idea is that this “shock tactic” can help break a stalemate and create space for new solutions.
In the context of the Gaza proposal, Trump’s suggestion to depopulate Gaza and turn it into a global resort serves as an example of this strategy—pushing the boundaries of negotiation to force other stakeholders to come up with a more balanced, practical solution.
What are the implications of the proposed strategy for the Gaza conflict, and how might it reshape the geopolitical landscape in West Asia?
Geopolitical Tensions and Pushback:
This proposal would likely anger Palestinians and Arab nations, as it bypasses the core issue of Palestinian statehood and self-determination. It could worsen tensions between Israel, Palestinians, and neighboring Arab countries.
The suggestion might also be viewed as a land grab or colonial move, particularly because it disregards the established claim of Palestinians to their land, creating significant backlash in the region and beyond.
Impact on Palestinian Statehood:
Trump’s plan shifts focus away from the two-state solution (Israel and Palestine coexisting as separate states), which many international actors, including the U.S. and the UN, support.
The proposal undermines the push for Palestinian independence and could derail efforts to achieve a lasting peace settlement.
Saudi Arabia and Other Arab Nations’ Involvement:
Trump’s proposal could alter the balance in Arab-Israeli relations. Saudi Arabia, which is being courted for inclusion in the Abraham Accords, might find it difficult to reconcile such a plan with its own stance on Palestinian rights, especially since Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has linked normalization with Israel to the creation of a Palestinian state.
It could either push Saudi Arabia and other Arab states further toward Israel or create more division, depending on how the proposal is received by the region’s leaders.
Shifting Regional Alliances:
If Saudi Arabia were to move toward accepting the proposal, it could signal a significant shift in Middle Eastern alliances, possibly leading to greater cooperation between Arab states and Israel, while sidelining Palestinian aspirations for statehood.
On the other hand, if the plan fails, it could deepen regional divisions, particularly between Israel and the Arab world, and intensify the existing geopolitical instability in the region.
How are the ongoing conflicts and economic challenges in West Asia affecting the region’s future?
Political Impact of Conflicts:
The wars and conflicts in places like Gaza, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon have created deep divisions and instability. The region has been repolarized, leading to less cooperation and more distrust between nations.
Issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Iran’s nuclear ambitions, and Kurdish national aspirations remain unresolved, keeping tensions high and preventing lasting peace.
Economic Challenges:
The conflicts have caused massive destruction, with the rebuilding costs in places like Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. However, economic recovery is impossible without resolving the political issues first.
The region’s economy is also heavily dependent on oil, which is a vulnerable resource. The global push to move away from fossil fuels and the volatility of oil prices make the region’s future uncertain.
Countries like Saudi Arabia are aware of this and are trying to diversify their economies, but this process is slow.
What are the Abraham Accords?
The Abraham Accords refer to a series of normalization agreements between Israel and several Arab countries, aimed at establishing diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations. These agreements were
brokered by the USA
, and they marked a significant shift in
Middle Eastern geopolitics
Here are the four major features of the Abraham Accords:
Normalization of Relations:
Israel established diplomatic ties with Arab countries like UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco.
Economic Collaboration:
The signatories are working together to enhance trade relations, investment opportunities, and economic partnerships. Israel’s advanced technology sector, including cybersecurity and innovation, is seen as a valuable area for collaboration with the Arab countries.
Security Cooperation:
Enhances defense and intelligence sharing, especially to address regional threats like Iran. As part of the normalization, the Accords encourage cultural exchange programs, tourism, and people-to-people connections.
Exclusion of the Palestinian Issue:
One of the most notable features—and points of controversy—of the Abraham Accords is that the agreements were made without resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
While Palestinian leaders and many in the Arab world have opposed the Accords, claiming they betray the Palestinian cause, the agreements were framed as separate tracks that do not require the resolution of Palestinian statehood for Arab-Israeli relations to normalize.
Saudi Arabia’s Role in Shaping Stability:
Economic Influence:
Saudi Arabia, as the largest economy in the region, plays a major role in the economic stability of West Asia. It has massive reserves of wealth, particularly from its oil exports, and is using this to invest in rebuilding and diversifying the region’s economy. The Saudi Public Investment Fund, for example, is helping to fuel new development projects.
Diplomatic Influence:
Saudi Arabia’s political influence is also crucial. Under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), the country has made efforts to mediate regional conflicts, like the war in Yemen and tensions with Iran. It has also sought to balance relationships with global powers, including the U.S., China, and Russia, while maintaining its leadership role in the Arab and Islamic world.
Potential to Guide Regional Stability:
Despite the conflicts around it, Saudi Arabia has largely avoided direct involvement in the region’s major wars. It can use its wealth and diplomatic leverage to fund reconstruction efforts and push for more peaceful, negotiated solutions to ongoing conflicts. It also holds significant sway over organizations like OPEC, which can affect the global oil market and, by extension, the region’s economy.
What are the challenges the US faces in advancing the Abraham Accords, and how does it  complicate vision for broader Arab-Israeli normalization?
Palestinian Statehood and the Core Issue of the Conflict:
The Palestinian issue is a major barrier to Arab-Israeli normalization, with many Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, insisting on a Palestinian state as a prerequisite.
Trump’s focus on individual peace deals with Arab states bypasses this issue, making it difficult for countries like Saudi Arabia to fully normalize relations with Israel.
Opposition from Palestinian Leaders and Supporters:
The Palestinian leadership has consistently rejected the Abraham Accords, seeing them as a betrayal of their cause. They argue that normalizing relations with Israel without addressing Palestinian rights and the establishment of a Palestinian state undermines their struggle for sovereignty and independence.
This complicates the situation. As long as Palestinians feel excluded from peace processes or see no meaningful progress toward a state of their own, it will be difficult to secure broad Arab-Israeli normalization.
Resistance from Ultra-Religious Israeli Groups:
Within Israel, the growing influence of ultra-religious Jewish groups also complicates Trump’s plans. These groups often oppose any peace deal and their influence makes it harder for the Israeli government to adopt policies that could lead to broader peace agreements, even with Arab states.
Competing Interests Among Arab States:
While some Arab states like the UAE and Bahrain have embraced the Abraham Accords, others, particularly in the Gulf, have been more cautious.
Saudi Arabia, for example, has signaled interest in normalizing relations with Israel, but only on the condition that Palestinian statehood is part of the deal.
This puts Trump in a difficult position, as he must balance the desire to expand the Accords with the realities of Arab and Palestinian demands.
Way Forward:
Need for Revised Diplomacy
: A lasting solution must address Palestinian statehood, with a two-state solution being central to gaining support from Arab nations and Palestinian leaders. Direct negotiations, backed by international mediators, are crucial.
Arab states, Israel, and global powers must work together through multilateral platforms, with Saudi Arabia playing a key role in fostering peace and stability in the region.
Humanitarian Focus
: Immediate efforts are needed to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and surrounding areas, with international aid supporting reconstruction and stability.
Economic Diversification
: The region must move beyond oil dependency by investing in other industries, with collaboration between the U.S. and Gulf states to promote long-term economic stability.
**********India as a bridge between the Global North and South
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Issues related to Global South; Role of India;
Why in the News?
At the 18th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (2025) and the 3rd Voice of Global South Summit (2024), PM of India emphasised India’s leadership in advocating inclusive global governance and amplifying the Global South’s voice.
How can India effectively bridge the divide between the Global North and South?
Alternate Paradigm of Development Cooperation:
India needs to reinforce its call for an alternative development cooperation model that is not solely top-down and dictated by the Global North. It should focus on equal partnerships, but avoid an “India-first” approach, being open to learning from other Global South countries to address domestic challenges.
Human-Centric Approach:
India has partnered with countries like
UAE, Japan, and Saudi Arabia
under agreements like the
India-UAE Skill Harmonization Initiative
, ensuring Indian workers are trained to meet global skill standards. This model can be expanded to Global South nations, helping them create
skilled labour forces
for industrial growth.
Advocating for Inclusive Global Governance:
India can push for reforms in international institutions like the UN, WTO, IMF, and World Bank to better represent Global South interests.
Example
: India championed the inclusion of the
African Union in the G20
during its presidency in 2023, making the grouping more representative.
Learning and Listening:
India needs to listen to the Global South to be a good leader, using trilateral partnerships and increased engagement with new partners as a learning process to scale up India-led global initiatives.
What are the key priorities and concerns of the Global South that India can champion?
Debt Relief and Fair Financial Structures:
Many developing nations are burdened by unsustainable debt, often due to high-interest loans from global financial institutions and major lenders like China.
: India has advocated for debt restructuring in international forums like the G20 and supports initiatives like the Common Framework for Debt Treatment to assist Global South nations.
Climate Justice and Sustainable Development:
The Global South demands climate finance, technology transfer, and a fair transition to clean energy without compromising growth.
: India spearheaded the
International Solar Alliance (ISA)
to help developing nations access affordable solar energy and pushed for climate finance commitments at COP summits.
Equitable Global Trade and Market Access:
Many Global South nations struggle with restricted market access, unfair subsidies in developed countries, and dependence on primary commodity exports.
: India has advocated for WTO reforms, sought duty-free access for developing countries’ exports, and promoted initiatives like ‘Make in Africa’ to reduce dependency on Western economies.
Food and Energy Security:
Rising food and fuel prices disproportionately impact Global South nations, making self-sufficiency in agriculture and energy a key concern.
: India’s
export of wheat and rice
during global food crises and partnerships in biofuel development, such as the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), help address these concerns.
Technology and Digital Inclusion:
The digital divide limits economic opportunities in many developing nations, making access to digital infrastructure and AI-driven solutions crucial.
Aadhaar-based digital public infrastructure
and UPI payment system have been shared with countries like Sri Lanka and Mauritius, promoting financial inclusion and governance reforms.
How can India balance its relationships with both to foster unified solutions? (Way forward)
Strategic Multi-Alignment:
India follows a multi-aligned foreign policy, maintaining strong ties with the U.S. and Europe while deepening its engagement with Global South nations.
: India’s participation in the Quad (with the U.S., Japan, and Australia) while simultaneously leading the Voice of Global South Summits showcases its balancing act.
Leveraging Common Agendas:
India identifies shared global challenges like climate change, digital transformation, and healthcare to foster collaboration between developed and developing nations.
: India played a key role in securing climate finance commitments for developing countries during its G20 presidency in 2023, aligning Global South needs with Global North priorities.
Soft Power and Cultural Diplomacy:
India uses its democratic values, historical non-alignment stance, and rich cultural heritage to maintain trust across geopolitical divides.
: India’s expansion of diplomatic missions in Africa, the International Solar Alliance (ISA), and Yoga Diplomacy have helped strengthen relationships across both blocs.
Promoting Fair Investment Practices:
Unlike China’s debt-driven infrastructure projects, India focuses on sustainable and transparent investment models that ensure local benefits.
: India’s development assistance to Africa through concessional credit lines and capacity-building programs, such as the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC), contrasts with China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
Institutionalizing Global Development Initiatives:
India is working towards creating its own robust mechanisms for international development cooperation while collaborating with established institutions.
: India’s push for the African Union’s inclusion in G20 and engagement in trilateral cooperation with France and the UAE for African development reflects its long-term vision of bridging the Global North-South divide.
Mains PYQ:
The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is viewed as a cardinal subset of China’s larger ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative. Give a brief description of CPEC and enumerate the reasons why India has distanced itself from the same.

protection to individuals against arbitrary arrest and preventive detention
It has two parts:
1. Article 22(1) & 22(2) – Protection in Ordinary Arrests:
The arrested person must be
informed of the grounds of arrest as soon as possible
The person has the
right to consult and be defended by a lawyer of their choice
They
must be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours
2. Article 22(3) to 22(7) – Preventive Detention Provisions:
Preventive detention
without trial cannot exceed 3 months
, unless approved by an
Advisory Board
The government may
deny disclosure of reasons if it affects public interest
Parliament can extend detention beyond 3 months
in special cases.
Key Highlights of Supreme Court’s Recent Judgment:
The Supreme Court ruled that
informing an arrested person of the grounds of arrest is a fundamental right
Non-compliance
violates both Articles 22(1) and 21 (Right to Liberty)
, rendering the arrest
invalid
Grounds of arrest must be
clearly conveyed
in an
effective manner
Providing the
grounds in writing
is the
best practice
(as suggested in
Pankaj Bansal vs Union of India
).
As per
Section 50A of CrPC
accused’s family or nominated person
must also be informed to allow
legal representation
Magistrates
must ensure compliance. If
Article 22(1) is not followed
, the arrest
is illegal, and the accused must be released
Violation of Article 22(1) is a
ground for Bail.
Even if statutory restrictions on bail exist,
courts can grant bail if fundamental rights are violated
If the accused claims non-compliance, the
Investigating Officer must prove that Article 22(1) was followed
Relevant Supreme Court Judgments:
Pankaj Bansal vs Union of India (2023):
SC advised that grounds of arrest should ideally be provided in writing.
Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India (1978):
“Procedure established by law” must be fair, just, and reasonable.
DK Basu vs State of West Bengal (1997):
Established guidelines to prevent custodial abuse and ensure due process.
Ram Manohar Lohia vs State of Bihar (1965):
Distinguished between law and order (individual impact) and public order (societal impact).
