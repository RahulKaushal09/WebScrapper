CSR’S CONTRIBUTIONS TO AGRI SUSTAINABILITY
Syllabus:
Mains – GS 2 & GS 3
Context:
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) figures has been increasing over the years. But its contributiona towards agriculture remains a concern.
Background: –
A decade ago, India became the first country to legally mandate Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Section 135 of the Companies Act 2013 outlines the rules and regulations governing CSR. According to the National CSR Portal, from 2014 to 2023, Rs 1.84 lakh crore of CSR funds were disbursed.
Key takeaways
Corporate entities in India have shown clear intent to support climate action and sustainability in the agricultural sector through their CSR budgets.
Capital requirements and infrastructural development are the most important needs of agriculture — and this is also where CSR activities have previously contributed and are expected to continue doing so. Some examples of such activities are establishing grain banks, farmer schools, livelihood projects based on agriculture and allied activities, water conservation projects, and energy-efficient irrigation.
The recent paradigm shift in agriculture towards sustainability and modern agriculture makes a good case for CSR funds from the private sector.
However, there is an important problem that hinders CSR’s potential in agriculture: there is currently no way to fully determine the extent of funding going into these projects consistently and distinctively, and to categorise them based on targeted sectors of CSR activities. In other words, current reporting mechanisms have little to no emphasis on agriculture-related CSR initiatives.
This isn’t the case with CSR sectors like healthcare and education, which are the funds’ largest recipients and make up half of the total CSR contributions. Importantly, their allocations can be tracked effectively because their activities are clearly demarcated and well-defined.
Under activities mentioned in Schedule VII of the Companies Act, activities targeting agricultural sustainability could fall under 11 of the 29 development sectors of CSR allocations specified in documents on the National CSR Portal. These are gender equality; agroforestry; poverty, eradicating hunger and malnutrition; technology incubators; animal welfare; environmental sustainability; livelihood enhancement projects; conservation of natural resources; rural development projects; socio-economic inequalities; and women’s empowerment.
But there’s little chance of tracking the funds spent for agriculture-related initiatives alone because these 11 sectors encompass a great variety of activities, many of which are unrelated to agricultural sustainability, thus affecting reporting and limiting sectoral impact assessments.
To encourage sustainable activities in land-based sectors in India, including agriculture, forestry, and fishing, this is of particular concern because these sectors are related to various aspects of human wellbeing and to policy priorities in India, including rural development and climate action.
Given this issue as well as the importance of agriculture for the Indian economy, specifying agriculture as a distinct sector in CSR activities is crucial.
Transitioning the reporting framework based on sectors receiving funds would also help streamline and better target the available funds, will add more meaning to the contributions, and will ensure transparency.

SANCTION NEEDED UNDER PMLA TO PROSECUTE PUBLIC SERVANTS
Prelims & Mains – POLITY
: The Supreme Court recently held that Section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) that mandates prior sanction from the government to take cognizance of an offence against public servants will apply to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) too.
Supreme Court said this while upholding the Telangana High Court decision, setting aside a trial court order taking cognizance of the complaint against IAS officers facing money laundering charges.
Section 197 (1) says, “When any person who is or was a judge or magistrate or a public servant not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the government, is accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, no court shall take cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction”.
ED had 2 arguments in court. First one of the accused cannot be considered public servant. Secondly, ED contended that in view of Section 71 of the PMLA, its provisions have an overriding effect over the provisions of the other statutes, including the CrPC.
The court did not agree with ED saying that first condition as required under Section 197(1), is satisfied in the case of both the respondents as they are civil servants. Also, the acts alleged against them are related to the discharge of the duties entrusted to them and thus the second condition for the applicability of Section 197(1) also stands satisfied.
The ruling pointed out that Section 65 of PMLA makes the provisions of the CrPC applicable to all proceedings under the PMLA, provided the same are not inconsistent with the PMLA provisions.
Additional Information
The PMLA lays down stringent standard for granting bail. Section 45 of the PMLA is a ‘negative’ provision — which bars courts from granting bail unless the accused can prove that there is no “prima facie” case against them, and that they will not commit any offence in the future.
The first challenge to PMLA was against the alternate criminal law system that the PMLA creates since the ED is kept outside the purview of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The ED is not considered ‘police’, and hence does not follow the provisions of CrPC for searches, seizures, arrests, and attachment of properties.

KUMBH MELA
Prelims & Mains – CURRENT EVENT
The Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 is going to be held at Prayagraj from January 13th, 2025 to February 26th, 2025.
The Maha Kumbh Mela is deeply embedded in Hindu mythology and represents one of the most significant gatherings of faith in the world.
Kumbh Mela is a major pilgrimage and festival in Hinduism, celebrated four times over the course of 12 years, the site of the observance rotating between four river-bank pilgrimage sites: Prayagraj (Ganges-Yamuna-Sarasvati confluence), Haridwar (Ganges), Nashik (Godavari), and Ujjain (Shipra).
The timing of each Kumbh Mela is determined by the astrological positions of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter. The celebrations occur at the exact moment when these positions are fully occupied, as it is considered to be the holiest time in Hinduism.
The festival is marked by a ritual dip in the waters. The act of immersing in these holy waters is believed to purify one of sins, liberate both individuals and their ancestors from the cycle of rebirth, and ultimately guide them towards Moksha, or spiritual liberation.
Kumbh Mela was recognized by UNESCO in 2017 as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity.

TITANIUM
Prelims – SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL), a central PSU, and Ust-Kamenogorsk Titanium and Magnesium Plant JSC (UKTMP JSC), Kazakhstan signed an agreement to establish an Indo-Kazakh joint venture company — for production of titanium slag in India utilising ilmenite from Odisha.
The company will function as a catalyst in developing titanium value chain within India as it shall benefit low-grade ilmenite into high-grade titanium feedstock while generating employment.
India possesses approximately 11% of the world’s titanium-iron ore deposits, primarily found in the beach sands along the coasts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha.
Titanium is a strong, low-density, highly corrosion-resistant, and lustrous metallic element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22.
Strength: Titanium is as strong as steel but significantly lighter (about 45% lighter), making it ideal for applications where strength-to-weight ratio is crucial.
Corrosion Resistance: It has excellent corrosion resistance, especially against seawater, acids, and chlorine, due to a protective oxide film that forms naturally on its surface.
Melting Point: High melting point of about 1,668°C (3,034°F), which makes it useful in high-temperature applications.
Chemical Properties:
Oxidation: Titanium can easily form titanium dioxide (TiO₂), a stable oxide layer that provides its corrosion-resistant properties.
Alloying: It is commonly alloyed with other metals like aluminum, iron, vanadium, and molybdenum to enhance its mechanical properties.
Biocompatibility: Titanium is biocompatible and non-toxic, which makes it ideal for medical applications like implants, prosthetics, and surgical instruments.
Major Uses of Titanium
Aerospace Industry: Titanium’s strength, light weight, and heat resistance make it an ideal material for aerospace components, including jet engines, aircraft frames, and missile structures. Titanium alloys help reduce weight and increase fuel efficiency in aircraft.
Medical and Dental Applications: Due to its biocompatibility, titanium is widely used in orthopedic implants, dental implants, and bone plates. It is also used in surgical instruments and tools because it does not react adversely with body tissues.
Automobile and Sports Equipment: High-performance car manufacturers use titanium in engines and exhaust systems for its strength and heat resistance. Titanium is also popular in sports equipment, like golf clubs, bicycles, and tennis rackets, for its light weight and durability.
Pigments and Cosmetics: Titanium dioxide (TiO₂) is widely used as a white pigment in paints, coatings, plastics, and cosmetics due to its opacity and brightness. It is also used in sunscreens for its UV-blocking properties.
Titanium Extraction and Production
Ores: The main sources of titanium are ilmenite (FeTiO₃) and rutile (TiO₂). Australia, South Africa, Canada, and India are major producers.
Extraction: The Kroll process is commonly used to extract titanium from its ores.
Recycling: Titanium can be recycled efficiently, which is beneficial for industries like aerospace where material costs are high.

**********SC’s Interpretation of Private Property Curtails State’s Power but Enhances Judicial Review
Context
The recent Supreme Court judgment in Property Owners Association v State of Maharashtra (2024) represents a critical legal debate
, balancing property rights with the state's power of eminent domain.
This issue has long been
a cornerstone of India's constitutional landscape
, sparking a decades-long
struggle between the judiciary and the legislature
judgement makes it imperative to explore the central themes and implications of the Property Owners Association case, the complex interpretation of material resources of the community
, and the nuanced positions held by the majority and minority in this ruling.
The Background of the Case and Judicial Interventions
Conflict over Property Rights
clash between property rights and state authority
over property was
among the most defining issues
in the early years of the Indian republic.
With each attempt by Parliament to curtail property rights,
the judiciary countered by safeguarding these rights under the Constitution.
Notably,
Article 31-C
(introduced in 1971)
states that if a law was intended to further the Directive Principles contained in Article 39 (b) and (c) of the Constitution, it could not be held to violate the
Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.
Specifically,
Article 39(b) encourages the state to design policies that ensure “that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community
are so distributed as best
to subserve the common good.”
Scrutiny of the Term ‘Material Resources of the Community’ by the 9-Judge Bench
The immediate
question involved a 1986 amendment to the Maharashtra Housing and Development (MHADA) Act, allowing the state to take over dilapidated buildings from private owners
and hand them to tenants.
legal issue was whether ‘material resources of the community’ included private property.
interpretation would decide whether property owners could claim protection under Articles 14 and 19
or if state action in line with Article 39(b) would render their constitutional rights secondary.
Past judgments had suggested a broad interpretation
, implying all private property could be deemed material resources.
However,
these decisions faced growing scepticism, prompting the need for a nine-judge bench to clarify
the matter definitively.
A Detailed Analysis of the Property Owners Association Judgement
Majority Opinion: A Context-Dependent Interpretation
A Nuanced Approach
In the majority judgment,
Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and six other judges introduced a more nuanced approach
declaring that while ‘material resources of the community’ could encompass private property
, this inclusion would be context-dependent.
ruling suggests that not all private property necessarily qualifies as a community resource.
Court provided several factors for consideration, including the nature of the resource,
its scarcity, and its impact on the community’s well-being.
case-by-case method avoids a blanket interpretation that all private property constitutes material resources
, opening the door for greater judicial oversight over legislative attempts to redistribute private property.
A Departure from Past Judicial Thinking: Evolving Understanding of Property Rights
contextual reading marks a departure from earlier judicial thinking
which leaned heavily toward socialist values,
interpreting Article 39(b) as a basis for comprehensive property redistribution.
majority view indicates a shift in line with contemporary policy preferences
, moving away from nationalization and redistribution toward welfare-oriented governance.
interpretation is significant as it highlights the evolving understanding of property rights within India’s constitutional framework
, where safeguarding fundamental rights is balanced against the state’s policy goals.
Minority Opinion: A Defence of Parliamentary Sovereignty
Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia’s dissenting opinion offers a contrasting view, advocating for a more inclusive interpretation
that would see all private property as part of the ‘material resources of the community.’
According to Justice Dhulia,
this expansive understanding aligns with the Constitution’s intention to promote equitable wealth distribution.
He
emphasises that decisions about what resources qualify as community assets should rest with Parliament, not the judiciary.
Justice Dhulia’s view underscores the belief that an elected legislature, which reflects public sentiment, is best positioned to make decisions
about economic distribution, thereby preserving parliamentary sovereignty over resource allocation.
Justice B Nagarathna agrees with the majority opinion but adds the nuance
that the personal effects of an individual cannot become material resources.
Implications of the Judgement on the Scope of Judicial Review
Reassertion of Judicial Review and the Scope of Article 31-C
Article 31-C attempted to limit judicial scrutiny of laws advancing Directive Principles,
effectively placing certain legislative actions beyond judicial reach.
this case reasserts the judiciary’s role by establishing that courts must interpret Article 39(b) in each specific context
before determining whether a law falls outside their review.
In essence,
while Article 31-C sought to insulate certain laws from judicial review, this decision reclaims some judicial oversight
, ensuring that
fundamental rights are not entirely bypassed by invoking Directive Principles.
A Shift in Constitutional Interpretation
renewed judicial role reflects a significant shift in constitutional interpretation, challenging the intent of Article 31-C
by expanding judicial authority in determining when redistribution laws may infringe upon fundamental rights.
Court’s reinterpretation of Article 31-C reaffirms that no legislation should automatically evade scrutiny
merely due to its association with Directive Principles.
Instead,
the judiciary remains a vital arbiter in determining the balance between state interests and individual rights.
Some Other Key Aspects of Property Owners Association Judgement
Practical and Cultural Implications
journey of the Property Owners Association case, with its prolonged legal proceedings, mirrors Saeed Akhtar Mirza’s film Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho
, where a tenant battles a dilapidated building’s neglectful owner.
1986 MHADA amendment appeared as a legislative response to such predicaments
, permitting state intervention to protect tenants.
Ironically,
the case has since shifted from tenants’ rights to a protracted wait for a final resolution,
highlighting
how judicial delays can impact both property owners and tenants alike.
Supreme Court’s ruling serves as a reminder of the complexity of resource redistribution laws
prolonged nature of property disputes in India’s judicial system.
Guidelines for Future Debates on Property Rights
Ultimately,
this decision reaffirms the Supreme Court’s role in mediating between fundamental rights and state interests
, marking a cautious advance toward judicial review’s preservation.
Although
it provides a refined interpretation of Article 39(b), the judgment only sets guiding principles, leaving future cases to determine its practical application.
As India’s legal landscape continues to evolve,
this ruling will influence ongoing debates about the balance between individual rights and collective welfare
, and the extent to which courts may challenge legislative authority in a democratic state.
Conclusion
The Property Owners Association judgment underscores the complexities surrounding property rights, state authority
, and judicial review within India’s constitutional framework.
By
interpreting ‘material resources of the community’ as context-dependent, the majority judgment reflects a balanced view
that incorporates both constitutional ideals and contemporary policy priorities.
While the majority affirms a case-by-case approach
that aligns with changing economic paradigms,
the dissent argues for parliamentary sovereignty in determining resource allocation, advocating a more consistent, inclusionary interpretation of community resources.

**********What are Airships?
Recently, a few companies have attempted to control the buoyancy of airships — a longstanding challenge that has prevented their use for cargo transportation.
About
Airships:
Airships are
lighter-than-air
vertical-lift vehicles
that achieve flight by using buoyant gasses that are less dense than surrounding air.
There are three main types of airships:
non-rigid (or blimps), semi-rigid and rigid.
Typically, these bullet-shaped craft are filled with
helium or hydrogen
, and composed of three main parts: a balloon-like hull, a gondola and a propulsion system.
Airships were the first aircraft capable of controlled powered flight and were thought to be the future of travel for some years in the early 20th century.
How airships work?
lighter-than-air aircraft
that are lifted by gas with a density lower than atmospheric gases. This principle also operates in helium balloons.
Early airships used hydrogen as the lifting gas since it was cheap, easy to produce, and the lightest existing gas. But hydrogen was also extremely flammable.
Most modern
airships use helium
, which is non-combustible.
Uses:
They see limited use today as advertising platforms, for aerial observation by scientists and militaries, and in the tourism industry.
Advantages:
Airships are significantly
less polluting than aeroplanes
as they do not burn fossil fuels to achieve lift. They can also reach more places than ships or trucks.

**********Bran
A recent study highlights that keeping bran on millet improves the health benefits and should be promoted in Indian diets to improve diet quality.
About
Bran:
It is the
edible broken seed coat
, or protective outer layer, of wheat, rye, or other cereal grains, separated from the kernel.
In flour processing, the coarse chaff, or bran, is removed from the ground kernels by sifting or bolting in a rotating, meshed, cylindrical frame.
It provides dietary fiber and many different bioactive substances, including phenolic compounds, which can exert a beneficial effect on human health.
Removing the bran from millets results in
decreasing the protein, dietary fibre
fat, mineral and phytate content
in them while increasing the carbohydrates and amylose content.
Dehusked millets are nutritious and should be promoted in Indian diets to improve diet quality, debranned millets are nutritionally inferior and can increase the glycemic load of Indian diets.
What are Millets?
Millets are a highly varied
group of small-seeded grasses
, widely grown around the world as cereal crops or grains for fodder and human food.
This crop is favoured due to its
productivity and short growing season
under dry, high-temperature conditions (hardy and drought-resistant crops).
powerhouse of nutrients
, which score over rice and wheat in terms of minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibre content, as well as amino acid profile.
Though rich in both iron and zinc, wheat’s protein content comprises glutens, known to trigger gastrointestinal and autoimmune disorders in many people.
Millets are high in minerals such as
calcium, iron, phosphorus, and potassium
, and they are an excellent source of phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds when compared to other major cereals (rice, wheat, maize).
Millets provide a range of health benefits such as antiaging
, anticarcinogenic, anti-atherosclerogenic, antibacterial
and antioxidant effects.

**********Agrivoltaic Farming
The Seventh Session of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) culminated in New Delhi. During the site visit, the practical implementation of agrivoltaic systems was showcased to the delegates of various countries.
About
Agrivoltaic Farming:
It is the practice of
growing crops underneath solar panels.
The panels are positioned 2-3 metres off the ground and sit at an angle of 30 degrees, providing shade and offering crops protection from the weather.
This farming primarily focuses on the simultaneous use of land for both agriculture and solar energy generation.
It’s also sometimes referred to as
Agri solar, dual-use solar, or low-impact solar
Solar panels have to sometimes be elevated or suspended to allow plants to grow beneath them.
Another option is putting them on the roofs of greenhouses. This allows enough light and rainwater to reach the crops, as well as providing access to farm machinery.
It uses poles or frames to mount solar panels on the ground, leaving space for crops to grow under or around them. Some solar panels can also rotate or form a canopy to adjust the amount of sunlight and shade on the crops.
Advantages
increases land-use efficiency
, as it lets solar farms and agriculture share ground, rather than making them compete against one another.
And certain crops appear to thrive when grown in such environments, according to a number of recent studies.
The shade from the panels protects vegetables from heat stress and water loss.

**********Are CSR Contributions to Agriculture Properly Tracked?
What’s in Today’s Article?
About CSR (Origin, Meaning, CSR in India, Companies Covered Under the Act, etc.)
News Summary
Origin of CSR:
Howard Bowen, an American economist, is widely regarded as the father of modern CSR.
In his book “Social Responsibilities of the Businessman” in 1953, he writes, “
CSR refers to the obligations of businessmen to pursue those policies which are desirable in terms of the objectives and values of our society
”.
This has become the backbone by which modern CSR principles are based.
Meaning of CSR:
The concept of CSR rests on the ideology of businesses giving back to society as they grow and benefit.
Companies take resources in the form of raw materials, human resources etc from the society.
By performing the task of CSR activities, the companies are giving something back to the society.
Examples of common CSR objectives include minimizing environmental externalities, promoting volunteerism among company employees, and donating to charity.
CSR in India:
CSR in India has traditionally been seen as a philanthropic activity.
However, with the introduction of
Section 135 in the Companies Act 2013
, India became the first country to have statutorily mandated CSR for specified companies.
The mandatory CSR provisions were made effective from 1
April, 2014 for companies with a certain profit, turn-over or valuation.

The companies which fall in the ambit of any of the following three criteria are required to spend on CSR.
Company with a net worth of Rs. 500 crore or more, or
Turnover of Rs. 1,000 crore or more, or
Net profit of Rs. 5 crore or more during the immediately preceding financial year.
Such companies are required to do CSR spend amounting to 2 % of their average annual profit over last three years.
The Act also enumerates the activities that can be undertaken and the manner in which the companies can undertake CSR projects/programmes.
Performance So Far:
CSR Expenditure Trends:
Cumulative Spending
: From 2014 to 2023, companies in India have collectively spent approximately ‚ ₹1.84 lakh crore on CSR activities.
Annual Spending
: In the fiscal year 2022-23, the prescribed CSR budget for 301 large companies was ‚ ₹13,426 crore, with an actual expenditure of ‚ ₹12,890 crore, indicating a compliance rate of over 96%.
Sectoral Allocation:
Healthcare and WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene):
26% of companies identified this as their primary CSR focus.
Environment and Sustainability:
23% of companies prioritized this area, reflecting a growing commitment to environmental issues.
Promotion of Education:
23% of companies dedicated resources to educational initiatives.
News Summary:
In India, agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy, providing employment to nearly 47% of the population and contributing around 16.73% to the GDP.
Recognizing this, India legally mandated Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in 2013 under Section 135 of the Companies Act, requiring certain corporations to allocate part of their profits towards social causes.
Since then, CSR contributions have increased significantly, with ₹1.84 lakh crore disbursed from 2014 to 2023.
This raises questions about CSR’s role in agriculture, especially regarding the impact of contributions on agricultural sustainability.
CSR’s Role in Agriculture:
With a high percentage of India's workforce employed in agriculture, CSR initiatives have the potential to address key issues in the sector:
Environmental Degradation
: As natural resources become strained, the need for sustainable agricultural practices grows.
Stagnant Farmer Incomes
: With limited growth in earnings, initiatives can help improve productivity and livelihood.
Climate Change Threats
: Shifts in climate patterns challenge crop yields and agricultural stability, requiring adaptive practices.
A CSR outlook report highlighted that 23% of surveyed companies prioritize "environment and sustainability," indicating an interest in supporting agricultural and environmental projects.
CSR funds have been allocated to activities like grain banks, farmer schools, agricultural livelihood projects, water conservation, and energy-efficient irrigation.
The recent focus on sustainability in agriculture aligns with CSR goals and encourages private sector engagement.
Importance of Sector-Specific Reporting:
Designating agriculture as a standalone CSR category could improve the clarity and effectiveness of contributions. This would enable:
Targeted Funding
: Funds could be directed toward specific needs in agriculture, such as sustainable farming methods or climate resilience measures.
Transparency and Accountability
: More precise reporting on CSR contributions would ensure companies are held accountable for their impact on agricultural sustainability.
Enhanced Impact Measurement
: Identifying the unique needs within agricultural ecosystems allows for targeted interventions, which could result in more measurable and meaningful changes in the sector.

**********Supreme Court to Decide on Aligarh Muslim University’s Minority Status
Why in News?
A Bench headed by the CJI will deliver its verdict (on CJI’s last working day in office) on whether Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) can claim minority status under Article 30 of the Indian Constitution.
What’s in Today’s Article?
Background of the Controversy around AMU’s Minority Status
What Minority Status Entails for AMU?
Arguments from the Centre and AMU
Conclusion
Article 30 of the Indian Constitution:
It consists of provisions that safeguard various rights of the minority community in the country
keeping in mind the principle of equality as well
Article 30(1)
says that all minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.
Article 30(1A)
deals with the fixation of the amount for acquisition of property of any educational institution established by minority groups.
Article 30(2)
states that the government should not discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, while giving aid.
Background of the Controversy around AMU’s Minority Status:
It originated in 1967
when the Supreme Court (SC) ruled on challenges to amendments to the university’s founding Act, arguing that they stripped the Muslim community of the right to administer the institution.
In 1951
, non-Muslims were allowed to join the University Court (the supreme governing body at the time), and the Visitor - a role held by the President of India, replaced the university’s Lord Rector.
In 1965
, the Executive Council’s powers were expanded, diminishing the University Court’s authority.
The SC concluded
that AMU was not established by the Muslim minority but by an Act of Parliament (Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920).
This judgement, known as the
S. Azeez Basha vs. Union of India case
, held that AMU lacked minority institution status.
In 1981
, the government amended the AMU Act to assert that the institution was created by the Muslim community to advance their cultural and educational goals.
However,
the Allahabad HC
struck down both this amendment and AMU’s 50% Muslim reservation in 2006, reaffirming the Azeez Basha ruling.
The issue was then referred to a larger bench
and decision follows years of legal debates and a seven-judge bench led by CJI reserving its judgement in February
The upcoming judgement will determine if Azeez Basha ruling will be overturned.
Article 15(5) of the Constitution
exempts minority educational institutions from reserving seats for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).
Since AMU’s minority status is sub judice, and the SC directed in 2006 that status quo be maintained,
the university does not have SC/ST quotas
If the SC declares AMU a minority institution:
AMU would not have to reserve seats for SC/ST/OBC/EWS groups but could
reserve seats for Muslims, potentially up to 50% or more
The university’s administrative structure would shift
from its current setup, which includes a diverse Executive Council, and it
would have a separate admissions process.
Arguments from the Centre and AMU:
The St. Stephen’s college precedent:
The SC had previously recognised the minority status of Delhi’s St. Stephen’s College in
1992
, affirming its right to admit Christian students up to 50% and administer itself autonomously.
The centre’s argument:
The Centre distinguished St. Stephen’s from AMU
, noting that the former was founded privately, while AMU was created by an Act of Parliament and continuously receives government funding.
The Centre argued
that AMU, as a national institution,
should uphold its secular foundations
and not prioritise one community’s interests.
Counter arguments:
contended that exempting it from certain quotas does not harm public interest, as
Article 30 provides minorities with special rights
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal argued
That
minority rights
contribute to societal equality
by balancing the needs of diverse social sections.
That (according to the St. Stephen’s ruling) minority communities have a “
continuing right to administer
” institutions they establish, irrespective of government involvement.
Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan pointed to
institutions like Aliah University in Kolkata
, which retain minority status despite government funding.
Conclusion:
The SC’s upcoming decision will be pivotal for AMU
, determining whether it can claim minority status and retain autonomy over its admissions and governance under Article 30.
This verdict will also impact minority educational institutions’ rights and their relationship with state policies on social justice and equality.

**********India's CPI and IIP data release time to change
Why in news?
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has changed the release time of retail inflation (CPI) and factory output (IIP) data from 5:30 pm to 4 pm on the 12th of each month. This adjustment aims to give more time for data analysis on the release day and aligns with the closing hours of India’s major financial markets.
What’ in today’s article?
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
Index of Industrial Production (IIP)
Significance of CPI and IIP data
Change in the timings for release of CPI inflation and IIP data
CPI is a metric that measures retail inflation by collecting data on the prices of goods and services that are consumed by the retail population of the country.
National Statistical Office (NSO)
, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation releases CPI.
CPI is released for all-India and States/UTs separately for rural, urban and combined (national).
Currently, CPI is calculated using
2012 as a base year
Items for the CPI basket of goods and services classified across categories.
Few of the categories are; food and beverages, clothing, housing, fuel and light, recreation and etc.
All categories are assigned weights (as shown in the diagram).
Currently, CPI is calculated by taking into consideration 299 items.
About
The IIP number measures the industrial production for the period under review, usually a month, as against the reference period.
There is a lag of six weeks in the publication of the IIP index data after the reference month ends.
It is currently calculated using 2011-2012 as the base year.
Institution involved
NSO under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) releases the IIP data.
IIP Index Components
IIP is a composite indicator that measures the growth rate of industry groups classified under:
Broad sectors
, namely, Mining (14.4%), Manufacturing (77.6%) and Electricity (8%)
Use-based sectors
, namely Basic Goods, Capital Goods and Intermediate Goods etc.
These Eight Core Industries mentioned in above section
comprise 40.27 percent of the weight of items
included in the IIP.
Consumer Price Index (CPI): Key Inflation Indicator
CPI tracks changes in the prices of goods and services purchased by households, serving as a key macroeconomic indicator of inflation.
It is widely used by governments and central banks for inflation targeting, monitoring price stability, and as deflators in national accounts.
Inflation, measured as the year-on-year change in CPI, indicates the rate of price increase for a specific basket of goods.
Currently, the CPI (combined) uses the base year 2012, updated from the base year 2010 in January 2015.
Index of Industrial Production (IIP): Measure of Industrial Activity
IIP gauges the level of industrial production in an economy, reflecting short-term changes in the output volume of selected industrial products relative to a base period (currently 2011-12).
The IIP assesses industrial growth across three sectors: Mining, Manufacturing, and Electricity, along with use-based categories like basic goods, capital goods, intermediate goods, consumer durables, and non-durables.
It is monitored as a short-term indicator of industrial activity until the Annual Survey of Industries and National Accounts Statistics are released.
About the news
India's Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation is changing the release time for key economic data.
The Consumer Price Index and Index of Industrial Production will now be released at 4 pm on the 12th of each month.
This new time aligns with the closing of major financial markets in India. The ministry aims to enhance transparency and accessibility with this change.
The CPI and IIP indicators are essential for economic policy and market decisions.
If the
12th falls on a holiday, CPI data will be released the following working day, while IIP data will be released the prior working day
Why was the data release timing kept at 5:30 pm earlier?
In 2013, reports of data leaks led the Ministry to shift the release time of retail inflation and IIP data to 5:30 pm from July that year, to avoid influencing trading during market hours.
Prior to this, the data was released around 11-11:30 am, which significantly impacted forex and bond markets.
The change aligned with market closures, as forex and bond markets close at 5 pm.
While retail inflation data has always been released on a monthly basis, the wholesale inflation data was released weekly till December 2012.
Now, it’s released on the 14th of every month around noon.
Concerns About New Timing’s Market Sensitivity
While the new timing coincides with stock market closing, analysts note that government bond and foreign exchange markets remain open until 5 pm, meaning the data could still impact active trading in these markets.
The Ministry emphasizes that the timing aligns with MoSPI’s commitment to transparency and accessibility.

**********Are CSR contributions to agriculture properly tracked?
Economics
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Sustainable Agriculture; Significance of CSR;
Why in the News?
Ten years ago, India became the first country to legally mandate
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
. The
section 135
of the
Companies Act 2013
establishes the rules governing CSR.
According to the National CSR Portal, ₹1.84 lakh crore in CSR funds was disbursed between 2014 and 2023.
About CSR:
is a business practice where companies contribute to social, economic, and environmental betterment, addressing societal needs alongside their profit-making objectives.
In India, the minimum percentage of a
company’s net profit
that must be spent on corporate
social responsibility (CSR) is 2%.
Sectoral division of CSR:
Education:
Receives the highest CSR share (33%-40%) for building schools, scholarships, infrastructure, and vocational training.
Health Care:
Allocates 20%-30% of CSR funds to hospitals, health camps, sanitation, and disease prevention.
Environmental Sustainability:
Accounts for 5%-10% of CSR funds, with projects in biodiversity conservation, waste management, and renewable energy.
CSR’s Role in Agriculture
Claims 10%-15% of CSR funds, targeting infrastructure, agricultural practices, and livelihood support.
Since the enactment of the Companies Act in 2013, which mandates CSR spending, a total of Rs
has been disbursed in CSR funds
from 2014 to 2023.
These funds have increasingly
targeted sustainability initiatives
within agriculture, with 23% of surveyed companies prioritizing “environment and sustainability” in their CSR activities.
Over
90.8% of farmers
involved in CSR programs reported improvements in income or risk reduction due to these initiatives.
How much of an impact does Agriculture have on India’s GDP?
Agriculture contributes approximately 15% to 18.2% of India’s GDP, reflecting a decline from 35% in 1990-91 due to rapid growth in the
industrial and
service sectors
. The average annual growth rate of the agricultural sector has been around 4% over the
last five years
(acc to pib data)
Agriculture remains crucial for employment, providing livelihoods for about 42% of the population, which is significantly higher than the global average of 25%.
What are the key requirements to improve agricultural sustainability?
Investment in Infrastructure:
There is a pressing need for capital investment in infrastructure development, including irrigation systems, cold storage, and transportation networks to reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access.
Technological Advancements:
Adoption of modern agricultural practices and technologies is essential. This includes better seed varieties, efficient irrigation methods, and sustainable farming techniques to enhance productivity.
Environmental Sustainability Initiatives:
Projects focusing on water conservation, energy-efficient irrigation, and agroforestry are critical for maintaining ecological balance while improving agricultural output.
What hinders CSR’s potential for agriculture?
Lack of Clear Reporting Mechanisms:
One of the main obstacles is the absence of robust frameworks to track and categorize CSR funding specifically directed towards agricultural initiatives. Current reporting practices do not emphasize agriculture-related CSR activities adequately.
Diverse Allocation Categories:
CSR activities can fall under multiple categories (e.g., gender equality, and environmental sustainability), making it difficult to isolate funds specifically aimed at agricultural sustainability. This lack of specificity hampers effective monitoring and impact assessment.
Need for Distinct Sector Identification:
To maximize CSR contributions to agriculture, it is crucial to identify agriculture as a distinct sector within CSR activities. This would streamline funding processes and enhance transparency and accountability in how funds are utilized for agricultural development.
Way forward:
Establish Agriculture as a Separate CSR Category
: Need to create a distinct sector for agriculture in CSR reporting to streamline funding, improve transparency, and enable targeted monitoring of agriculture-focused initiatives.
Implement Comprehensive Reporting Frameworks
: The government should develop robust mechanisms for tracking CSR funds specifically allocated to agricultural projects, ensuring clear categorization and facilitating better impact assessments.
Mains PYQ:
With a consideration towards the strategy of inclusive growth, the new Companies Bill, 2013 has indirectly made CSR a mandatory obligation. Discuss the challenges expected in its implementation in right earnest. Also discuss other provisions in the Bill and their implications.

**********India should be part of RCEP, CPTPP: NITI Aayog CEO
International Relations
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Regional Groupings; Trade Relations; Significance and issues related to RCEP;
Why in the News?
According to
, India should join the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)
and the
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP
).
What are the implications of India joining RCEP and CPTPP?
Enhanced Trade Opportunities:
Joining RCEP and CPTPP could significantly boost India’s trade by providing access to larger markets, particularly in Asia-Pacific regions.
These agreements encompass a wide range of goods and services, potentially increasing India’s exports, especially from its
Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs),
which account for
40% of exports.
Integration into Global Supply Chains:
Participation in these trade blocs would facilitate India’s integration into global supply chains, allowing it to benefit from the ‘China plus one’ strategy that many countries are adopting to diversify their supply sources away from China.
This could enhance India’s manufacturing sector and attract foreign investment.
Regulatory Alignment:
Being part of these agreements would necessitate aligning India’s regulatory frameworks with international standards, which could improve the business environment and attract more foreign direct investment (FDI).
How does India’s current tariff structure affect its competitiveness in global trade?
India’s current tariff structure is characterized by relatively high average tariffs compared to other major economies. For instance:
Average Tariffs:
India has an average applied tariff of
approximately 13.8%
, which is higher than that of
China (9.8%)
U.S. (3.4%)
but lower than some other countries when considering trade-weighted averages.
High Bound Tariffs:
Many of India’s bound tariff rates on agricultural products are among the highest globally, ranging from
100% to 300%,
creating significant barriers for foreign exporters.
What are the risks associated with joining RCEP, particularly concerning competition with China?
Increased Competition with China:
One of the primary risks of joining RCEP is the potential for increased competition with Chinese firms, which may have cost advantages due to economies of scale and established supply chains.
Pressure on Domestic Industries:
Opening up to international competition might pressure local industries, particularly in sectors where they are less competitive compared to their counterparts in member countries.
This could lead to
job losses
and require significant adjustments within certain sectors.
Easy geopolitical Impact on the economy:
Increased reliance on trade agreements may expose India to
external economic fluctuations,
particularly if global demand shifts or if geopolitical tensions impact trade dynamics within these blocs.
Way forward:
Selective Tariff Reductions and Safeguards for Sensitive Sectors:
India should negotiate phased tariff reductions and secure safeguards for vulnerable sectors like agriculture and small manufacturing.
This approach would protect local industries while allowing gradual integration into RCEP and CPTPP markets.
Strengthening Domestic Industries and MSMEs:
India can boost competitiveness by enhancing MSME support through targeted subsidies, infrastructure improvements, and technology upgrades. Strengthening these sectors will help India leverage new market access and build resilience against foreign competition.
Mains PYQ:
Evaluate the economic and strategic dimensions of India’s Look East Policy in the context of the post-Cold War international scenario.

**********How climate change is bringing back the idea of Airships?
Science Tech
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Prelims level:
Why in the News?
Some companies have been working to solve the
buoyancy challenge
of Airships, a longstanding issue that has hindered their use for
cargo transportation
.
What are Airships?
Airships are
lighter-than-air aircraft
capable of
controlled powered flight
They were the
first aircraft
to achieve this and were considered the
future of travel
in the early 20th century.
However, as
aeroplane technology
advanced, the popularity of airships declined due to their
technological limitations
Today, airships are used mainly for:
Advertising platforms
Aerial observation for research and military purposes
Tourism and scenic flights
Note:
Buoyancy is the force that makes things float. It acts in the opposite direction to gravity. When an object is placed in a fluid (like air or water), the fluid pushes up against the object, helping it to stay afloat.
How do Airships work?
Airships achieve lift by using
lighter-than-air gases
within their structure, much like
helium balloons
Early airships used
hydrogen
due to its
lightweight
low cost
However, hydrogen is
highly flammable
, leading to tragic incidents such as the
Hindenburg disaster
of 1937, which damaged public trust in airships.
Most airships today use
, a non-flammable gas that is safer than hydrogen.
helium is scarce
and expensive, costing about
$35 per cubic meter
(enough to lift just 1 kg).
Challenge with varying Buoyancy
Airships require the ability to
vary their buoyancy
to adjust for
weight changes
when picking up or dropping off loads.
Solutions such as
releasing and refilling helium
are impractical due to helium’s high cost and scarcity.
How Airships are a Promising Solution?
Airships hold potential as
low-emission cargo vehicles
due to their unique design:
Airships have a high
lift-to-drag ratio
, meaning they consume far less fuel than aeroplanes for moving the same load.
Companies are exploring the use of
ballast
to regulate airship buoyancy, a method common in
hot air balloons
submarines
A French company has created a
200-meter “flying crane”
airship called
LCA60T
, which can pick up water as ballast mid-flight, avoiding the need for specialized ground infrastructure.
With concerns about
and the
aviation industry’s carbon footprint
, airships offer a less polluting alternative. They do not burn fossil fuels to lift, making them an eco-friendly choice.
