Bihar’s Demand for Special Category Status
Source: TH
Why in News?
Recently, the Bihar
Chief Minister
reiterated the State’s long-standing demand to be granted
special category status
by the Centre, a move that would increase the amount of
tax revenues
that the State gets from the Centre.
Why is Bihar Demanding Special Category Status (SCS)?
Historical and Structural Challenges:
Bihar faces significant
economic challenges
, including a lack of
industrial development
and limited
investment opportunities.
The bifurcation of the state resulted in the
shifting of industries
to Jharkhand, exacerbating the employment and economic growth issues in Bihar.
Natural Calamities:
The state grapples with
natural calamities
like floods in the northern region and severe droughts in the southern part.
These recurring disasters
disrupt
agricultural activities
, especially in terms of
irrigation facilities
and the water supply remains inadequate affecting livelihoods and economic stability.
Lack of Infrastructure:
Bihar's inadequate infrastructure hampers its overall development, characterised by
poor road networks, limited healthcare access, and challenges in educational facilities.
In 2013, the
Raghuram Rajan Committee
set up by the Centre, placed Bihar in the
“least developed category”.
Poverty and Social Development:
Bihar has a
high poverty rate
, with a significant number of families living below the poverty line.
A recent survey by NITI Aayog reveals that Bihar is the state with the highest number of poor with
26.59% multidimensionally poor
in 2022-23 which is much higher than the national average of
11.28%.
Per-capita GDP of Bihar is Rs. 60,000 compared to Rs. 1,69,496 as the National average for 2022-23.
The state also lags in various
human development indicators
as well.
Funding for Development:
Seeking SCS is also a means to secure
substantial financial assistance
from the central government to address long-standing socio-economic challenges.
The Bihar government last year estimated that the granting of the special category status will help the State receive a
n additional 2.5 lakh crore rupees
over five years to spend on the
welfare of 94 lakh crore poor families.
What are the Arguments Against Bihar Getting the SCS?
However, some critics argue that increased funds might
incentivise poor policies
and penalise well-performing states, as the funds will be diverted to poorer states.
Historically
rule of law
in Bihar has been a major barrier to growth and investment.
The Centre already
devolves 42% of taxes from earlier 32% to states
as per the 14
Finance Commission. Any
additional strain on the Centre's funds
will potentially impact other national schemes and welfare measures.
Bihar is one of the fastest-growing states in India
. In 2022-23, Bihar’s GDP grew by 10.6%, higher than the national average of 7.2%.
Per capita income in real terms grew by 9.4% in the previous year.
More funds might offer
short-term relief
, but long-term growth depends on
improving
governance
and investment climate.
Although Bihar meets most of the criteria for the grant of SCS, it does not fulfil the
requirement of hilly terrain
geographically difficult areas
, which is considered to be the primary reason for difficulty in infrastructural development.
Central government
citing the
FC report
which made a recommendation to the Centre that
no State be accorded the SCS,
repeatedly denied the demands.
What is a Special Category Status?
About:
SCS is a classification given by the Centre
to assist the development of states that face geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.
Constitution
not make a provision
for SCS and this classification was later done on the recommendations of the
in 1969.
Status was first accorded to
Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and Nagaland
Telangana
is the newest State of India to be accorded the status.
SCS is different from Special status
which imparts enhanced legislative and political rights, while SCS deals with
only economic
and financial aspects.
For instance, J&K used to have Special status before
Article 370
was repealed.
Parameters (Based on
Gadgil Formula
):
Hilly Terrain
Low Population Density and/or Sizeable
Share of Tribal Population
Strategic
Location along Borders
with Neighbouring Countries
Economic and
Infrastructure Backwardness
Nonviable Nature of State Finances
Benefits:
Centre pays 90%
of the funds required in a
Centrally-Sponsored Scheme
to special category status states as
against 60% or 75% in the case of other states,
while the remaining funds are provided by the state governments.
Unspent money
in a financial year
does not lapse
and is carried forward.
Significant concessions are provided to these states in excise and customs duties, income tax and corporate tax.
30% of the Centre’s Gross Budget goes to Special Category states.
Resource Allocation:
Granting SCS entails providing additional financial assistance to the state, which can
strain the central government's resources
Dependency on Central Assistance:
States with SCS often become
heavily reliant
on central assistance discouraging efforts toward
self-sufficiency
and independent economic growth strategies.
Implementation Challenges:
Even after the grant of SCS, there might be
challenges in utilising
the funds effectively due to administrative inefficiencies,
corruption
, or lack of proper planning.
Way Forward
There is a
need to revisit and refine the criteria
for granting SCS to ensure
fairness and transparency.
set up by the Centre suggested a new methodology based on a
‘multi-dimensional index’
for devolving funds instead of a SCS, which can be r
evisited to address the State’s socio-economic backwardness.
Implement policies that
gradually reduce states' dependency on central assistance
by promoting
self-sufficiency and economic diversification
. Encourage states to generate their revenue streams.
Analysts suggest that Bihar needs a stronger rule of law for
sustainable economic growth.
Other steps need to be taken
to encourage states to
create comprehensive development plans
including:
Education Revamp:
The recommendations of the
RTE Forum
, a consortium of experts focus on improving
early childhood development
ICDS centres
), teacher training, and pedagogy shifts towards a more interactive and technology-integrated approach.
Skilling and Job Creation:
Bihar's youth bulge needs
skilled opportunities.
Focus should be on skilling initiatives aligned with growing industries, alongside fostering entrepreneurship through programs like the SIPB
(Single-window Investment Promotion Board)
to attract businesses and create a job market.
Infrastructure Development:
Improved infrastructure is crucial for overall growth. The focus should be on better irrigation systems to
tackle
, alongside developing a robust transport network to connect rural and urban areas, attracting investment and boosting agricultural trade.
Women's Empowerment and Social Inclusion:
Bihar faces challenges with
gender equality
and social stratification. Initiatives focused on
women's education
skill development
financial inclusion
alongside tackling social inequalities through stricter enforcement of laws and promoting social harmony.
Drishti Mains Question:
Q. Discuss the challenges in granting Special Category Status (SCS) to states in India. How do these challenges impact the fiscal federalism and development objectives of the country?

About Grassroot Governance in India- Panchayati Raj and Municipalities
Grassroot Governance refers to the
participation of local residents in village governance.
The main objective behind it  is that the
people in the village should undertake the responsibilities of governing themselves.
Participation from the local population, community, PRIs, SHGs, etc. helps in achieving the goals of
sustainable development and environmental preservation.
India has over 2.5 lakh gram panchayats, and over 2,000 municipalities and municipal corporations
Services like
supply of potable and clean water, sanitation, and management of solid waste are the few crucial services
provided by the local governments.
Evolution of Grassroot Governance in India
Pre Independence:
Municipal Corporation in Madras:
The setting up of a Municipal Corporation in Madras in 1687 marked the beginning of local government in India.
Charter Act of 1793:
Under this, the local body in India acquired a
statutory base and
municipal administration was established in the
presidency towns of Madras, Calcutta, and Bombay
Lord Mayo’s Resolution of 1870:
It
advocated decentralisation
and made arrangements for
strengthening the municipal institutions
involving more and more Indians in these bodies.
Lord Ripon’s Resolution of 1882:
It advocated the cause of decentralization of administration through the establishment of local selfgoverning institutions.
The Resolution of 1882 has been described as the
Magna Carta of local government.
Royal Commission on Decentralisation 1907:
It recommended that the
should be regarded as the
basic unit of local self-government institutions
every village should have a panchayat
municipalities should be constituted in urban areas
Government of India Act, 1919:
It introduced
‘Dyarchy’ in the province
local self-government became a transferred subject.
The Act increased the taxation powers of the local bodies, lowered the franchise, reduced the nominated element, and extended the communal electorate to a large number of municipalities.
Government of India Act, 1935:
For the first time,, the
introduced a federal form of Government
conferred ‘Provincial Autonomy’
on the provinces and e
nvisaged selfgovernment for the country as a whole.
Post Independence:
Balwant Rai Mehta Committee:
examine the working of the Community Development Programme (1952) and the National Extension Service (1953)
. It recommended:
Establishment of an organically linked
three-tier panchayati raj system
through a
device of indirect elections.
Ashok Mehta committee 1977: It recommended
a two-tier system – zilla parishad and mandal panchayat (consisting of a group of villages with a total population of 15,000 to 20,000)
District as first point for decentralisation
under popular supervision below the state level.

73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992:
constitutionalised the Panchayats
mandatory for all the states to set up three-tier
(in smaller states having less than 20 lakh population – two-tier) Panchayats:
Zilla Parishad at the district level
Panchayat Samiti at the block level
Gram Panchayat at the village level
74th Constitutional Amendment Act:
constitutionalised the municipal local bodies
by providing them with a constitutional status and also making it mandatory for the government to constitute them.
A uniform
three-tier structure
of urban local bodies’ viz.,
Municipal Corporation, Municipal Councils and Nagar Panchayats
was to be constituted.
Role of Panchayats in Grassroot Governance in India
Constitutional Mandate:
Indian Constitution
mandates panchayats to operate as
self-governing institutions,
urging state governments to
rejuvenate local representative bodies.
Implementing Development Policies at the Grassroots:
Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)
are crucial in translating developmental policies into action at the grassroots level.
They serve as
intermediaries between the government and rural communities
, fostering
local participation
and driving sustainable development initiatives.
Catalysts of Local Development:
Panchayats have several key responsibilities, including
drafting economic development plans and schemes,
advancing social justice through various initiatives, exercising tax, duties, tolls, and fees levying, collection, and appropriation.
It also aided in decentralising
governmental functions
, notably financial responsibilities, to local levels.
Monitoring Government Schemes:
Panchayat members supervise various government programmes, such as the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) and the
Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS)
Role of Panchayati Raj in India’s Socio-Economic Development
Rural Development:
PRIs prepare
Village Development Plans (VDPs)
implement development projects
allocating resources based on local needs
to align development initiatives with the priorities of the rural population.
Panchayats also serve as
implementing agencies for various Central and State government
programmes and schemes to help in the
targeted delivery of these programmes
Agricultural Development:
PRIs implement and oversee initiatives that boost agricultural productivity, support sustainable farming practices, and enhance the overall economic resilience of rural areas.
For instance,
cooperative endeavours like Amul
have originated at the Panchayat level.
SDG Localisation:
The MoPR is advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in collaboration with PRIs across rural India.
Providing Healthcare Facilities:
Panchayats play a significant role in providing
basic healthcare facilities
establishing and maintaining health centres
, clinics, and dispensaries.
Gram Panchayats contribute to
improving maternal and child health by promoting institutional deliveries
, encouraging prenatal and postnatal care, and reducing maternal and infant mortality rates.
From 2021-22 to 2025-26, around
0.70 lakh crore was allocated for local governments
for health, with
0.44 lakh crore specified for Rural Local Bodies (RLBs).
Education:
collaborate with schools and parents
encourage enrolment, minimise drop-out rates
actively monitor school operations
, teacher attendance, and educational quality.
Between 2018 and 2022, the
enrolment of children aged 6-14 years in government schools
increased in all States
, with Odisha, Gujarat and West Bengal recording more than 90 per cent of enrolment in government schools.
Women Empowerment:
There is a positive and significant correlation between increased women’s participation and improved outcomes in local governance.
For instance, E. Duflo and R. Chattopadhyay, in a study involving the working of PRIs in West Bengal and Rajasthan observed that
women’s representation has had a net positive impact on the delivery of local public goods to marginalised communities.
Article 243D
guarantees women’s involvement in PRIs
by stipulating a
minimum one-third reservation for women
in both the total seats filled by
direct election and the positions of Panchayat Chairpersons.

Internal (or own-source revenue):
They raise themselves, either through
taxes such as land or property tax,
or through non-tax sources which include rents and user-fees.
External Revenue Sources:
It includes:
Assigned revenue
, which covers taxes, duties, tolls, and fees due to local bodies, that are collected by the
state and central governments.
The exact percentage allocation of these revenues is done through recommendations o
f State Finance Commissions.
Grants-in-aid and loans from the central and state governments
, domestic institutions, financial intermediaries, capital markets, and/or donor agencies.
Challenges Faced by Grassroot Governance in India
Functions:
power to devolve functions to local governments
rests with the state government. However, the
states have not devolve adequate functions to local government bodies,
severely
affecting the system’s efficiency and effectiveness
Creation of Parastatal Bodies: State governments
created
parallel structures for the implementation of projects
around agriculture, health, and education—undermining areas for which local bodies are constitutionally responsible.
Non-functionality of District Planning Committees (DPC):
The 74th amendment requires a DPC to be set up in each district, so that the
development plans prepared by the panchayats and urban local bodies
can be consolidated and integrated.
However, DPC are
non-functional in nine states
failed to prepare integrated plans
in 15 states.
Finances:
Most local bodies, both rural and urban are
unable to generate adequate funds from their internal sources
, and are therefore
extremely dependent on external sources for funding.
Around 80 percent to
95 percent of revenue is obtained from external sources
, particularly state and central government loans and grants.
easons for low internal revenue collection:
Local bodie
s lack the capacity to properly impose taxes
, due to ambiguous taxation norms, lack of reliable records, and so on.
State governments have not devolved enough taxation powers.
Most states only permit local bodies to collect property taxes and water tariffs, but not land tax or tolls, which can provide more substantial revenues.
Functionaries:
According to the Standing Committee on Rural Development, there is a severe
lack of support staff and personnel in panchayats
.This affects their functioning and delivery of services by them.
Poor Infrastructure:
Around 25 percent of the
Gram Panchayats do not have basic office buildings.
The database for planning, monitoring etc., are lacking in most of the cases.
Structural deficiencies:
No secretarial support and lower levels of technical knowledge which
restricted the aggregation of bottom up planning.
Presence of Panch-Pati and Proxy representation
in case of women and SC/STs representatives respectively. (At 1.4 million, India has the most women in elected positions).
Impact of Seat Rotation on Female Political Careers:
Women representatives have identified the
policy of rotation of reserved seats every five years
as a barrier to the
continuation of their political careers
With the rotation of seats, female candidates are not able to gain from their experience from one term to the next, and they end up returning to their roles at home after a single term in office.
Concern pertaining to SFC (State Finance Commission):
Delay in Constituting SFC:
Out of 26 states, only
nine states have constituted 6th State Finance Commissions
, and out of them, only two are active. Some states have not even constituted 4th and 5th Finance Commissions.
This leads to the
local self-governments being deprived of their legitimate share
Consolidated Fund of the State.
Non-Availability of Data:
The non-availability of data related to local government hampers the workings of SFCs.
Every time an SFC is constituted, it has to start from scratch to collect data.
Lack of expertise of SFC:
The majority of the members and chairpersons of the SFCs are bureaucrats and politicians.
This puts
limitations on the ability of the SFC to act as an autonomous body
to make recommendations in a free and independent manner.
Government Initiatives to Strengthen Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)
e-Gram Swaraj e-Financial Management System:
It is a
Simplified Work Based Accounting Application for PRI
that assists in enhancing the credibility of Panchayat through inducing greater devolution of funds to PRIs.
Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) Scheme:
integrates various interventions
within the MoPR and across sectors, employing participatory local planning at the Gram Panchayat level.
Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana:
It envisions the
holistic development of villages
, transforming them into
Adarsh Grams.
Panchayat Development Index (PDI):
To measure the progress on LSDGs and to
carry out assessment to prepare evidence-based policy,
MoPR constituted a Committee to prepare mechanisms for computation of PDI.
Gram Urja Swaraj Abhiyaan:
MoPR has collaborated with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to include the Gram Panchayats under all its schemes
focusing on adoption of renewable energy.
International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):
CAG has established it as a centre of excellence for
capacity building of local government auditors
at the national and the international levels.
Best Practices in Panchayati Ra Institution Implementation
Andhra Pradesh:
It established a
village secretariat to effectuate better service delivery
broadening participatory democracy.
Karnataka:
It created a
separate bureaucratic cadre
for Panchayats to
get away from the practice of deputation of officials
who often overpowered the elected representatives.
Minimum Qualification Standards for Panchayat Elections:
States like Rajasthan and Haryana have set certain minimum qualification standards for Panchayat elections which can
help in improving the effectiveness of governance mechanisms.
Way Forward to Grassroot Governance in India
Devolving 3Fs:
State governments should make adequate efforts to
devolve funds, functions, and functionaries to panchayats
for them to
effectively plan economic development and social justice schemes.
The Standing Committee on Rural Development recommended that
states devolve subjects like fuel and fodder, non-conventional energy sources, small scale industries including food processing industries, technical training, etc. to panchayats.
Timely Establishment of State FC:
Prompt establishment of SFCs,
avoiding the sizable delays
that occur currently, assumes importance.
SFCs can strengthen the financial position of PRIs
and help them in better delivery of their responsibilities for upliftment of the rural economy.
Following Principle of Subsidiarity:
It means that
higher levels of government should perform only those functions that cannot be effectively performed at the local level.
Thus, the basic services must be provided to the citizens by the PRIs.
Local Revenue Generation:
PRIs can improve local revenue generation and use their limited resources more efficiently and effectively through measures such as
transparent budgeting
fiscal discipline, active involvement of the local community
According to National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRDPR) , the Velpur Gram Panchayat (GP) in the Nizamabad district in Telangana has demonstrated effective revenue generation from internal sources.
Social Empowerment Must Precede Political Empowerment:
Clear mechanisms to ensure that States comply with the constitutional provisions, particularly in the appointment and implementation of the recommendations of the SFCs.
Capacity Building for Self-Governance:
This includes
training to local representatives
– to
develop expertise
they contribute more in planning
implementation of policies and programmes.
Improving Participation:
state governments should put a quorum in gram sabha meetings
for participation of panchayat representatives, including women.
Technology in Local Governance:
Information and  Communication  Technology  (ICT) comprising digital tools and technologies, revolutionizes governance by
enhancing communication, transparency, service delivery, and citizen engagement.
Through  the  internet  and mobile technology, PRIs can
communicate efficiently, disseminate vital information, and engage citizens even in remote areas.
Digital platforms aid in
transparent data sharing, planning, and analysis,
while data analytics systems facilitate evidence-based decision-making.
Sampoorna Swaraj Foundation
has developed a
navigated learning system
curates
specialised learning activities
for each learner to facilitate their journey to the required level of knowledge and skill.
Conclusion
local governance system needs to be empowered in all three areas
power truly rests with the people
, not just on paper, but also in practice.

Provisions to Ensure Independence and Impartiality of Speaker:
He is provided with a
security of tenure
. He can be removed only by a resolution passed by the Lok Sabha by a effective majority.
His
salaries and allowances

sixth rank
order of precedence
along with the
Chief Justice of India
What are the Roles and Responsibilities of the Speaker?
Presiding Over House Proceedings:
oversees the sessions
of the Lower House,
ensuring discipline and decorum
among members.
The Speaker decides the
agenda for parliamentary meetings
and interprets procedural rules. He/she permits motions such as
adjournments, no-confidence and censure motions
, ensuring orderly conduct.

power to punish unruly behaviour
and even disqualify members on grounds of defection under
10
schedule
of the constitution.
Constitution of Committees:
The Committees of the House are
constituted by the speaker

Partisanship Issue:
The Speaker, often belonging to the ruling party, are
accused of bias
. Supreme Court in
Kihoto Hollohan versus Zachilhu case
highlighted the instances where speakers have allegedly acted in favour of their party.
For example,
discretionary powers
of speakers with political affiliations  in
deciding money bill and political defection cases
is one such example.
In 2017,
the Manipur legislative assembly anti-defection case
, the court gave a reasonable period of four weeks but the
defection complaint was pending for years.
Prioritising Party Interests over National Interest:
Speakers have the power to
restrict debates or discussions

Increased Disruptions and Stalling of Proceedings:
A Speaker
perceived as biased
can lead to
frustration and disruptions from the opposition
ultimately hindering the functioning of Parliament.
Bypassing Committees and Scrutiny:
Rushing through bills without proper committee review can lead to
poorly crafted legislation
that hasn't received sufficient deliberation.
Example:
The instance of the
passing of
3 farm laws
in 2020
without referring it to parliamentary committe has been
cited as the reason by opposition for widespread protest and later their withdrawal
Way Forward
Maintaining Stability:
The Speaker's
impartiality and fairness
are critical, as they have to balance the complex dynamics of diverse political interests
Their decisions on issues such as the
admission of no-confidence motions, the allocation of time for debates, and the recognition of members
can have a significant impact on the government's stability.
Role in Resolving Disputes:
In the case of a coalition government, where multiple parties with
different ideologies and agendas
come together, conflicts and disputes are inevitable.
The Speaker should uphold impartiality in
mediating these disputes
and finding solutions that are acceptable to all stakeholders.
Impact on Legislative Outcomes:
By controlling the legislative agenda, the Speaker can
influence the passage of bills
overall policy direction
of the government.
Pranab Mukherjee, former President of India
, noted, "
The Speaker's role is not just about running the House; it's about being a bridge between the government and the opposition, and ensuring that the democratic process is upheld
."
Ensuring Non-Partisanship:
The practice of the
Speaker who resigns from their political party to ensure complete non-partisanship
can be explored further to uphold the Constitution's
principle of separation of powers
The example of
N. Sanjiva Reddy resigning from his party upon becoming Speaker in 1967
sets a positive precedent of non-partisanship.
In Britain, the speaker is strictly a
nonparty member
. There is a convention that the
speaker has to resign from his party and remain politically neutral.
Conclusion
The Speaker of Lok Sabha is not just a presiding officer, they
wield significant power in shaping the functioning of the House
and influencing the balance between the ruling party and the opposition,especially in the case of coalition government. The Speaker's decisions and actions can have
far-reaching consequences for the functioning and stability
Drishti Mains Question:
Q. Highlighting the powers and responsibilities of the speaker in Indian parliamentary system,discuss about its crucial role in ensuring parliamentary democracy.

This article sheds light on the proportional representation method of election and its possible impact on the recent
2024 Lok Sabha election results.
Analyzing Proportional Representation in 2024 Lok Sabha Election
The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won 293 seats with a 43.3% vote share.
The Opposition bloc INDIA, including the Trinamool Congress, secured 234 seats with a 41.6% vote share.
Other regional parties and independents got around 15% of the votes.
Despite their vote share, these regional parties and independents only won 16 seats in total.

What is Proportional Representation?
The Proportional Representation (PR) system ensures that all parties are represented based on their vote share. This method ensures fair representation for all political parties according to their vote share. The key feature of this system is that every vote impacts the outcome, not just those forming a majority or a plurality.
Use of PR system in other countries
Presidential Democracies:
Countries like Brazil and Argentina use the party list PR system.
Parliamentary Democracies:
South Africa, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain also follow the party list PR system.
Main Types of Proportional Representation
Party-list PR:
Voters cast their votes for parties, not individual candidates.
Parties receive seats in proportion to their vote share.
If a party gets n% of the vote, it will win approximately n% of the seats.
Every vote counts toward the final result, not just the majority or plurality.
There is typically a minimum threshold (3-5% of the vote) for a party to gain any seats.
Types of Lists:
Closed Lists:
Voters can only vote for parties, not individual candidates.
Open Lists
: Voters can express preferences for individual candidates and vote for independents.
District Sizes:
Can vary from small (e.g., three seats in Chile or Ireland) to large (e.g., a province or entire nation).
Single Transferable Vote (STV):
This system uses multi-member districts.
Voters rank candidates in order of preference.
Votes are transferred as candidates are elected or eliminated to ensure no vote is wasted.
Benefits:
Allows voters to choose candidates across party lines.
Ensures that votes for independent candidates or less popular candidates are not wasted.
Mixed Member Proportional Representation (MMP)
Alternative Name:
Also called the Additional Member System (AMS).
MMPR combines FPTP and PR systems.
Voters have two votes: one for a single-member district candidate and one for a party list.
The party list vote determines the overall balance of seats for each party.
How Does It Work?
Each territorial constituency elects one candidate through FPTP.
Additional seats are allocated based on the percentage of votes each party receives.
This system aims to maintain stability while ensuring fair representation.
Benefits for India
The MMPR system could provide stability in India’s parliamentary democracy.
It would ensure fair representation for all parties based on their vote share.

Proportional RepreImplementing Sentation in India
As a federal country, India should implement the PR system at the State/Union Territory (UT) level.
<img alt="Proportional Representation" class="wp-image-113126 alignright" decoding="async" height="139" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" src="https://pwonlyias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unnamed-80-666814a43a4ba.webp" srcset="https://pwonlyias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unnamed-80-666814a43a4ba.webp 512w, https://pwonlyias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/unnamed-80-666814a43a4ba-300x84.webp 300w" width="498"/>
If the PR system were applied to the 2024 election results at the State/UT level, the distribution of seats would be different (see Table 2 for details).
Impact on Representation
The PR system would align party representation with their vote share.
Example 1: In Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh (66 seats total), the NDA won 64 seats with 62%, 60%, and 53% vote shares, respectively.
Under PR, the INDIA bloc would have won 23 seats in these states.
Example 2: In Odisha, the Biju Janata Dal (classified as ‘Others’) with a 42% vote share would have secured nine seats instead of none under FPTP.
Example 3: In Tamil Nadu, the NDA and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (classified as ‘Others’) would have won seats, as the INDIA bloc secured all 39 seats with just a 47% vote share under FPTP.
Criticisms of the Proportional Representation System
Instability:
PR might lead to instability, as no party or coalition may achieve a majority to form a government.
Proliferation of Parties:
It could encourage the formation of parties based on regional, caste, religious, and linguistic lines, potentially promoting casteist or communal voting patterns.
This criticism is less valid since the current FPTP system also hasn’t prevented the formation of such parties.
A minimum vote threshold can be set to qualify parties for seats, addressing this issue.

Comparison between FPTP and PR
Criteria
Goal
Elect a representative for each district
Proportionally represent voters’ preferences
Method
Candidate with most votes wins the district
Seats allocated based on party’s overall vote share
Advantages
Simple to understand. It works well for a large country like India and provides greater stability to the executive branch.
Fairer representation of voters’ preferences
Disadvantages
May not reflect overall popular vote
May lead to coalition governments

Agnipath Scheme
Source: IE
Why in News?
The ruling-party government’s ambitious
Agnipath scheme
, announced in June 2022, has been facing opposition from various political parties and Armed Forces veterans.
Ongoing concerns highlight the scheme’s impact on military recruitment and the welfare of soldiers.
What is Agnipath Scheme?
About:
The term "
Agniveer"
translates to "Fire-Warriors" and is a
new military rank.
It is a scheme of
recruiting army personnel below officer ranks
such as
soldiers, airmen, and sailors
who are not commissioned officers to the
Indian Armed Forces.
They are recruited for a period of
4 years
, after which,
upto 25%
of these recruits (called Agniveers), can join the services on a
permanent commission
(another 15 years), subject to merit and organisational requirements.
At present,
all sailors, airmen, and soldiers,
except the technical cadre of the medical branch, are recruited to the services under this scheme.
Eligibility Criteria:
Candidates between the age of
17.5 years to 23 years
are eligible to apply (the upper age limit was increased from 21).
Girls under the given age limit are open for the agnipath entry,
while there is no such reservation for women under this scheme.
Pay & Benefits:
Death on Duty
: The family gets a combined sum of
Rs 1 crore
, which includes both the
Seva Nidhi package
and the soldier's unserved salary.
Disability
: An Agniveer can receive compensation up to
Rs 44 lakh
depending on the severity of the disability. This amount is provided
only if the disability is caused
by or worsened due to military service.
Pensions
: Agniveers won't receive a regular pension after their 4-year service, unlike soldiers in the traditional system.
Only the 25%
who get selected for permanent commission will be eligible for a pension.
Goal of Agnipath
This scheme is designed to
keep the armed forces young
bring down the number of permanent soldiers in the military,
leading to a significant reduction in the government's pension spending on defense forces.
Why was the Agnipath Scheme Introduced?
Younger, Fitter Force:
The government believes Agnipath will create a
more agile fighting force
due to the emphasis on younger recruits, translating to faster response times and better adaptation on the battlefield.
The average age in the Armed Forces, currently
32 years,
will be reduced to
26 years
with Agnipath's implementation.
Reduce Pension Bill
: It also aims to
lessen the burden of the ever-growing defense
pension bill.
Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence report
in 2022 projected the Indian Armed Forces' pension bill to reach a staggering
Rs 2.5 lakh crore
by 2025.
Agnipath, with
its shorter service
duration for most recruits, could potentially help manage this expenditure.
Technological Integration
: The scheme aims to
leverage the tech-savviness of younger recruits
to better integrate emerging technologies into the Armed Forces.
Skilled Workforce for Civilian Sector:
The government envisions Agniveers transitioning to the civilian workforce with
valuable skills and discipline gained during their service.
This could potentially contribute to a more skilled national workforce and economic growth.
More Employment Opportunities:
It will increase employment opportunities and because of the skills and experience
acquired during the four-year service such soldiers
will get employment in various fields.
What are the Issues Associated with Agnipath Scheme?
Lack of Retirement Benefits:
The scheme provides a one-time payment of
Rs 11.71 lakh
on completion of 4-year tenure,
but no gratuity or pension.
This has caused
widespread discontent among aspirants
who were seeking job security and pension benefits.
Short Service Duration
4-year term is seen as inadequate,
with concerns that recruits may
lack the same motivation and training as permanent soldiers.
Also, this duration is
insufficient to train and skill soldiers in the long term
as it may lead to
skill and experience deficit
in armed forces.
Age Limit Issues:
The current upper age limit of
excluded many youth
who could not apply due to lack of recruitment during the pandemic.
Unemployment Concerns
: With
limited permanent absorption (only 25%),
the scheme is seen as
exacerbating the already high youth unemployment
in the country.
This comes amidst wider economic challenges like rising inflation and inequalities.
Perceived Political Motives
: Experts believe the
scheme was rushed through without adequate consultation,
possibly as a political move ahead of elections. The lack of endorsement from defense forces also raises doubts.
Pension Bill Reduction:
The scheme is seen as a way for the government to reduce its rising defense pension expenditure,
prioritizing financial savings over long-term force building.
Way Forward
Raising the Age Limit and Permanent Retention Quota
: There should be a longer
service period to 7-8 years for Agniveers.
Also, the
entry age for technical roles should be increased to 23 years,
regular service retention rate
for Agniveers should be increased from current 25% to 60-70%.
Enhanced Entitlements and Benefits
: Agniveers should be
provided with a
contributory pension scheme, generous gratuity, and ex-gratia
for disability during training.
They should be offered
opportunities in other security forces, veteran status
, and preference for government jobs, with a
transparent, merit-based system
for retaining Agniveers.
Implement Robust Skilling and Resettlement Programs
comprehensive skilling and resettlement programs
should be developed
in collaboration with the private sector
and government agencies to facilitate a smooth transition for Agniveers into civilian life.
A legislation should
also be made that mandates the compulsory absorption
of Agniveers by private employers and corporations.
Raising Educational Standards
: The educational
requirements for Agniveers to should be raised from 10 to 10+2
and a more rigorous national entrance exam should be implemented.
Conclusion
The Agnipath scheme in India is a major reform in defense policy that
changes the recruitment process for armed forces
. Initial implementation shows positive signs in the motivation, intelligence, and physical standards of Agniveers recruited under the scheme. Human element is
deemed more important than technological advancements in militar
y operations, highlighting the need for character development and psychological well-being of Agniveers to align with unit pride and cohesion.
Drishti Mains Question:
Discuss the significance and challenges of the Agniveer Scheme introduced by the Indian government for recruitment in the armed forces. What measures can ensure its success?

Relevance:
GS II: Government Policies and Interventions
Dimensions of the Article:
Background of the Court’s Ruling
MPLAD Scheme
2018 CIC Order:
The Central Information Commission (CIC) raised concerns about Members of Parliament (MPs) strategically saving their MPLADS funds until the final year of their term. The CIC suspected this tactic was used to gain an unfair advantage during elections.
MoSPI Suggestion:
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) was advised by the CIC to prevent this “abuse” by implementing guidelines to ensure the funds were distributed equally over each year of the five-year term.
Legal Challenge:
The MoSPI filed a legal challenge in the Delhi High Court against the CIC’s ruling related to a Right to Information (RTI) application.
No Jurisdiction:
The Delhi High Court ruled that the CIC does not have jurisdiction to comment on the utilization of funds by MPs under the MPLADS.
RTI Act Scope:
The court noted that the RTI Act is limited to providing access to information under the control of public authorities.
Section 18 of RTI Act:
According to Section 18 of the RTI Act, the CIC can only deal with issues related to the information sought under the RTI Act or any issue leading to the dissipation of such information.
Publication of Details:
The Court upheld the CIC’s instruction for public authorities to publish details of the funds, MP-wise, Constituency-wise, and work-wise under the RTI Act.
MPLAD Scheme:
MPLADS is an ongoing
Central Sector Scheme
which was launched in 1993-94.  The Scheme enables the Members of Parliament to recommend works for creation of durable community assets based on locally felt needs to be taken up in their constituencies in the area of national priorities namely drinking water, education, public health, sanitation, roads etc.
Nodal Ministry:
The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has been responsible for the policy formulation, release of funds and prescribing monitoring mechanism for implementation of the Scheme.

MPs are to recommend every year, works costing at least 15 per cent of the MPLADS entitlement for the year for areas inhabited by Scheduled Caste population and 7.5 per cent for areas inhabited by S.T. population.
In order to encourage trusts and societies for the betterment of tribal people, a ceiling of Rs. 75 lakh is stipulated for building assets by trusts and societies subject to conditions prescribed in the scheme guidelines.
Lok Sabha Members
can recommend works within their Constituencies and
Elected Members of Rajya Sabha
can recommend works within the State of Election (with select exceptions).
Nominated Members
of both the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha can recommend works anywhere in the country.
All works to meet locally felt infrastructure and development needs, with an emphasis on creation of durable assets in the constituency are permissible under MPLADS as prescribed in the scheme guidelines.
Expenditure on specified items of non durable nature are also permitted as listed in the guidelines.
Release of Funds:
Funds are released in the form of grants in-aid directly to the district authorities.
The funds released under the scheme are non-lapsable.
The liability of funds not released in a particular year is carried forward to the subsequent years, subject to eligibility.

When and Why was the NOTA Option Introduced?
New Record:
The extraordinary result in Indore is the
most votes that the “None Of The Above” (NOTA) option
has ever received in any constituency to date.
The previous NOTA record-holder was
Gopalganj, Bihar, in 2019
, when 51,660 voters chose this option.
Introduction of NOTA:
Supreme Court
directed the
Election Commission of India (ECI)
to introduce the
NOTA option for voters in September 2013
, in order to protect the
secrecy of voters’ choice.
Voters Right to Secrecy:
In 2004 the
People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL)
had approached the apex court seeking directions to the ECI for measures to protect the
‘right to secrecy’ of voters
to exercise their franchise.
They argued that the
Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961
violated the secrecy aspect as the Presiding Officer (from the ECI) maintains a record of
voters who choose not to vote
along with the signatures or thumb impressions of each voter who exercises this right.
The central government, however, argued that the right to vote is “
pure and simple a statutory right
” (as it is provided by a law, and not the Constitution), and only voters who exercised their
right to vote have a right to secrecy
as well, not those who have not voted at all.
three-judge Bench,
comprising Chief Justice of India P Sathasivam, and Justices Ranjana Prakash Desai and Ranjan Gogoi, however, held that “Whether a voter decides to cast his vote or decides not to cast his vote, in both cases,
secrecy has to be maintained.”
Especially in elections to Lok Sabha and state legislatures, the court held tha
t secrecy is an essential feature of free and fair elections
and “No discernible public interest shall be served by disclosing the elector’s vote or his identity.”
Moreover, with the
introduction of EVMs
, the court noted that anyone present in the polling booth would know if a voter has decided not to vote, as the machine would not emit any light or sound (as it does when a vote is cast).
The court noted that the ECI in 2001 sent a letter to the
Ministry of Law and Justice
seeking the introduction of a NOTA option in EVMs and ballot papers to protect voter secrecy as well as allow voters to “express his
dissent/disapproval against the contesting candidates
and will have the benefit of reducing bogus voting.”

What happens if NOTA Receives the Highest Number of Votes in a Constituency?
Currently, the apex court is considering another petition for
elections to be considered “null and void”
if NOTA receives the highest number of votes in the constituency.
Shiv Khera, author and the founder of the Country First Foundation, approached the court in April 2024 seeking directions to the ECI to frame guidelines/rules regarding
uniform implementation of the NOTA
vote option with
consequences for candidates
who do not surpass NOTA.”
As Assistant Solicitor General PP Malhotra pointed out to the court,
NOTA has no legal consequence
attached to it – even if the highest number of votes in a seat are polled for NOTA, the second most successful candidate wins.
This has never happened (in Lok Sabha elections), but the Indore result, as well as other local body elections, show that it
remains a distinct possibility.
The court accepted this reasoning and the suggestion from the ECI’s letter, stating that political parties would be “forced to accept the will of the people and field candidates who are known for their integrity”, and
directed the ECI to install a NOTA button in EVMs.
The petition invokes
Maharashtra, Haryana, Puducherry, Delhi, and Chandigarh
as examples of states and union territories where the
State Election Commission
passed orders declaring NOTA as a “
Fictional Electoral Candidate
” in local elections (including elections for panchayats and municipal bodies).
If the votes for NOTA exceed the votes received by all other individual candidates,
fresh elections will be held
in these states and union territories.
Khera argues that the ECI should frame
similar rules for all elections
where NOTA gets a majority of the vote.
According to his petition, the introduction of NOTA in 2013
“has not fulfilled its purpose”
as it has not led to increased voter participation or political parties fielding good candidates.
NOTA is a “
potent weapon in the hands of the voter
” and requires “teeth” to put pressure on political parties, according to the petition.
It also states that candidates who poll fewer votes than NOTA should be “
debarred from contesting all elections for a period of 5 years
” and requests the Supreme Court to direct the ECI to frame rules for this as well.

About Special Category Status (SCS)
is a
designation conferred by  the central government to
aid states with geographical and socio-economic challenges.
Introduction: It was introduced
​​In 1969, based on the recommendations of the
Fifth Finance Commission
of India.
Criteria for granting SCS:
Difficult and hilly terrain
Low population density and/ or a sizable tribal population
Strategic location along borders
Economic and infrastructural backwardness
Non-viable nature of state finances
Financial Grants:
Under the
Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
allocated approximately 30% of total central assistance to Special Category Status (SCS) States.
However, with the abolition of the Planning Commission and changes in funding mechanisms, assistance is now part of the increased devolution of divisible pool funds for all states (increased to 41% in the 15th Finance Commission from 32%).
Centre- State Funding for schemes:
In SCS States, the funding ratio for centrally sponsored  schemes is favorable at 90:10  (Centre-State), compared to the 60:40 or 80:20 splits for general category states.
Schemes such as
Incentives for Investments:
Several incentives to attract investments, including concessions in customs and excise duties, income tax, and corporate tax rates.
Debt Management Privileges:
These states can avail the benefit of debt-swapping and debt relief schemes by increasing the time period or giving exemption in interest rates.
Carry forward provisions for Unspent Funds:
Special category states enjoyed the provision where unspent funds in a fiscal year would not expire but instead be carried forward to the subsequent fiscal year.
For Example:
If the center allocates 1000 crore for a special category state for a particular financial year, the unused funds can be carried forward to the next financial year. In contrast, for a general category state, the unused funds lapse.
Initial States with SCS (1969):
Jammu, Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland in 1969.
Current states with SCS:  Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram,
Uttarakhand
were granted this status
Telangana, the newest state of India accorded status.

Disagreement over Criteria:
States disagree on the criteria for awarding Special Category Status (SCS).
Uttarakhand, a Himalayan state bordering China, was granted SCS, while Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh were not awarded the same status despite lagging behind Uttarakhand in various growth indicators.
Inter-State Disparities:
Providing special status to specific states could
raise concerns about unequal economic and social structures
, potentially exacerbating inter-state disparities.
Promotes Fiscal Irresponsibility:
Debt-swapping and debt-relief initiatives indirectly incentivize states to exceed their capacity for servicing debt, resulting in prolonged liabilities.
For instance, in Jammu and Kashmir, outstanding guarantees represent 20% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), while in Himachal Pradesh, it stands at 10%.
Demand Chain Reaction:
Giving special status to
one state often prompts others to seek
the same, leading to a series of requests and reducing the intended benefits.
For Instanc
e: In November 2023 the Bihar Government (Cabinet) passed a resolution seeking the grant of special category status (SCS) to Bihar.
Abolition:
14th Finance Commission abolished most states ‘special category status’,
retaining it only for the Northeastern states and three hill states.
Reasons for Abolishing Special Category Status Since 2014
Enhanced Devolution:
The 14th Finance Commission raised the vertical devolution to states to 42%, up from 32% in the 13th Finance Commission.
Revised Formula:
The 14th Finance Commission introduced factors such as
“Forest and ecology” into the formula for horizontal devolution,
so states with hilly and challenging terrain might see an uptick in devolution from the central government.
Additional Grants:
Apart from tax devolution, the Finance Commission recommends grants for local bodies, disaster management, revenue deficit, and other specified areas outlined in the government’s Terms of Reference.
Special Assistance:
The central government extends support to states through mechanisms such as GST compensation to offset any tax revenue losses incurred due to the adoption of the GST system and interest-free loans for capital expenditure, lasting up to 50 years.
Why is Andhra Pradesh Demanding Special Category Status?
Bifurcation of the State:
Since its
division in 2014
, Andhra Pradesh has sought Special Category Status, citing
revenue loss resulting from the transfer of Hyderabad to Telangana
Higher Grant-in-Aid:
SCS would mean higher grants-in-aid to the state government from the Centre.
To illustrate, per capita grants to Special Category States is Rs 5,573 crore per year, whereas AP receives only Rs 3,428 crore.
Increase Employment: The governments of AP have argued that such special incentives are vital for the rapid industrialisation of the primarily agrarian state and would improve employment opportunities for the youth and the
overall development of the state.
Encouraging Investments:
Granting SCS would encourage investments in speciality hospitals, five-star hotels, manufacturing industries, high-value service industries such as IT, and premier institutions of higher education and research.

Consensus on Criteria:
A critical need for a general  consensus among states regarding the principles guiding the grant of Special Category Status (SCS).
Economic Policy integration:
While SCS benefits act as a stimulus, the real impact rests on individual  state economic policies.
State Capacity Empowerment:
States should recognize their industrial strengths, fostering a  policy environment for self-reliance rather than excessive reliance on central support.
Alternative Approach:
Explore alternative approaches like the one suggested by the Raghuram Rajan Committee, emphasizing a ‘
multi-dimensional index’
for fund allocation.
In 2013, the Raghuram Rajan Committee set up by the Centre,
placed Bihar in the “least
developed category”
and suggested a new methodology based on a
‘multi -dimensional index’
for devolving funds instead of a SCS, which can be revisited to address the State’s socio-economic backwardness.
