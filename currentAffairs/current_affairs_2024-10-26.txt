**********Great Eared Nightjar
The Great Eared Nightjar is one of the most mesmerizing creatures, due to its striking resemblance with a mythical dragon, especially when perched.
About Great Eared Nightjar
:
The name 'nightjar' comes from the
bird's nocturnal habits
and the fact that its calls are often described as jarring.
Their diet usually consists of smaller insects. Instead of making nests really high up on trees, they typically roost on the ground or low branches.
Nightjars are well known for their silent flight, which is due to the structure of their feathers. Hence they can easily sneak up on their prey and also move away without anyone noticing, if faced with a potential threat.
Unlike other birds, the Great Eared Nightjar lays its eggs directly on the floor instead of building a nest.
Habitat:
These birds prefer to dwell in thick forests, woodlands and mangroves. Since they are nocturnal, you can catch them flying only at dusk or dawn, searching for food.
Distribution:
The Nightjar can be found roaming the skies from parts of
India and Sri Lanka to the Malay Peninsula, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
Conservation status
IUCN: Least Concern
Threat:
Due to rapid loss in their habitat, they are under threat.

**********Bhu-Aadhaar
According to data available on the rural development ministry’s portal, around 30 percent of the rural land parcels in the country have been given a Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) or Bhu-Aadhaar.
About Bhu-Aadhaar:
is also known as
(ULPIN).
ULPIN was
launched in 2021
as part of the Central government’s Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP).
It aims to streamline and bring uniformity to the process adopted by states in assigning unique identification numbers to land parcels.
It is accorded to a land parcel based on the
longitude and latitude coordinates
of the land parcel and depends on detailed surveys and geo-referenced cadastral maps.
Under this initiative a
14-digit alpha-numeric identity
is given to each land parcel.
It contains State code, District code, Sub-district code, Village code and a Unique plot ID number.
Once the ULPIN or Bhu-Aadhaar is generated, it is stamped on the physical land record document held by the owner.
The same ULPIN will be permanently attached to the plot of land. Even if the land is transferred, sub-divided, or undergoes any change, the
ULPIN will remain the same
for that geographic boundary.
Key objectives of ULPIN/Bhu-Aadhaar are
To assign a unique ID to each plot of land for easy
identification and retrieval of records.
To create accurate digital land records with details of land owners, plot boundaries, area, usage, etc.
To link land records and property registration processes
To facilitate online delivery of land record services
To assist in government planning by maintaining updated land data

**********The right to die with dignity — SC rulings and what the law says in India
Why in news?
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has released draft guidelines to implement the Supreme Court's 2018 and 2023 orders on the right to die with dignity.  These guidelines provide a framework for state governments and hospitals to withdraw life support for terminally ill patients.
Though India lacks specific legislation on life-sustaining treatment withdrawal, the guidelines affirm its legality within this regulated structure.
What’s in today’s article?
Understanding Withholding or Withdrawing Life-Sustaining Treatment
Euthanasia or the so called ‘mercy killing’ of a patient
Living Will
Medical Procedure for Withholding or Withdrawing Life-Sustaining Treatment
About
Withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment involves ending medical interventions, such as ventilators and feeding tubes, when they no longer improve the patient’s condition or merely extend suffering.
These treatments temporarily replace essential bodily functions but are discontinued to allow natural progression of the illness, providing comfort care and symptomatic relief instead.
Right to Refuse Medical Treatment
The right to refuse medical treatment has long been upheld in common law and is recognized as a fundamental right under Article 21 (Right to life and personal liberty) of the Indian Constitution following the 2018 Supreme Court decision in
Common Cause vs Union of India
This right allows patients to refuse life-sustaining treatments, even if refusal may lead to death.
Process for Withholding or Withdrawing Life Support
Through Patient Consent
: If a patient has decision-making capacity, they can refuse treatment.
Through Advance Directives or ‘Living Wills’
: A patient may outline their wishes in a ‘living will’ to guide future medical care if they lose the ability to decide.
For Patients Without Capacity or Living Will
: In cases where a patient cannot make decisions and lacks a living will, the treating physician can recommend withholding or withdrawing treatment if there is no reasonable chance of recovery, and further intervention would only prolong dying.
Understanding Euthanasia and Misconceptions Around “Passive Euthanasia” in India
Euthanasia involves the intentional ending of a terminally ill patient’s life by a doctor to relieve suffering.
In India, “passive euthanasia” often
refers to withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment
, but this term has led to misconceptions and public apprehension regarding the right to die with dignity.
A 2018 glossary by the Indian Council of Medical Research highlighted that this term is widely misunderstood and lacks social acceptability.
Withholding or Withdrawal of Life Support and Do-Not-Attempt-Resuscitation (DNAR) Orders
The withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments can include “do-not-attempt-resuscitation” (DNAR) orders, where a physician decides, in consultation with the patient or family, not to attempt resuscitation.
Importantly, DNAR does not mean stopping other medical treatment; it only limits resuscitation efforts.
Does Withholding or Withdrawing Treatment Mean Giving Up on the Patient?
Choosing not to continue life-sustaining treatment is not about abandoning the patient but about recognizing when interventions are futile and only prolong suffering.
In such cases, the focus shifts to palliative care, ensuring the patient’s comfort.
In contrast, discharging patients against medical advice often results in inadequate care, increasing suffering for patients and their families.
To support the right to die with dignity,
the Supreme Court established guidelines in 2018 for creating living wills, later simplified in 2023
A living will allows individuals aged 18 or older to outline their medical care preferences should they lose decision-making capacity.
The document must name at least two trusted surrogate decision-makers.
To be legally binding,
it must be signed before an executor, two witnesses, and attested by a notary or gazetted officer
Guidelines by SC
The Supreme Court's guidelines outlined a structured procedure for withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment.
It emphasized the rights and duties of both doctors and patients and ensuring independent expert assessment and consent from family or surrogate decision-makers.
Primary Medical Board Assessment
A Primary Medical Board, consisting of the treating doctor and two subject-matter experts with a minimum of five years’ experience, is constituted by the hospital.
This board assesses the patient’s condition and determine the appropriateness of stopping life-sustaining treatment.
Secondary Medical Board Review
For additional oversight, a Secondary Medical Board is set up to review the Primary Board’s decision.
It includes a registered medical practitioner appointed by the district Chief Medical Officer and two experienced subject-matter experts, all different from those on the Primary Board.
Consent from Family or Surrogate Decision-Makers
Consent from the patient’s nominated representatives in an advance directive or, where unavailable, surrogate decision-makers is required before withholding or withdrawing treatment.
Judicial Notification
The hospital must notify the local judicial magistrate about the decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment.
Shared Decision-Making and Ethical Responsibility of Doctors
The procedure promotes “
shared decision-making,”
involving the medical team and the patient’s family or surrogates to jointly agree on treatment decisions.
This protects doctors legally, respects patient autonomy, includes family wishes, and maintains ethical standards without placing sole responsibility on the physician.

**********How passive euthanasia works in India?
Indian Society
Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Health Care; Passive Euthanasia; Palliative Care;
Why in the News?
Min. of Health and Family Welfare issued draft Guidelines for the withdrawal of life support in terminally ill Patients, aimed at implementing the Supreme Court’s 2018 and 2023 rulings that uphold the right to die with dignity for all Indians.
What is Passive euthanasia?
Passive euthanasia involves allowing a terminally ill patient to die naturally by withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments, like ventilators when they no longer provide benefits.
What are the draft guidelines released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare?
The guidelines
to operationalize the Supreme Court’s 2018 and 2023 orders, which recognize the right to die with dignity as part of
Article 21
of the Indian Constitution.
Key Mechanisms Proposed
Primary and Secondary Medical Boards
: Hospitals are required to set up these boards to determine when further medical treatment for a terminally ill patient would no longer be beneficial.
Nomination of Doctors
: District Chief Medical Officers will nominate doctors to serve on Secondary Medical Boards to confirm or reject the Primary Medical Board’s recommendations.
While
India does not have dedicated legislation
on withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, these guidelines and the Supreme Court’s judgments provide a defined legal framework to make these actions lawful.
What is meant by withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatment?
It refers to discontinuing medical interventions, such as ventilators or feeding tubes, when they no longer contribute to the patient’s recovery or only prolong suffering.
Life-sustaining treatments replace essential bodily functions artificially
(e.g., mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition).
The intention is to allow the underlying illness to take
its natural course
while providing comfort care, focusing on symptomatic relief and palliative care.
The right to refuse medical treatment is recognized under common law and is considered part of India’s
fundamental right to life
personal liberty (Article 21)
Is Withholding/Withdrawing treatment akin to giving up on the patient?
Withholding or withdrawing treatment does not mean the doctor is giving up on the patient. It is an acknowledgment that continued medical intervention may no longer be beneficial and could cause unnecessary suffering.
The process involves shifting the focus from life-sustaining measures to palliative care to manage pain and ensure the patient’s comfort.
Often, doctors practice “
discharge against medical advice
” because of misconceptions about the legality of withholding/withdrawing treatment. This practice leads to patients suffering without appropriate care.
What medical procedure is laid down by the SC and reaffirmed by the guidelines?
Primary Medical Board assessment
: A hospital-level board, including the treating doctor and two experienced experts, evaluates the patient’s condition to recommend withholding/withdrawing treatment.
Secondary Medical Board review
: A different board, nominated by the district Chief Medical Officer, reviews the Primary Board’s decision for an additional level of checks.
Consent and Judicial notification
: Consent from the patient’s surrogate decision-makers or advance directive nominees is required, and the decision must be notified to the local judicial magistrate.
Way forward:
Public Awareness and Training
: Educate the public and healthcare professionals about the legal framework for end-of-life care, emphasizing the distinction between withholding treatment and euthanasia, to reduce misconceptions.
Strengthen Palliative Care Services
: Expand access to palliative care across hospitals and healthcare facilities, ensuring that terminally ill patients receive compassionate and effective pain management and comfort care.

: Many protected areas focus only on specific species rather than the entire ecosystem, failing to prioritize overall biodiversity intactness.
Pre-existing Degradation
: Some protected areas may have been already degraded before being designated as protected, limiting their effectiveness in conserving biodiversity.
External Threats
: Activities such as oil, gas, and mining concessions encroach on protected areas, leading to habitat destruction and further biodiversity loss.
Climate Crisis Impact
: Increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as droughts and wildfires, has severely affected protected areas, undermining their conservation efforts.
Steps taken by the Indian Government to conserve biodiversity:
Legislative Framework
Biological Diversity Act, 2002:
Established to conserve biological resources and regulate access to these resources, ensuring equitable sharing of benefits derived from their use.
Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972:
Facilitates the creation of Protected Areas for wildlife conservation and imposes penalties for illegal hunting.
Conservation Policies:
Project Tiger:
Launched in 1973, this initiative aims to protect tiger populations across designated reserves.
Project Elephant:
Initiated in 1992, it focuses on the management and protection of wild elephant populations and their habitats.
National Biodiversity Mission:
A mission mode initiative aimed at documenting and conserving India’s biodiversity.
Establishment of a Protected Area Network:
This includes National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves, and Community Reserves to provide better protection for wildlife and their habitats.
Designation of Biosphere Reserves:
These reserves are aimed at conserving representative ecosystems.
What should be done? (Way forward)
Ecosystem-Centric Management
: Shift focus from individual species to the overall health of ecosystems to ensuring comprehensive protection of habitats and their interdependent species.
Strengthened Protection and Regulation
: Implement stricter regulations to limit industrial activities (e.g., oil and gas exploration) within and around protected areas, alongside enforcing more robust land-use policies.
Community Engagement and Education
: Involve local communities in conservation efforts and enhance public awareness about biodiversity’s importance, fostering a collective responsibility for sustainable practices.

Note4Students
From UPSC perspective, the following things are important :
Mains level:
Carbon market;
Why in the News?
In preparation for the 29th edition of the COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, next month, there is renewed momentum within government circles to expedite the transition of Indian industry to carbon markets.
What is meant by the Carbon Trade Policy?
It is a market-based approach to control pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants.
It sets a quantitative limit on emissions, by allowing member countries with lower emissions to sell rights to emit carbon to higher-emitting entities, promoting cost-effective carbon reduction.
Why India must develop a transparent Carbon Trade Policy?
A clear and transparent policy will boost investor confidence,
attracting both domestic and foreign investments
in green technologies and carbon-reduction projects.
Establishing robust verification and reporting mechanisms
will enhance the integrity
of carbon credits, preventing issues like double counting and greenwashing, and fostering trust among stakeholders.
A transparent policy will help align India’s efforts with
global climate commitments
, enabling effective tracking of emissions reductions and promoting sustainable economic growth.
How effective is ‘Fair Trade’ in achieving its Goals?
Promotion of Sustainable Practices
: Just as Fair Trade supports environmentally sustainable agriculture practices, carbon markets incentivize companies to adopt greener technologies and reduce emissions. Both aim to create a more sustainable future.
Empowerment of Stakeholders
: Fair Trade empowers marginalized producers by providing fair prices and market access, similar to how carbon markets can benefit developing countries like India by enabling them to sell carbon credits generated from emissions reductions.
Economic Benefits
: Fair Trade aims to create economic stability for producers, while carbon markets can generate revenue for countries that invest in carbon-reduction projects, creating a financial incentive for participating in emissions trading.
Global Impact Awareness
: Both Fair Trade and carbon markets raise awareness about global issues—Fair Trade regarding trade equity and carbon markets regarding climate change, fostering a sense of responsibility among consumers and companies.
What are the limitations and challenges facing Fair Trade certification?
Certification Costs
: The financial burden of obtaining Fair Trade certification can be a significant barrier for small producers. Similarly, transitioning to carbon markets may involve high initial costs for companies to implement the necessary technologies and processes.
Market Accessibility
: Fair Trade products may not have guaranteed market access, mirroring potential challenges in carbon markets where the demand for carbon credits may fluctuate based on regulations and market conditions.
Complex Standards
: Just as Fair Trade certification has varying standards, the guidelines under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement can also lead to confusion about which carbon-reduction activities are eligible for trading.
How can consumers effectively support Fair Trade initiatives?
Support Certified Products
: Consumers can choose Fair Trade products, which, like carbon credits, require a conscious decision to support ethical and sustainable practices.
Educate and Advocate
: Just as consumers can promote Fair Trade awareness, they can also advocate for transparent carbon markets and support policies that foster sustainable practices.
Engagement with Companies
: Consumers can encourage businesses to participate in Fair Trade and carbon markets by demanding accountability and sustainability in their supply chains.
Community Participation
: Involvement in local Fair Trade events can parallel participation in climate action initiatives, such as local carbon offset programs or sustainability projects, thereby supporting both movements.
Utilizing Social Media
: Consumers can leverage social media to share information about Fair Trade and carbon markets, helping to amplify their importance and drive consumer engagement.
Way forward:
Strengthen Certification Accessibility:
Lower the cost and simplify the certification process to make Fair Trade more accessible for small-scale producers, boosting their participation and benefits.
Enhance Consumer Education:
Increase awareness campaigns about the impact of Fair Trade, encouraging more people to support certified products and promoting ethical consumption habits.
