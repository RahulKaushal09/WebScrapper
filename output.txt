Trouble arose with the introduction of the Education Bill. The Catholic Church, overseeing numerous educational institutions, viewed the bill as an encroachment on its authority and opposed it. Local Congress party members seized the opportunity to organize state-wide protests, leading to lathi-charges and firing by the government.3.

In response to Pakistan-sponsored tribal attacks, India, aided by the local population led by Sheikh Abdullah, swiftly took military action. However, before completing the task, Nehru complained with the Security Council in January 1948, leading to a ceasefire on January 1, 1949. Although India initially agreed to hold a plebiscite in 1947 under international supervision, it withdrew from the offer in 1955. Verbal disputes over Kashmir occurred in international forums, but no actual war transpired between the two nations until 1964.Indus River Water Dispute: The equitable distribution of waters from the Indus system became a contentious issue post-partition. India received 5 million out of the 28 million irrigated acres by the Indus. The majority of waters from the western parts of the Indus system flowed into the Arabian Sea. Disputes arose over natural calamities like droughts and floods, with Pakistan blaming India. Under the World Bank's guidance, an interim agreement on canal waters was signed on April 17, 1959. Subsequently, a comprehensive agreement was signed on September 19, 1960, in Karachi.
