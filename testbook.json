style=\"vertical-align: middle;font-size: 21px;\"><u>Key Points</u></span></strong></span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Incidence:</strong> A pattern of consuming less than 0.4 to 0.6g of protein per kg of <strong>body weight per day is considered low protein intake.</strong></li>\n<li>This may occur due to poor diet, certain disorders, or by choice in certain dietary lifestyles.</li>\n<li><strong>Basic Role of Protein:</strong> Protein is one of the fundamental macronutrients essential for a host of biological functions such as <strong>building and repair of body tissues, production of enzymes and hormones, and forming antibodies.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Protein Intake Recommendations: </strong>The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for protein is a minimum of 0.8g per kg of body weight per day for adults.</li>\n<li>However, the needs can vary depending on a <strong>person's age, sex, level of physical activity, and overall health condition.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Effects of Low Protein Intake:</strong> Low protein intake over time may lead to symptoms like <strong>edema, thin and brittle hair, lethargy, skin problems, loss of muscle mass, increased risk of bone fractures, and in severe cases, kwashiorkor, a severe form of malnutrition.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>At-Risk Populations: </strong>Those at risk of low protein intake include the elderly, those with <strong>eating disorders, vegans and vegetarians not adequately balancing their diets, people living in poverty, and people with specific dietary</strong> restrictions due to other health conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Supplementation and Dietary Adjustments:</strong> In case of low protein intake, diet modifications are usually suggested as the <strong>first line of treatment.</strong></li>\n<li>This could include increasing consumption of <strong>high-protein foods and/or using protein supplements.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>High-Protein Foods:</strong> Foods rich in protein include <strong>fish, lean meats, eggs, dairy products, legumes, nuts and seeds. </strong></li>\n<li>There are also good sources of protein in some <strong>grains and vegetables.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring Protein Intake:</strong> Regularly monitoring protein intake can prevent <strong>low protein intake scenarios.</strong></li>\n<li>Food journals, nutritional labels, and in some cases consultation with a <strong>dietitian or nutritionist, can all be useful tools.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Potential Consequences on Long-term Health: </strong>Chronic low protein intake can impact overall health in the long term, causing growth issues in children, challenges in healing and recovering from <strong>wounds or illnesses, decreased immunity, and general weakness or fatigue.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Importance of Balanced Diet:</strong> Beyond just protein, a balanced diet providing <strong>adequate portions of all macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) is crucial for overall health and well-being.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n", "section_name": "Subject Specific"},

feeding, marking a significant step</strong> in an infant's <strong>nutrition and development.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Age of Introduction: </strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) and many pediatric organizations recommend<strong> introducing solids, or beikost, around the age of six months.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Complementary Feeding: </strong>Beikost is also known as complementary feeding.</li>\n<li>The term implies that the food is in addition to breast milk or formula, which should remain the primary source of nutrition for the first year.</li>\n<li><strong>Gradual Process:</strong> Introducing beikost is a gradual process, usually starting with <strong>pureed fruits, vegetables or, sometimes, iron-fortified cereals.</strong></li>\n<li>Over time, more texture and variety can be introduced.</li>\n<li><strong>Importance: </strong>This transition is essential to meet the increasing nutritional needs of the growing child.</li>\n<li><strong>Food Diversity:</strong> Over time, a variety of foods should be introduced to ensure the child gets a balanced diet and gets used to different <strong>food textures and tastes.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Awareness of Allergies:</strong> It's important to watch for potential food allergies, particularly when introducing common allergenic foods like<strong> eggs, nuts, dairy, and seafood.</strong></li>\n<li>These foods should be introduced one at a time to pinpoint any potential allergic reactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Influence on Eating Behavior:</strong> How and when beikost is introduced can influence a child's eating behavior and preferences and has implications for their health in later life.</li>\n<li><strong>Baby-Led Weaning: </strong>Another approach to introducing solid food is baby-led weaning, where babies are encouraged to feed themselves<strong> hand-held foods instead of being spoon-fed </strong><span style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">purees</span><strong>.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Consultation with Professionals: </strong>The introduction of solid foods should be done in consultation with healthcare professionals who

questions:</p>\n<p>The wastage of food is substantial in every country,\u00a0but some studies have shown that it is more serious in developing countries. The UNFAO had estimated that one-third of all produced food may be getting wasted. The world produces twice the amount of food that is needed, but large numbers of people are deprived of it due to wastage and other reasons. Food gets wasted at the farm, when it moves to the market and is processed, stored and shifted to shops and finally in the kitchen. Many fruits and vegetables perish soon after harvesting. There is a need to improve production and storage practices,\u00a0transport infrastructure, cold chain systems and processing techniques. Modern technologies and better packaging methods are needed. But even in countries where these facilities are available, wastage is high. So, the most important requirement is to improve popular awareness of the need to ensure that food is not wasted in any form,\u00a0at any stage. Some countries have launched a clean plate campaign against wastage of food. It is estimated that food worth at least Rs. 1 lakh crore is wasted in India, and this does not include wastage of cooked food. A part of that should be enough to feed the large numbers of hungry people in the country, which is ranked 94 out of 107 countries in the Global Hunger Index. Food is wasted massively at weddings and on other occasions. The UN report says that reducing food waste would also cut green house gas emissions and slow the destruction of nature through land conversion and pollution. Avoiding food wastage should therefore become a national mission. It will have very positive environmental, social and economic impacts. Let us remember that millions of families go hungry every day in many parts of the world. In India. the household food waste estimate is 50 kg per capita per year, which is less than the US and China.
