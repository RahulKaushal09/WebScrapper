"Methods of Sampling Sampling is a technique used in research where a subset of individuals is selected from a larger population to represent the entire population. This section discusses various methods of sampling. Random Sampling Random sampling is a method where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This can be done in several ways: Lottery Method Each member of the population is assigned a number, and numbers are randomly drawn to select the sample. Tables of Random Numbers A table of random numbers is used to randomly select members from the population. Purposeful or Deliberate Sampling This method involves the researcher making deliberate choices about which members of the population to include based on who they believe will provide the best information. Stratified or Mixed Sampling This method involves dividing the population into distinct strata or groups based on certain characteristics. A random sample is then taken from each group. This ensures that different segments of the population are adequately represented. Example: If studying a population with different age groups, the population is divided into age categories, and samples are taken from each category. Systematic Sampling In systematic sampling, items are selected from an ordered list at regular intervals. Example: Every 10th item on a list is selected. Cluster Sampling In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters (groups), and a random sample of clusters is selected. All members of the chosen clusters are then included in the sample. Example: Dividing a city into districts and randomly selecting districts, then surveying all individuals in those districts. Quota Sampling Quota sampling involves dividing the population into groups and then sampling a specific quota from each group, similar to stratified sampling, but without random selection within groups. Convenience Sampling In convenience sampling, the sample is chosen based on ease of access and convenience to the researcher. Example: Surveying individuals who are easily accessible, such as people in a shopping mall. Reliability of Sampling Data The reliability of sampling data depends on several factors: Size of the Sample Larger samples tend to be more representative of the population. Method of Sampling The chosen sampling method impacts the reliability and accuracy of the data. Skills of Correspondents and Enumerators The effectiveness of those collecting the data affects its reliability. Training of Enumerators Proper training ensures that data collection is consistent and accurate. Important Organizations for Data Collection Several national and international organizations collect, process, and publish statistical data. Key organizations include: NSSO (National Sample Survey Organization) Conducts large-scale surveys on socio-economic issues. RBI (Reserve Bank of India) Collects and publishes financial and economic data. Registrar General of India Conducts the Census and collects vital statistics. DGCIS (Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics) Collects trade statistics. Labour Bureau Collects data on labor and employment.",Paraphrase above information in points .

            Purposeful or Deliberate Sampling
        </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Purposeful sampling involves selecting specific individuals based on
        certain criteria deemed important for the study. This is often used when
        specific insights are required. The researcher identifies individuals
        who are thought to have particular knowledge or experience relevant to
        the study.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Example
        </strong>
        : In a study about expert opinions on climate change, researchers might
        only select environmental scientists and policy makers.

            Stratified or Mixed Sampling
        </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct
        sub-groups (strata) and then randomly sampling from each stratum. This
        ensures that all sub-groups are represented.
        <br />
        The population is divided based on characteristics like age, gender,
        income, etc. A random sample is drawn from each stratum.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Example
            </strong>
            : In a survey of a city's population, the city might be divided into
            age groups (e.g., 18-30, 31-50, 51+) and a random sample taken from
            each group to ensure representation across all ages.

            Systematic Sampling
        </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Systematic sampling involves selecting every nth item from a list of the
        population. A starting point is selected at random, and then every nth
        item in the list is chosen.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Example
            </strong>
            : In a list of 1000 names, every 10th person might be selected for a
            survey, starting from a random point in the list.

        <strong>
            Cluster Sampling
        </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and then
        randomly selecting some clusters to include all members from those
        clusters. The population is divided into clusters, which could be
        geographic or organizational units. Clusters are randomly chosen, and
        all members of these clusters are included in the sample.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Example
            </strong>
            : In a national survey, cities (clusters) are randomly selected, and
            all residents within those cities are surveyed.

    </h4>
    <p>
        Quota sampling involves dividing the population into groups and then
        selecting samples from each group to meet a specific quota. This method
        is similar to stratified sampling but does not involve random selection
        within groups. The population is segmented into groups, and samples are
        taken until a pre-set number of individuals from each group are
        included.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Example
            </strong>
            : A survey requires 100 respondents with specific quotas for gender,
            age, and occupation. Once quotas are met, sampling stops.

    </h4>
    <p>
        Convenience sampling involves selecting individuals who are easiest to
        reach or most convenient for the researcher. The sample is chosen based
        on ease of access rather than randomness.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Example

"""What are Common Challenges in Data Collection?
 Data Quality Issues: The main problem affecting the extensive use of machine learning is poor data quality. To make technologies like machine learning work well, you need to focus on ensuring data quality. Inconsistent Data: When dealing with various data sources, there can be differences in the same information, like formats, units, or even spellings. These differences can arise during company mergers or relocations. Inconsistent data, if not dealt with consistently, can lessen the value of the data over time. Organizations that stress data consistency aim to have reliable data to support their analyses. Data Downtime: Data is crucial for the decisions and operations of data-focused businesses. However, there can be short periods when data is not reliable or unavailable. This data unavailability can lead to customer complaints and below-par analytical outcomes. Data engineers spend a lot of time ensuring data pipelines are current and dependable. From data collection to insights, the time taken to process data can be long, incurring high costs. Ambiguous Data: Even with careful oversight, mistakes can still happen in large databases or data lakes, especially with rapidly streaming data. These mistakes can involve unnoticed spelling errors, formatting problems, or misleading column headings. Unclear data can result in various reporting and analytics challenges. Duplicate Data: Streaming data, local databases, and cloud data lakes are some of the data sources that modern businesses have to deal with. They may also have application and system silos. These sources are likely to duplicate and overlap quite a bit. Duplicate contact information, for example, significantly impacts the customer experience. When certain prospects are overlooked while others are contacted repeatedly, marketing campaigns suffer. The chances of biased analytical outcomes rise when there is duplicate data. It can also lead to machine learning models with biased training data. Too Much Data: While we emphasize data-driven analytics and its benefits, there is a data quality issue with too much data. There is a risk of getting lost in a large amount of data when looking for information relevant to your analytical efforts. Data scientists, data analysts, and business users spend 80% of their time searching for and organizing the right data. With an increase in data volume, other data quality problems become more serious, especially when dealing with streaming data and large files or databases. Inaccurate Data: For heavily regulated industries like healthcare, data accuracy is vital. Given the current situation, increasing data quality for situations like COVID-19 and future pandemics is crucial. Inaccurate information doesn't give you an accurate picture of the situation and can't be used to plan the best course of action. Personalized customer experiences and marketing strategies underperform if your customer data is inaccurate. Hidden Data: Most businesses only use a portion of their data, with the rest sometimes lost in data silos or discarded in data graveyards. For example, the customer service team might not receive customer data from sales, missing a chance to build more precise and comprehensive customer profiles. Missing opportunities to develop new products, improve services, and streamline processes are caused by hidden data. Finding Relevant Data: Finding relevant data is not straightforward. There are many factors to consider when trying to find relevant data, such as the relevant domain, demographics, time period, and more. Data that isn't relevant to our study in any of these factors becomes obsolete and we can't effectively proceed with its analysis. This could lead to incomplete research or analysis, repetitive data collection, or the termination of the study. Deciding the Data to Collect: Determining what data to collect is one of the most crucial factors when collecting data and should be among the first considerations. We need to choose the subjects the data will cover, the sources we will use to gather it, and the amount of information we will need. Our answers to these questions will depend on our goals or what we aim to achieve using the data. For example, we may choose to gather information on the types of articles that website visitors between the ages of 20 and 50 access most frequently. We could also opt to gather data on the average age of all customers who made a purchase from your business in the last month. Dealing With Big Data: Big data refers to extremely large data sets with complex and diverse structures. These characteristics often result in increased challenges when storing, analyzing, and utilizing different methods to extract results. Big data particularly refers to data sets that are very large or complex, making traditional data processing tools insufficient. The massive amount of data, both unstructured and structured, that a business encounters on a daily basis. Low Response and Other Research Issues: Poor design and low response rates have been identified as two issues with data collection, especially in health surveys that used questionnaires. This can lead to an inadequate or insufficient supply of data for the study. Establishing an incentivized data collection program could be helpful in increasing responses.""",Paraphrase above information in points . Make sure language you use should be in layman .

            Modern businesses have to manage streaming data, local databases,
            and cloud data lakes. They may also have application and system
            silos, leading to significant duplication and overlap. Duplicate
            contact details, for instance, can greatly impact the customer
            experience.

                Too Much Data:
            </strong>
            While the emphasis is on data-driven analytics and its advantages,
            having too much data can be a data quality issue. There is a risk of
            getting lost in a large volume of data when searching for
            information relevant to analytical efforts.

            <strong>
                Inaccurate Data:
            </strong>
            For heavily regulated sectors like healthcare, data accuracy is
            essential. Improving data quality for situations like COVID-19 and
            future pandemics is crucial. Inaccurate information does not provide
            an accurate representation of the situation and cannot be used to
            plan the best course of action.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Hidden Data:
            </strong>
            Most businesses utilize only a portion of their data, with the
            remainder sometimes lost in data silos or discarded in data
            graveyards. Missing opportunities to develop new products, enhance
            services, and streamline processes are consequences of hidden data.

            <strong>
                Finding Relevant Data:
            </strong>
            Identifying relevant data is not always straightforward. Various
            factors need to be considered when trying to find relevant data,
            such as domain relevance, demographics, and time period. Data that
            is irrelevant in any of these aspects becomes obsolete and hinders
            effective analysis.

            <strong>
                Deciding the Data to Collect:
            </strong>
            Determining what data to collect is a crucial aspect of data
            collection and should be prioritized. Choices regarding the subjects
            covered by the data, data sources, and required information depend
            on the goals or objectives of data usage.

                Dealing With Big Data:
            </strong>
            Big data involves extremely large and complex data sets, posing
            challenges in storage, analysis, and deriving results. Traditional
            data processing tools may not be adequate for handling big data
            effectively.

            data collection, particularly in health surveys using

"""Q3: Examine the linkages between the nineteenth century’s Indian Renaissance and the emergence of national identity. 
Ans: Nineteenth century witnessed significant changes in Indian polity and society consequent to the expansion and consolidation of British imperialism in India which made Indians realise that their interests were sacrificed in order to promote the interests of the British authority. The impact of modern western culture and consciousness of defeat by a foreign power gave birth to a new awakening. The modern educational systems familiarised the educated classes with the ideas of equality, liberty and nationalism. They were impressed by modern science and the doctrines of reason and humanism. Thoughtful Indians who were product of modern education began to look for the strengths and weaknesses of their society aimed at giving back to the nation its lost identity. This new cultural project, which partly manifested itself through the social and religious reforms was encoded in the phrase ‘Indian Renaissance’. It marked a period of transition in values, transformation in social sensibilities and rebirth in cultural creativity. A defining feature of the movement was an inquiry into the past and an assessment of the traditions to overcome contemporary problems. Ram Mohan Roy’s use of Hindu scriptures in his debate with his opponents on Sati, or Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar’s widow remarriage campaign, or Narayana Guru’s advocacy of universalism sought to eliminate social obscurantism, religious superstition and irrational rituals. The common feature that they all shared was the urge to transform the existing social and cultural conditions, ranging from irrational religious practices and rituals to the oppressive state of women’s lives. Renaissance ‘purified’ and ‘rediscovered’ an Indian civilisation that was conformant with the European ideals of rationalism, empiricism, monotheism and individualism. It was meant to show that Indian civilisation was by no means inferior to that of the West, rather in one sense, in its spiritual accomplishments it was even superior to it. Evidence of this search for a superior national culture could be found in the development of patriotic regional literature, in the evolution of new art forms, in the search for purer forms of classical music and in the construction of new ideals of womanhood. The literary movement led by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Tagore, Iqbal and Subramaniya Bharati provided leadership with imagination and fervor. The movement, thus, not only talked of beauty and nationalism but also revealed to its followers India in terms of its spirit, its philosophy, its arts, its poetry, its music and its myriad ways of life. The sense of pride in the spiritual essence of Indian civilisation, as opposed to the material culture of the West, motivated Indians to confront the colonial state in a newly emerging public space. This, in other words, provided the ideological foundation of modern Indian nationalism that developed in the late nineteenth century.""",Paraphrase the above text but don't change the basic sense of the passage and don't make the language complicated.

            Renaissance and the emergence of national identity. (Ancient History
            and Art &amp; Culture)
        </strong>
        <br />
        <strong>
            Ans:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Nineteenth-century Transformations in India:
        </strong>
        The 19th century witnessed profound changes in Indian society and
        politics due to the expansion and consolidation of British imperialism.
        Indians became aware that their interests were being subordinated to
        those of the British authority.
    </p>
    <p>
        The impact of modern Western culture, coupled with the consciousness of
        defeat by a foreign power, sparked a new awakening. Modern education
        systems introduced the educated classes to ideas of equality, liberty,
        and nationalism. The educated Indians, products of modern education,
        started critically evaluating their society, aiming to restore the
        nation's lost identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        This cultural shift, expressed through social and religious reforms, was
        encapsulated in the term 'Indian Renaissance.' It denoted a period of
        transitioning values, evolving social sensibilities, and a resurgence in
        cultural creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        A significant aspect of this movement was the examination of the past
        and an evaluation of traditions to address contemporary challenges.
        Figures like Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Narayana Guru
        aimed to eradicate social obscurantism, religious superstitions, and
        irrational rituals. Their common goal was the transformation of existing
        social and cultural conditions, especially concerning irrational
        religious practices and the plight of women.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Renaissance aimed to 'purify' and 'rediscover' an Indian
        civilization aligned with European ideals of rationalism, empiricism,
        monotheism, and individualism. It sought to demonstrate that Indian
        civilization was not inferior to the West and, in certain spiritual
        aspects, even superior.
    </p>
    <p>
        Evidence of this quest for a superior national culture was evident in
        the rise of patriotic regional literature, the emergence of new art
        forms, the pursuit of purer classical music, and the construction of new
        ideals of womanhood. Literary figures such as Bankim Chandra
        Chattopadhyay, Tagore, Iqbal, and Subramaniya Bharati provided
        leadership with imagination and fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
        The movement not only emphasized beauty and nationalism but also
        presented India in terms of its spirit, philosophy, arts, poetry, music,
        and diverse ways of life. The pride in the spiritual essence of Indian
        civilization, in contrast to the material culture of the West, motivated
        Indians to confront the colonial state in an emerging public space. This
        laid the ideological foundation for modern Indian nationalism in the
        late 19th century.

"""Q4: Many voices had strengthened and enriched the nationalist movement during the Gandhian Phase. Elaborate. 
Ans: Gandhian Phase in Indian freedom struggle is undoubtedly remarkable because of the perspective Gandhiji provided to the masses and the way he guided the freedom fighters with the means of truth and non-violence. But there were numerous other simultaneous factors which further strengthened Gandhi’s efforts and contributed to the nationalist movement. Voices which strengthened and enriched the nationalist movement: Khilafat Movement (1919-22) was launched by the Indian Muslims to pressurise the British government to preserve the authority of Ottoman Sultan as Caliph of Islam. Gandhi and Congress leaders viewed it as an opportunity for cementing Hindu-Muslim unity and bringing the Muslims in the National Movement although this event is said to have brought the issue of religion in the freedom struggle. The ideological differences between the Swarajists and the No-Changers within the congress led to serious changes and contribution. No-changers continued their constructive programme of spinning, temperance, Hindu-Muslim unity, removal of untouchability etc whereas Swarajists won the election of Central Legislative Assembly in november 1923 filling the political void while the national movement was regaining its strength. Marxism and other socialist ideas spread rapidly in 1927 under J.L. Nehru and S.C. Bose’s leadership. The left wing did not confine its concern to freedom struggle only but raised the question of internal class oppression by the capitalists and landlords. It strengthened the voices of the marginalised and poor of the country and connected them to the movements. Revolutionaries like R.P. Bismil, C.S. Azad and Bhagat Singh among others took the responsibilities of informing people about a necessary revolution to uproot British Empire. The Terrorist Movement in Bengal led by Surya Sen is notable because of the role of revolutionary women who participated. Students and peasant parties got involved and propagated Marxist and communist ideas while remaining an integral part of the national movement and the Congress. In 1928, Bardoli Satyagraha occurred under the leadership of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel bringing forward farmers’ concerns. There was rapid growth of trade unionism under the leadership of All India Trade Union Congress and many strikes took place during 1928 like Kharagpur, Jamshedpur and Bombay Textile Mill strike is the most important. The traders and workers contributed to the struggle for independence. Women from all over India were not left alone. They came forward and equally contributed to the national movement. Kasturba Gandhi, VIjay Laxmi Pandit, Aruna Asaf Ali, Bhikaji Cama are some of the most prominent who assumed leadership at different fronts. Even the Business class participated by giving financial assistance and rejecting imported goods Every class, section, age group, political ideology emerged, came forward and contributed to the national movement. Even though it weakened the movement to some extent by the fragmentation and the internal ideological differences, it mainly made the movement strong by diversifying it and adding alternative perspectives to it. This multidimensional nature of the movement is one of the reasons for its success in 1947 when finally all the unheard voices till then were heard.""",Paraphrase the above text but don't change the basic sense of the passage and don't make the language complicated.

        The Gandhian Phase in the Indian freedom struggle is undeniably
        noteworthy due to Gandhiji's unique perspective and guidance,
        emphasizing truth and non-violence in the pursuit of freedom. However,
        several concurrent factors played a crucial role in reinforcing Gandhi’s
        efforts and contributing to the nationalist movement.

                Khilafat Movement (1919-22):
            </strong>
            Launched by Indian Muslims to pressure the British government to
            preserve the authority of the Ottoman Sultan as the Caliph of Islam.
            Gandhi and Congress leaders saw it as an opportunity to foster
            Hindu-Muslim unity, despite introducing religious considerations
            into the freedom struggle.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Ideological Differences within Congress:
            </strong>
            The ideological rift between the Swarajists and No-Changers within
            Congress brought about significant contributions. No-changers
            focused on constructive programs like spinning, temperance,
            Hindu-Muslim unity, and untouchability removal. Meanwhile,
            Swarajists won the 1923 Central Legislative Assembly elections,
            filling a political void during the national movement's resurgence.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Spread of Marxist and Socialist Ideas:
            </strong>
            Under the leadership of J.L. Nehru and S.C. Bose in 1927, Marxism
            and socialist ideas addressed issues beyond the freedom struggle,
            emphasizing internal class oppression by capitalists and landlords.
            This strengthened the voices of the marginalized and poor,
            connecting them to broader movements.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Role of Revolutionaries:
            </strong>
            Figures like R.P. Bismil, C.S. Azad, and Bhagat Singh played crucial
            roles in advocating for a necessary revolution to uproot the British
            Empire. Surya Sen's Terrorist Movement in Bengal, particularly
            notable for the participation of revolutionary women, was part of
            this wave.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Trade Unionism and Strikes:
            </strong>
            The rapid growth of trade unionism, particularly under the All India
            Trade Union Congress, led to various strikes in 1928, such as
            Kharagpur, Jamshedpur, and the Bombay Textile Mill strike, making
            significant contributions to the independence struggle.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Women's Participation:
            </strong>
            Women from across India, including Kasturba Gandhi, Vijay Laxmi
            Pandit, Aruna Asaf Ali, and Bhikaji Cama, emerged as prominent
            leaders in different facets of the national movement.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Business Class Participation:
            </strong>
            Even the business class participated by providing financial
            assistance and rejecting imported goods, demonstrating a diverse and
            united front.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While internal ideological differences and fragmentation weakened the
        movement to some extent, the multidimensional nature of the
        contributions made it strong by diversifying perspectives. This
        diversity ultimately contributed to the success of the movement in 1947,
        where previously unheard voices played a crucial role.

"""Q5: Assess the role of British imperial power in complicating the process of transfer of power during the 1940s.
Ans:Introduction Britain never wanted to leave India but the promise to the Indian National Congress of independence in return of Indian resources and army during World War Two; the post war financial and political exhaustion; change in political power at the centre (Labour Party) whose ideology favoured the Congress party; increasing global pressure and the inability to crush Indian leaders’ will and efforts finally led to the Indian independence. However, Britain did succeed in making the process of transfer of power so complicated and hard that India still suffers from them. Cabinet Mission Sir Stafford Cripps was responsible for drafting the Cabinet Mission Plan, which proposed a complicated system for India with three tiers- the provinces, provincial groupings and the centre. The centre’s power was confined to foreign affairs, defence, currency and communication only. Three major groups of provinces: Group A, to include the Hindu-majority provinces; Group B, containing the Muslim-majority provinces (western Pakistan); and Group C, to include the Muslim-majority Bengal (eastern Pakistan). Even though both Nehru and Jinnah eventually refused to accept it, Lord Wavell authorised a cabinet with Nehru as the Interim Prime Minister which enraged Jinnah who in turn resorted to direct action of sparking riots and massacres. Partition In July, 1947 the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act which provided for the demarcation of India and Pakistan by midnight of August 14–15, 1947, in just one month. Two Nations Theory was an important factor here and fuelled communalism. The task of demarcating the boundaries was given to a British lawyer, Sir Cyril Radcliffe who had never visited the country before and was clueless about the social and political consequences of his decision. Two boundary commissions were set up for it. During partition, there was a large-scale communal violence and forced migration of people, probably the biggest in history. Autonomy to Princely States The British paramountcy on the princely states and all the existing treaties of Britain with the princely states before the independence ended in 1947. As princely states were not a part of the British India, they became independent and had the option to either merge with India or with Pakistan or to stay independent. Even after the efforts of Lord Mountbatten, Nehru and Patel, few princely states like Kashmir, Junagadh and Hyderabad posed some serious challenges in the already troubled times. Conclusion It was hard to let go of the main resource supplier and the market consumer but when the odds were not in favour of Britain, it gave independence to India but made sure to create some contentious issues while leaving India. A lot of current day problems like issue of enclaves with Bangladesh (later resolved through The Constitution 100th Amendment Act, 2015), the migration issue, Kashmir issue between India-Pakistan etc. have their roots in the complications created by the British imperial power during the 1940s.""",Paraphrase the above text but don't change the basic sense of the passage and don't make the language complicated.

        <br />
        Sir Stafford Cripps drafted the Cabinet Mission Plan, proposing a
        complex system for India with three tiers: provinces, provincial
        groupings, and the center. The center's authority was limited to foreign
        affairs, defense, currency, and communication. Three major province
        groups were outlined, but both Nehru and Jinnah rejected the plan. Lord
        Wavell authorized an interim government with Nehru as Prime Minister,
        further straining relations with Jinnah, who resorted to direct action.

            Partition:
            <br />
        </strong>
        In July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act,
        calling for the demarcation of India and Pakistan by August 14–15, 1947,
        within just one month. The Two Nations Theory fueled communalism,
        leading to large-scale violence and forced migration during partition.
        Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a British lawyer unfamiliar with India, was tasked
        with demarcating boundaries, contributing to the historical communal
        strife.

            Autonomy to Princely States:
            <br />
        </strong>
        British paramountcy over princely states ended in 1947, and existing
        treaties concluded. Princely states gained independence, with the option
        to merge with India, Pakistan, or remain independent. Despite efforts by
        Lord Mountbatten, Nehru, and Patel, princely states like Kashmir,
        Junagadh, and Hyderabad presented significant challenges during this
        turbulent period.

            Conclusion:
            <br />
        </strong>
        Despite Britain's reluctance to let go of a major resource supplier and
        market consumer, the odds forced it to grant independence to India.
        However, the British legacy left behind contentious issues, leading to
        present-day problems such as the enclave issue with Bangladesh,
        migration concerns, and the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan,
        all rooted in the complexities created during the 1940s.

    </p>
    <p>
        When did the entire Indian Subcontinent get a name? This is a tricky
        question because ancient texts are hard to date. However, in the
        Mahabharata, we come across the terms
        <strong>
            'Bhäratavarsha' and 'Jambudvipa.'
        </strong>
        Scholars believe that this poem was written a few centuries before the
        Common Era (BCE).

            <strong>
                Bhäratavarsha
            </strong>
            : This term refers to the entire Subcontinent. It means 'the country
            of the Bharatas.' The name 'Bharata' first appears in the Rig Veda
            and refers to one of the main Vedic groups of people. Later
            literature mentions several kings named Bharata.

            <strong>
                Jambudvipa
            </strong>
            : This term means 'the island of the jamun tree fruit.' The jamun
            tree, also called the jambul tree or Malabar plum tree, is native to
            India. Over time, 'Jambudvipa' came to represent the Indian
            Subcontinent.

            A big clue about the use of 'Jambudvipa' comes from Emperor Ashoka,

"How Foreigners Named India
The first foreigners to mention India were the Persians,
the ancient inhabitants of Iran. In the 6th century BCE, a
Persian emperor launched a military campaign and gained
control of the region of the Indus River, which, as we saw,
was earlier called 'Sindhu'. So, it is no surprise that in their
earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred
to India as 'Hind', 'Hidu' or 'Hindu', which are adaptations
in their language of 'Sindhu'. (Note that in ancient Persian,
'Hindu' is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here
to the Hindu religion.)
Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named
the region 'Indoi' or 'Indike'. They dropped the initial letter
'h' of 'Hindu' because this letter did not exist in their Greek
language.
The ancient Chinese also interacted with India. In several
texts, they refer to India as 'Yintu' or 'Yindu'. This word also
originally comes from 'Sindhu', in the following manner:
Another Chinese word, also derived from
'Sindhu', was 'Tianzhu'; but this word could
also be understood as 'heavenly master'. This
reflects the respect the ancient Chinese had
for India as the land of the Buddha.
You are probably quite familiar with a
more recent term, 'Hindustan', but you may
not know that it was first used in a Persian
inscription some 1,800 years ago! Later on, this became
the term used by most invaders of India to describe the
Indian Subcontinent.",Paraphrase with heading and sub headings,"<h2>

 Can you identify which calendar is most widely used around the world today?
 Yes, the Gregorian calendar is the most widely used around the world today. It is commonly used for
 civil purposes, while other calendars, such as the Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, and Chinese calendars, are
 often used for religious festivals and special occasions.
 Each society and culture has had its own ways ofmeasuring
 time. Major events, such as the birth of an important
 person or the start of a ruler's reign, have often marked
 the beginning of a new era. At present, the Gregorian calendar is commonly used worldwide; side by side, Hindu,
 Muslim, Jewish, Chinese and other calendars are also used
 for calculating the dates of festivals and other auspicious
 events.
 In the West, the conventional year for Jesus Christ's birth
 has generally been taken to be the starting point for this
 calendar. Years are counted forward from this point and
 used to be marked with 'AD' (an abbreviation for a Latin
 phrase that refers to the years after Jesus' birth). However,
 this is now called the Common Era or CE across the world.
 For example, 1947, the year India gained independence,
 can be written as 1947 AD (sometimes AD 1947) or 1947 CE.
 Similarly, the years before the conventional date for the
 birth of Jesus are counted backward and used to be
 marked with BC (or Before Christ). They are now called
 Before Common Era or BCE. For example, 560 BCE is an
 approximate year of birth of Gautama Buddha.",Paraphrase in very simple language according to class 6 students.,"<h2>

"The Beginnings of Human History
 Can you name one way early humans made their lives easier?
 Yes, early humans made their lives easier by using tools like stone axes and arrowheads, which
 helped them hunt, build, and protect themselves.
 Modern humans (Homo sapiens) have walked the planet
 for about 300,000 (three lakh) years. This appears to be a
 very long time, yet it is only a tiny fraction of the Earth's
 history. Let us have a quick look at our early history.
 Early humans faced many challenges from nature and lived
 in bands or groups to help each other. They were constantly
 seeking shelter and food, and were mainly hunters and
 gatherers; this means that they relied on hunting and
 collecting edible plants and fruits for their survival. Our
 early ancestors also had certain beliefs about the natural
 elements and possibly also some notion of afterlife.
 These groups lived in temporary camps, rock shelters or
 caves, and communicated with each other using languages
 that are now lost. They used fire and started making obj ects
 that made their lives easier, like improved stone axes and
 blades, arrowheads and other tools. Aspects of their life
 are visible in rock paintings found in hundreds of caves
 all over the world. Some of those paintings depict simple
 figures or a few symbols; others are more detailed and
 represent scenes with animals or humans. In time, these
 early humans learned to make simple ornaments such as
 stone or shell beads, pendants made of animal teeth, and
 sometimes exchanged them with other groups.",Paraphrase in very simple language according to class 6 students.,"<h2>

"Ada tations of plants and animals living in different habitats
Let us discuss the adaptations of plants and animals living in different habitats.
Terrestrial habitats
Habitats located on the land are called terrestrial habitats. Sandy deserts, mountain regions,
grasslands and forests are some examples of terrestrial habitats.
Sandy deserts
A sandy desert is a very vast area of
land covered with sand. It becomes
hot during the day and cold at
night. It is a windy place. A desert
receives very little rain and has very
little water. Dew drops that form
during the cool nights provide
water to plants and animals living
in the desert.
Plant life: Plants which grow in hot weather with very little water and sandy soil can grow in a
sandy desert. Many kinds of thorny plants, which are known as xerophytes, grow in hot sandy
deserts. Some types of grasses, aloe, living stone plants and
many kinds of cacti are adapted to grow in sandy deserts.
Let us learn about the adaptations of plants that grow
in deserts.
Rain is scarce in a sandy desert. Roots ofdesert plants,
therefore, grow close to the surface and extend over a
large area to absorb as much water as possible.
The plants mostly have small leaves to prcvcnt the loss of water through transpiration.
In most cacti, leaves are reduced to spines or thorns.
The stem of the cactus plant is green and in the absence of leaves, makes food for the plant.
Moreover, the stem stores water when it rains.
Food is scarce in a desert. To prevent animals from eating the entire plant, desert plants have
spines such as those in the cactus.
Animal life: Animals, such
as camels, mice, desert hares,
kangaroo rats, desert foxes,
lizards and snakes, live in hot
sandy deserts. Many kinds of
insects and birds are also found
in deserts.
All these animals are adapted
to live in hot conditions with
very little water. Some animals,
such as the kangaroo rats, can
live without drinking water.
They obtain water from the food
they eat, mostly plants and seeds.
Most desert animals remain in
the shade or in burrows during
the daytime to escape heat.
They become
active
in
the evening or at night
when the temperature drops.
The following description about
the camel tells us how well some
animals are adapted to live in
a desert.
Food and water are scarce in a
desert. Camels can live without
food and water for several days.
However, when water is available,
the camel drinks plenty of water.
al o eats a lot of food when it is available. The excess amount of food after being digested gets
converted into fat. The fat is stored in the hump of the camel. When food is scarce, the fat breaks
down to provide energy to the camel.
The camel has several other features that help it live in a sandy desert. The long legs of the camel
keep its body away from the warm sand. Its toes are joined together to prevent sinking into the
sand. With its large padded feet, the camel is able to walk very briskly on fine sand.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information.," <h2>

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Habitats found on land are called terrestrial habitats. Examples include
        sandy deserts, mountain regions, grasslands, and forests.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Sandy Deserts
        </strong>
        <br />
        A sandy desert is a vast expanse of land covered with sand. It
        experiences extreme temperatures, becoming hot during the day and cold
        at night. Deserts are windy places that receive minimal rainfall and
        have limited water resources. Dew that forms during the cool nights
        provides a crucial source of water for the plants and animals living
        there.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Plant Life:
        </strong>
        Plants that thrive in hot, arid conditions with minimal water and sandy
        soil are well-suited to sandy deserts. Many thorny plants, known as
        xerophytes, are adapted to grow in these harsh conditions. Examples
        include various types of cacti, grasses, aloe, and living stone plants.
        <br />
        <strong>
            Let's examine how desert plants adapt to their environment:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Scarcity of Rain:
            </strong>
            In sandy deserts, rain is rare. As a result, the roots of desert
            plants tend to grow close to the surface and spread over a large
            area to absorb as much water as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Small Leaves:
            </strong>
            Most desert plants have small leaves to reduce water loss through
            transpiration.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Spines or Thorns:
            </strong>
            In many cacti, the leaves have evolved into spines or thorns. The
            green stem of the cactus carries out photosynthesis and stores water
            when it rains.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Protection from Grazing:
            </strong>
            To prevent being completely eaten by animals, desert plants have
            spines, such as those found on cacti.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Animal Life:
        </strong>
        Desert animals, such as camels, mice, desert hares, kangaroo rats,
        desert foxes, lizards, and snakes, are adapted to survive in hot
        conditions with very little water. Insects and birds are also common in
        deserts.
        <br />
        <strong>
            These animals exhibit various adaptations to desert life:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Water Conservation:
            </strong>
            Some animals, like kangaroo rats, can survive without drinking
            water. They extract moisture from the food they eat, mainly plants
            and seeds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Avoiding Heat:
            </strong>
            Many desert animals avoid the daytime heat by staying in the shade
            or burrowing underground. They become active in the evening or at
            night when temperatures drop.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            The Camel
        </strong>
        <br />
        The camel is an excellent example of an animal highly adapted to desert
        life.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Food and Water Scarcity:
            </strong>
            Camels can survive for days without food and water. When water is
            available, they drink large quantities, and when food is abundant,
            they eat a lot. The excess food is converted into fat and stored in
            the camel's hump. This stored fat can be broken down into energy
            when food is scarce.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Physical Adaptations:
            </strong>
            Camels have long legs that keep their bodies away from the hot sand.
            Their toes are joined together to prevent sinking into the sand, and
            their large padded feet enable them to walk quickly on fine sand.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These adaptations enable both plants and animals to survive and thrive
        in the challenging environment of sandy deserts.
    </p>"
"Mountain regions
In the mountainous regions, as the altitude increases, the temperature decreases. That is why the
weather in the mountain regions changes with change in altitude. The lower regions are warmer,
whereas higher altitudes are cold. Such differences in the environment affect both plants and
animals in the mountainous regions.
Plant life: The warmer, lower regions of the Himalayas have dense forests of bamboo and trees,
such as oak and chestnut. The plants growing here are adapted to grow in warmer conditions of
the Himalayas.
As the altitude increases,
the temperature drops and
the land gets covered with
coniferous forests.
Coniferous (cone-bearing)
and evergreen trees such as
firs, pines and cedars mostly
grow here. These trees are
adapted to grow in cold
conditions. The pointed and
triangular shapes of these trees
helps them shed heavy snow.
At about 4000 metres, the weather conditions become very cold and so the vegetation changes
once again. Only plants, such as the juniper trees, that are adapted to extremely cold and moist
conditions, grow at such heights.
Animal life: The numbers and kinds of animals found on the mountains also vary with altitude.
Many kinds of animals live at warmer, lower altitudes.
Animals that live in the mountains have thick fur coats to keep them warm. The higher regions of
mountains have less air. The animals living there generally have more red blood cells to help them
get enough oxygen from the thin air at high altitudes.
Very few plants grow at cold higher altittldcs and, thcrcforc, less food is available for animals,
Only a few insects, spiders and ice worms live on the snow-capped peaks of mountains.
Adaptations of sorne of the animals that live in the mountainous Himalayan habitat are as follows.
Tropical rainforests
Rainforests are found close to the equator, which is why these forests have warm and wet weather
all round the year.
Plant life: The trees that grow
in tropical rainforests never
completely shed their leaves.
Tall trees grow very close to
each other. Broad leaves and
overlapping branches form a thick
umbrella-like roof called canopy.
The canopy blocks nearly all the
sunlight from reaching the forest
floor of the tropical rainforest.
As a result, ferns, some varieties of
palm and other shade-loving plants grow on the wet forest floor. Lichens, orchids and vines grow
on the trees.
Animal life: Brightly coloured butterflies, tnoths, tnosquitocs, tcrmitcs, ants and many kinds
of bees and spiders live in tropical rainforests. Antcatcrs and tapirs live on the ground, whereas
leopards, chitupanzecs, gorillas and a variety of snakes altcrnatc bctwccn the ground and the trees.
Eagles, toucans, parrots, red-cycd frogs, squirrels, many kinds of monkeys, gibbons, orang-utans,
sloths, bats and a variety of snakes live on the trees.
Grasslands
Grasslands have rain during the monsoon, while the rcst of the months are dry and hot.
Plant life: A grassland is a vast, open
region covered with a thick growth of
several kinds of grasses and a few trees.
Animal life: A grassland supports a
rich variety of insects, birds, snakes,
lizards and many types of mammals.
Animals of the grasslands are adapted
to travel great distances in search of
water in the dry season.
Large herbivores, such as the wildebeests, deer, bisons, giraffes and z,ebras, have strong grinding teeth
for eating tough grasses. They have long legs and sharp hooves to run swiftly away from
Their body colour and sharp senses also help them escape from their predators.
Carnivores, such as lions, wild cats, cheetahs, hyenas and wild dogs, are found in grasslands.
They have strong legs with sharp claws, strong and sharp teeth and sharp eyesight. These features
help them catch their prey.
Aquatic habitats
Aquatic regions are bodies of freshwater or saltwater. Freshwater habitats include ponds, lakes,
rivers and wetlands. Mangrove swamps, coral reefs, seas and oceans are saltwater habitats.
Ponds, lakes and rivers
Plant life: Plants,
known as
hydrophytes, grow in freshwater
bodies, such as ponds, lakes and rivers.
Hydrophytes have adaptations that
help them grow in water.
Some plants, such as Hydrilla, grow
completely under the surface of
water. These plants need less sunlight.
Some plants, such as lotus and water
hyacinth, grow partly in water and
partly above water. Some aquatic
plants, such as the duckweed (the smallest known flowering plant) float freely on the water surface
because they need plenty of sunlight.
Aquatic plants have air spaces in their stems and Icavcs. These air spaces help them stand erect
or stay afloat. The large, flat, floating leaves of aquatic plants collect enough sunlight. The leaves
have a waxy coating to make them waterproof. Submerged plants have narrow ribbon-like leaves,
which can easily bend with flowing water. In some submerged plants, leaves are divided, which
allows water to flow past without causing any damage to them.
Animal life: Freshwater fish, crabs, prawns, frogs, turtles and crocodiles live in ponds, lakes and
rivers. Salamanders live in wet places.
Frogs are adapted to live on land as well as in water. They breathe in air directly from the
atmosphere when on land, and when in water, they obtain oxygen from the water through their
moist skin.
Many kinds of birds are found near streams, ponds, lakes and rivers. They obtain food from the
waterbodies. Such birds are called water birds. Many of these birds have webbed feet that help them
swim. Their beaks are adapted to feed on aquatic organisms, such as algae, snails, insects and fish.
Mangrove swamps
Mangrove swamps are situated close to the
tropical seas. They remain covered with shallow
sea water. The soil is silty and covered with salty
water. Mangroves reduce the force of ocean waves.
They can save lives and property during natural
disasters, such as cyclones and tsunamis.
Plant life: Mangrove swamps have a dense growth
of mangrove plants. These plants have stilt roots
that grow upwards and their tips remain above the
surface of water. These roots take in air directly from
the atmosphere.
Animal life: Mangrove swamps are the habitat of
many kinds of marine organisms. Many types of fish
mangroves
and other marine animals use mangrove swamps as feeding and breeding grounds.
Oceans
The oceans cover three-fourths of the Earth's surface. They are located in different parts of the
Earth and have different environments. The oceans in the tropical regions have warm water and
those closer to the poles have ice-cold water.
The oceans are dominated with a variety of fish. Sharks, tunas, sardines and mackerels are some
such fish. A streamlined body and the fins enable them to swim. The gills help them in absorbing
oxygen from water and the scales protect their bodies. Many kinds of sea birds live on the seashores
and in the sea. Seagulls, penguins, terns, puffins, plovers and pelicans are some such birds.
Whales, seals and dolphins are tuatntnals
adapted to live in oceans. They have flippers
and streatnlined bodies that enable thctn
to switn. Blubber, a thick layer of fat, keeps
their bodies warm and afloat in water.
Although they live in oceans, they directly
breathe oxygen frotn air. Sea snakes and sea
turtles are reptiles that live in the oceans.
Some ocean animals, such as corals,
sea anemones and crabs, live in
the low-tide regions of the sea.
They are adapted to live in shallow
water exposed to direct air and
sunlight. Unlike fish, these sea
animals can stay alive when not
fully submerged in water.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information.,"<p>

            Mountain Regions
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In mountainous areas, temperature decreases as altitude increases. This
        causes the weather in mountain regions to change with elevation. The
        lower regions are warmer, while higher altitudes are colder. These
        environmental differences significantly affect the plants and animals
        living in these regions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Plant Life:
        </strong>
        In the warmer, lower regions of the Himalayas, dense forests of bamboo,
        oak, and chestnut trees thrive. These plants are adapted to the warmer
        conditions found at these altitudes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            As the altitude increases, the temperature drops, and the landscape
            becomes covered with coniferous forests. Trees like firs, pines, and
            cedars, which are cone-bearing and evergreen, dominate these higher
            regions. These trees are adapted to cold conditions. Their pointed
            and triangular shapes help them shed heavy snow.
        </li>
        <li>
            At around 4,000 meters, the weather becomes extremely cold, causing
            another change in vegetation. Only plants like juniper trees, which
            are adapted to extremely cold and moist conditions, can survive at
            such heights.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Animal Life:
        </strong>
        The number and types of animals found in mountain regions also vary with
        altitude. Many animals live at the warmer, lower altitudes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Animals in the mountains often have thick fur coats to keep them
            warm. At higher altitudes, where the air is thinner, animals
            typically have more red blood cells to help them obtain sufficient
            oxygen.
        </li>
        <li>
            Due to the scarcity of plants at colder, higher altitudes, there is
            less food available for animals. Only a few insects, spiders, and
            ice worms can survive on the snow-covered peaks of mountains.

    <p>
        Tropical rainforests are located close to the equator, where the climate
        is warm and wet throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Plant Life:
        </strong>
        In tropical rainforests, trees never fully shed their leaves. Tall trees
        grow very close together, with broad leaves and overlapping branches
        that form a thick, umbrella-like canopy. This canopy blocks nearly all
        sunlight from reaching the forest floor.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            As a result, only shade-loving plants like ferns, some varieties of
            palm, and other plants can grow on the wet forest floor. Lichens,
            orchids, and vines often grow on the trees.

    <p>
        <strong>
            Animal Life:

        A wide variety of animals inhabit tropical rainforests. Brightly colored
        butterflies, moths, mosquitoes, termites, ants, and many types of bees
        and spiders are common. Anteaters and tapirs live on the ground, while
        animals like leopards, chimpanzees, gorillas, and various snakes
        alternate between the ground and the trees.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Large herbivores like wildebeests, deer, bison, giraffes, and zebras
            have strong grinding teeth for eating tough grasses. They have long
            legs and sharp hooves, which allow them to run swiftly away from
            predators. Their body color and sharp senses also help them escape
            from threats.

        <li>
            Carnivores such as lions, wild cats, cheetahs, hyenas, and wild dogs
            are also found in grasslands. They have strong legs with sharp
            claws, strong and sharp teeth, and excellent eyesight, all of which

    <ul>
        <li>
            Some plants, like Hydrilla, grow completely underwater and require
            less sunlight. Others, like lotus and water hyacinth, grow partly in
            water and partly above the water's surface. Aquatic plants like
            duckweed, the smallest known flowering plant, float freely on the
            water's surface because they need ample sunlight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Aquatic plants have air spaces in their stems and leaves, which help
            them stay erect or afloat. Their large, flat, floating leaves gather
            enough sunlight, and the waxy coating on the leaves makes them
            waterproof. Submerged plants often have narrow, ribbon-like leaves
            that can easily bend with the water's flow. In some cases, the
            leaves are divided, allowing water to pass through without causing

"Characteristics of Living things
The rich variety of life on the Earth includes plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms.
No matter where they live and how different they are, all living things have certain
common characteristics.
Growth
Increase in height or length is an indicator of growth of a living
organism. All animals grow when young and stop growing after a
certain age. Plants grow throughout their lives.
Food and water
Living things grow.
plant—autotroph
All kinds of living things need food. Autotrophs are living organisms that
make their own food. Most plants are autotrophs. They make their own
food through the process called photosynthesis. Some microorganisms
are also autotrophs. However, a few plants such as the Cuscuta, do not
make their food or absorb water frotn the soil. They depend on other plants for food and water.
Such plants are called total parasites. They are not autotrophs.
Heterotrophs are living things that depend on other living
things for food. All kinds of animals arc heterotrophs.
Water is a necessity of all kinds of
living things. All kinds of plants
and animals obtain water from
their surroundings.
Movement
'444-3.&;,-,».
animals—heterotrophs
Most animals move from one place to another. Plants do not move from one place to another, but
move their body parts.
For example, shoots of plants move towards light. Some plants close their leaves when the sun sets
and open them when the sun rises.
Respiration
Living things use energy to perform all their activities. They obtain energy from their digested
food through a process called respiration. Respiration includes breathing and release of energy.
In most living things, respiration utilises oxygen to release energy. The needed amount of oxygen
is obtained through breathing. Breathing also involves removal of carbon dioxide from the body.
Plants take in air through stomata. Human beings, all other land-dwelling animals and some aquatic
animals, such as turtles, sea snakes, whales and dolphins, breathe in air. They use oxygen from the air
for respiration. Fish and most other aquatic animals take in oxygen dissolved in water. Turtles and
sea snakes live in water but they breathe in air like land animals.
Response to stimuli
All living things respond to stimulus. Anything that causes a
reaction in a living thing is a stimulus. Sunlight, for example, is a
stimulus that makes shoots of plants move towards it.
Certain sounds would stimulate a grazing deer to become alert and
ultimately run away. The smell of certain foods often stimulates
our appetite.
Excretion
All living things respond
to stimuli.
All living things give out waste products. The process by which waste products are removed from the
body of an organism is called excretion. In animals, the waste products are removed from the body
by excretory organs, such as the kidneys in human beings.
Reproduction
All kinds of plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms
produce young ones like themselves. Many kinds of
animals lay eggs flom which the young ones hatch out.
Mammals give birth to young ones and the mothcr
feeds the babies with her milk. Human beings belong
to this group of animals.
There are mainly two types of plants, flowering
plants and non-flowering plants. Flowering plants
produce flowers, which develop into fruits with seeds.
The mature seeds give rise to new plants—seedlings.
All living things reproduce.
A seed needs warmth, water and air to germinate and form a seedling. A seedling grows into a
healthy plant if it gets the necessary amount of air, water, sunlight, warmth and fertile soil.
All plants do not produce flowers. Pine trees, ferns and mosses
spores in ferns
are such plants, they are
non-flowering plants.
Pine trees produce cones
which have seeds. These seeds
produce new plants.
Ferns and moss plants
produce tiny structures
called spores which give rise
to new plants.
pine cones
Lifespan
All living things have a lifespan, at the end
of which they die. Some organisms, such as
the mayfly insects, live only for a few days,
whereas some tortoises live for more than
a hundred years. Most trees live for many
years, whereas herbs live for a few months.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information.,"<h2>

            Reproduction is the process by which living organisms produce

            methods of reproduction. Many animals lay eggs, from which their

            and the mother feeds her babies with milk.

            </strong>
            plants. Flowering plants produce flowers that develop into fruits
            containing seeds. These seeds, when provided with the right
            conditions—such as warmth, water, and air—germinate and grow into
            new plants.

"Types of motions
Translatory motion
An object is said to be moving in translatory motion if the position of the object changes with
respect to a stationary point or a stationary object. This motion may be along a straight line or
along a curved path and hence, can be classified as rectilinear motion or circular motion.
Rectilinear motion
When an object moves along a straight path, the motion is
called rectilinear motion. Sprinters in a 100-metrc race run
on a straight track in a rectilinear motion. Vehicles that movc
along a straight road move in a similar motion. The flight of
a passenger plane is mostly rectilinear.
Circular motion
When a body moves on a circular path, it
is in circular motion. The motion of the
blades of an electric fan and the hands of
a clock are examples of objects in circular
motion. Circular motion occurs around a
fixed point.
Rotational motion
An object is said to possess rotational motion if it whirls around a fixed axis. In case of
rotational motion, the body remains near the axis of rotation and periodically returns to
its original position.
Another feature of this motion is that different
parts of the objects cover different distances in
the same period of time.
Points A and B on the FMth will cover circular
paths in 24 hours.

The motion of the Earth about its imaginary
axis or that of a top spinning are examples of
rotational motion.
Periodic motion
Motion that repeats itself in a fixed
time interval is called periodic motion.
The hands of a clock have a periodic
motion. The hour hand completes a circle
peri
in every 12 hours and the minute hand completes a circle in 60 minutes.
The motions of the Earth are periodic motions. The Earth takes 365 days and 6 hours to complete
one revolution around the sun. The rotational motion of the Earth is also a periodic one.
Oscillatory motion
When an object moves to-and-fro between any two points, it is said to be oscillating. Such a motion
is known as oscillatory motion.
The movement of the pendulum of a clock is an example of
oscillatory motion. In this
kind Of motion, one
end of the pendulum
is at rest. The motion
of thc pcndulum is also
periodic. It completes one
oscillation (A—B—C—B—A)
in a fixed time.
Vibratory motion

When you pluck a string which is
tightly held between two points as in
a musical string instrument, such as a
sitar or a guitar, the string vibrates. Such
a motion is called vibratory motion.

            rectilinear motion. Examples include sprinters running on a straight
            track in a 100-meter race, vehicles traveling along a straight road,
            and the mostly straight flight of a passenger plane.

Light makes things visible. Unless an object reflects the light falling on it, we are not able to see
it. The objects which we are able to see can be placed into one of the two categories—luminous
objects or illuminated objects.


Luminous objects
A luminous object produces light of its own. It is a source of light. The sun and a lighted candle
are examples of luminous objects.
Sources of light
A source of light can be natural or human-made.
The sun and all other stars are natural luminous
objects. They are natural sources of light. Electric bulbs,
candles, lanterns and torches are
also sources of light but these are
human-made.
Fireflies, certain bacteria and fungi and many kinds of deep-water fish
produce light without heat. The process through which living things
produce light is known as bioluminescence.


Illuminated objects
An illutninatcd object docs not produce light. It appears bright becausc light falls on it.
Illuminated objects arc also called non-ltltninous objects.
The Earth is illuminated by the light from the sun. The illuminated
part experiences day and the part ofthe Earth that does not receive
sunlight experiences night. Illuminated objects reflect light that
falls on them, that is why they appear bright.
This page too is illuminated by light. You are able to read this page
because the light falling on it reflects back and reaches your eyes.

            What is a Light Year?
        </strong>
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A light year is a unit of distance that astronomers use to measure
            the vast distances in space. Since light travels at an incredible
            speed of approximately 300,000 kilometers per second, the distance
            it covers in one year is enormous.
        </li>
        <li>
            To calculate this, scientists consider the time it takes for light
            emitted by a star to reach Earth. By measuring this time, they can
            determine how far away the star is from our planet. The distance
            covered by light in one year is referred to as one light year.
        </li>
        <li>
            To give you an idea of how far light can travel in a year, let's
            first understand how many seconds are in a year:
        </li>
        <li>
            There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in
            a day, and about 365 days in a year (not accounting for leap years).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                So, the number of seconds in one year is:
            </strong>
            60 × 60 × 24 × 365 = 31,536,000 seconds
        </li>
        <li>
            Therefore, in one light year, light travels approximately 9.46
            trillion kilometers (about 5.88 trillion miles). This immense
            distance helps scientists measure how far away stars and other
            celestial objects are from Earth.

"Objects and their shadows
An object which does not let light pass through it
is called an opaque object. We cannot see through
an opaque object because it does not let any light
pass through it. Wood, stones and metals are
opaque objects.
Some objects allow some amount of light to
pass through them. Such objects are called
translucent objects. As only some of the
light passes through a translucent object, we
are not able to see things placed behind it
clearly. Certain types of glasses and plastics are
translucent materials.
Objects made up of clear glass and some
types of plastic allow light to pass through
them completely. Such objects are said to be
transparent objects. As most of the light passes
through a transparent object, we are able to
clearly see things placed behind it. Clean water
is transparent.
When is a shadow formed?
When an opaque object comes in the path of light, it blocks the
light. As no light passes through the object, a dark patch is seen on
the other side. This dark patch is the shadow of the opaque object.
A clear shadow is formed only when bright light falls on an opaque
object. A luminous source of light, an opaque object and a surface
or a screen to capture the shadow are needed for a visible shadow to form. An opaque object,
when placed in the path of light, will always form a shadow, but the shadow will be visible only
if it gets captured on a screen.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

            </strong>
            Opaque objects do not allow light to pass through them at all.
            Because no light passes through, we cannot see through these
            objects. Examples of opaque objects include wood, stones, and
            metals.

                Translucent Objects:
            </strong>
            Translucent objects allow only a portion of light to pass through
            them. This means that while some light gets through, the objects
            behind the translucent material are not clearly visible. Examples of
            translucent materials include certain types of glass and plastics.

    <ul>
        <li>
            A shadow is formed when an opaque object blocks the path of light.
            Since the light cannot pass through the object, a dark patch appears
            on the other side of the object, which is the shadow.

        <li>
            When an opaque object is placed in the path of light, it will always
            create a shadow. However, the shadow will only be visible if it is
            projected onto a surface or screen. Bright light is needed to create
            a clear and distinct shadow.

"Eclipses
The light from the sun falls on the Earth and illuminates only half of the Earth at any given
time; this half experiences day. The rest of the Earth is in the dark and experiences night.
Similarly, sunlight illuminates the moon. The Earth and the moon are opaque objects.
Hence, the Earth and the moon cast shadows. The eclipse of the sun (solar eclipse) and the eclipse
of the moon (lunar eclipse) occur because of these shadows.
Solar eclipse
On some days, the moon comes exactly in between the sun and the
Earth. On such days, the shadow of the moon falls on some regions
of the Earth. These regions experience a solar eclipse. During a solar
eclipse, some regions on the Earth get covered with the full dark
shadow of the moon (refer to the diagram). Such parts have a total
solar eclipse. During a total solar eclipse, the sun appears fully covered
by the moon and the region turns dark during the day.
During a solar eclipse, some other regions get covered by the partial or faint shadow (refer to the
diagram) of the moon. Such regions experience a partial solar eclipse. A solar eclipse occurs only
on some new-moon days. At any given time during the day, a solar eclipse occurs only in some
regions of the Earth.
Lunar eclipse
The sun illuminates the moon like it does the
Earth, but because the moon revolves around
the Earth, we see the complete bright side of
the moon only once every 28—30 days. This is
the full-moon phase of the moon.
On some Rill-moon nights, the entire bright side of the moon gets covered by the darker portion of
the Earth's shadow. This causes a total lunar eclipse. The full moon appears red during a total lunar
eclipse. If the darker shadow of the Earth falls only on some portions of the moon, then a partial
lunar eclipse occurs.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

        The sun's light shines on half of the Earth at a time, creating day for

        Similarly, sunlight also illuminates the moon, which, like the Earth, is

is an expert in mimicking bird calls. He is also brilliant at
identifying a variety of plants and animals.
To prepare them for the nature walk, Dr Raghu informs
the students that the objective of this walk is to experience
the beauty and variety of plants and animals in the nature.
The students are excited to join them. They are curious
to interact and learn from them. The teacher advises the
students to carry a notebook, a pen and a water bottle.
As they walk, they begin exploring the plants and animals
around them. Dr Raghu advises the students to notice the
variety of smells in the park and emphasises respecting all
living creatures and observing them without disturbing.
Maniram chacha tells the students to not only observe different
plants and animals but also to carefully listen to different
sounds. The students come across a variety ofplants, including
grasses, bushes, and large trees. They also observe a variety
of birds sitting on the branches of trees, butterflies moving
from flower to flower and monkeys jumping from one tree
to another. They record their observations in their notebooks
and discuss them with Dr Raghu and Maniram chacha.
The students can hear the chirping of birds. Dr Raghu
informs them that each bird has a unique chirp. This is an
example of diversity in nature. Dr Raghu requests Maniram
chacha to mimic calls of some birds. Maniram chacha
mimics different bird calls. The students enthusiastically
start copying him.

            Throughout history, India has been known by many names. These names
            were given by the people who lived here and by visitors from other
            countries. We find these names in ancient texts, stories written by
            travelers and pilgrims, and old inscriptions carved in stone. By

"How Indians Named India
The Rig Veda is India's most ancient
text; as we will see in Chapter 7,
it is several thousand years old.
It gives the northwest region of
the Subcontinent the name 'Sapta
Sindhava', that is, the 'land of the
seven rivers'. The word 'Sindhava'
comes from 'Sindhu', which refers
to the Indus River, or at times to a
river in general.

Moving on in time, we see names for other parts of India
appear in the literature. The Mahäbhärata is one of India's
most famous texts (we read about it in the theme 'Our
Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions'). Interestingly,
it lists many regions, such as Käshmira (more or less today's
Kashmir), Kurukshetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga
(parts of Bengal), Prägjyotisha (roughly today's Assam),
Kaccha (today's Kutch), Kerala (more or less today's Kerala),
and so on.

But when do we come across a name for the entire Indian
Subcontinent? Because ancient Indian texts are difficult to
date, this is not an easy question to answer. The Mahäbhärata
uses the terms 'Bhäratavarsha' and 'Jambudvipa', and
scholars generally agree that this long poem was written
from a few centuries BCE onward.
The first term, 'Bhäratavarsha', clearly extends to the entire
Subcontinent, and the text includes the names of numerous
rivers and peoples. 'Bhäratavarsha' means 'the country of
the Bharatas'. 'Bharata' is a name that first appears in the
Rig Veda, where it refers to one of the main Vedic groups
of people. In later literature, several kings named 'Bharata'
are mentioned.

The second term, 'Jambudvipa', means 'the island of the
fruit of the jamun tree'. This is indeed a common tree native
to India, also called 'jambul tree', 'Malabar plum tree', etc.
'Jambudvipa' came to mean the Indian Subcontinent.
In fact, we get a good clue from an Indian emperor — his
name is Aéhoka and we will meet him later; for now, we
can take his date to be about 250 BCE. As we will see, he
left us many inscriptions. In one of them, he used the same name 'Jambudvipa' to describe the whole of India, which
at the time included what is today Bangladesh, Pakistan, as
well as parts of Afghanistan.
A few centuries later, 'Bhärata' became the name generally
used for the Indian Subcontinent. For instance, in an ancient
text called the Vishnu Purana, we read:
This name, 'Bhärata' remains in use even today. In north
India, it is generally written as 'Bharat', while in south
India, it is often 'Bharatam'.
It is interesting to note that different parts of the country
adopted a similar definition for India. For instance, a poem
of ancient Tamil literature, from about 2,000 years ago,
praises a king whose name is known ""from [Cape] Kumari
in the south, from the great mountain in the north, from
the oceans on the east and on the west..."" You can now
recognise 'the great mountain in the north', and it should
not be difficult to identify 'Cape Kumari'. It looks like ancient
Indians knew their geography well!
The Indian Constitution, which was first written in English,
uses the phrase 'India, that is Bharat' right at the beginning.
Similarly, the Hindi version of the Constitution mentions the
same as 'Bhärat arthäth India'.

        When did the entire Indian Subcontinent get a name? This is a tricky

        <strong>
            'Bhäratavarsha' and 'Jambudvipa.'

"How Foreigners Named India
The first foreigners to mention India were the Persians,
the ancient inhabitants of Iran. In the 6th century BCE, a
Persian emperor launched a military campaign and gained
control of the region of the Indus River, which, as we saw,
was earlier called 'Sindhu'. So, it is no surprise that in their
earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred
to India as 'Hind', 'Hidu' or 'Hindu', which are adaptations
in their language of 'Sindhu'. (Note that in ancient Persian,
'Hindu' is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here
to the Hindu religion.)
Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named
the region 'Indoi' or 'Indike'. They dropped the initial letter
'h' of 'Hindu' because this letter did not exist in their Greek
language.
The ancient Chinese also interacted with India. In several
texts, they refer to India as 'Yintu' or 'Yindu'. This word also
originally comes from 'Sindhu', in the following manner:
Another Chinese word, also derived from
'Sindhu', was 'Tianzhu'; but this word could
also be understood as 'heavenly master'. This
reflects the respect the ancient Chinese had
for India as the land of the Buddha.
You are probably quite familiar with a
more recent term, 'Hindustan', but you may
not know that it was first used in a Persian
inscription some 1,800 years ago! Later on, this became
the term used by most invaders of India to describe the
Indian Subcontinent.
Xuanzang (formerly spelt Hiuen Tsang, Hsuan
Tsang, etc.) travelled from China to India in the
7th century CE. He visited many parts of India, met
scholars, collected Buddhist texts, and returned
to China after 17 years. There, he translated
the manuscripts he took back with him from
Sanskrit into Chinese. Several other Chinese
scholars visited India over the centuries.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

India is an ancient land, which has had many names in the

The names given by the ancient inhabitants of India
include 'Jambudvipa' and 'Bhärata'. The latter became
widespread in time and is the name of India in most
Indian languages.
Foreign visitors to, or invaders of, India mostly adopted
names derived from the Sindhu or Indus River; this
resulted in names like 'Hindu', 'Indoi', and eventually

"How Is Time Measured in History?
Each society and culture has had its own ways ofmeasuring
time. Major events, such as the birth of an important
person or the start of a ruler's reign, have often marked
the beginning of a new era. At present, the Gregorian calendar is commonly used worldwide; side by side, Hindu,
Muslim, Jewish, Chinese and other calendars are also used
for calculating the dates of festivals and other auspicious
events.
In the West, the conventional year for Jesus Christ's birth
has generally been taken to be the starting point for this
calendar. Years are counted forward from this point and
used to be marked with 'AD' (an abbreviation for a Latin
phrase that refers to the years after Jesus' birth). However,
this is now called the Common Era or CE across the world.
For example, 1947, the year India gained independence,
can be written as 1947 AD (sometimes AD 1947) or 1947 CE.
Similarly, the years before the conventional date for the
birth of Jesus are counted backward and used to be
marked with BC (or Before Christ). They are now called
Before Common Era or BCE. For example, 560 BCE is an
approximate year of birth of Gautama Buddha.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

Provide Background Information  The background information of any subject should be provided by the teachers to their students on the particular topic. The teacher can refer the students to items like — Articles and books — Museum exhibits — Photographs — Audio and video recordings — Other primary source material — Websites  Students need to know in advance exactly what’s expected of them. Some examples are as follow — Reading up books and periodicals in the library and elsewhere. — Defining enquiry questions, finding and gathering data, creating propositions, proposing solutions etc. — Teamwork and project management agree on tasks and roles, listen to others, prioritise tasks, meet deadlines etc. Establish a General Topic of Enquiry A broad problem question or topic provides students with a general focus for selecting more specific enquiries. Examples are as follow  How are human beings adversely impacting our planet? (exploring environmental issues which impact the forests).  What happens when a tsunami occurs? 4.1.3 Structure of Enquiry The structure of enquiry can be divided into following types  Presentation of Problem The problem faced by students is presented in the form of a challenge.

Scientific evidence has three connotations, which are as follow (i) Observable Outcomes of Scientific Tests Such as experiments, statistical analyses and surveys. (ii) An Indication or a Sign This signifies a reason to believe (or the negation of) a scientific hypothesis. (iii) A Ground for Belief Here, it means something that furnishes proof of or good/cogent reason to believe (or the negation of) a hypothesis. 4.2.1 Induction and Deduction Method  The concept of evidence is related to the concepts of confirmation and induction. Since, hypothesis are confirmed by evidences, induction refers to the mode of reasoning or inference from evidence to hypothesis.  As a hypothesis contains more or at least different, information compared to the evidence, this mode of reasoning enlarges what is already known. This contrasts with deductive reasoning, which proceeds in reverse order from a more general claim to a more specific claim. Unlike deductive reasoning, which is truth preserving, reasoning from evidence is fallible. Principles of Induction and Deduction Various principles of induction and deduction methods are as follow 1. Categorical Induction This is the rule to infer the truth of the hypothesis from the evidence. 2. Enumerative Induction This rule says to infer from a finite set of observed instances to the corresponding generalisation. However, it does not say how many instances must be observed in order to warrant inferring the truth of the generalisation. 3. Eliminative Induction At the end of the enquiry, we can be in the position to infer the truth of some hypothesis since it is the only possible hypothesis left unrefuted by the evidence. As stated by Alexander Bird (2007), “It is the form of inference advocated by Sherlock Holmes in his famous dictum ‘Eliminate the impossible and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth’.” 4.3 Exploration or Research  Discovery or exploration refers to a process in which students take the special law to earn new knowledge.  The exploration method was first rendered by professor Henry Edward Armstrong. The basis of this method was laid by Armstrong on Herbert Spencer statement “Children should be taught as much as possible and encourage them to research as much as possible”.  According to James Drawer, “In any field, the process of sequencing is the only way to research for knowledge and confirmation.”  According to Radman and Meiro, “To acquire new knowledge in sequence is research.”  Research itself is a process of discovery or it is a process to learn ownself. In this, the children are given the opportunity to study, observe and inspect the facts themselves and it is expected from the child that he should know the truth through his efforts and determine the rules. 4.3.1 Merits of Research Various merits of research are as follow  Through research, the students motivated by self by doing and learning. Through research scientific interest and vision arises in the students.  This creates a habit of self-study among students.  The students remain active and the acquired knowledge is permanent.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

        Exploration or Research

    <p>
        Exploration or research is a process through which students acquire new
        knowledge by taking special interest in a subject. This method, proposed
        by Professor Henry Edward Armstrong, encourages students to research as
        much as possible, aligning with Herbert Spencer's idea that children
        should be taught and encouraged to research extensively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Research is viewed as a process of self-discovery, where children study,
        observe, and inspect facts themselves to determine truths and rules.

"Contract under Indian Contract Act
Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines the term contract, as if we see the definition:

“An agreement which is enforceable by law is a contract”.

So by the definition we can easily say that an agreement between two or more parties to do or abstain from doing something.

According to Anson, “the law of contract is that branch of law which determines the circumstances in which a promise shall be legally binding on the person making it”.

Two Important things for the formation of a contract.

(Contract= Agreement + Enforceability)

Illustration– There is an agreement between X and Y that X will construct a house for Y, and Y will pay Rs. 10 Lakhs to X. The agreement between A and B is a contract because it is enforceable by law.
Agreement under Indian Contract Act
Section 2(e) of the Act, defines the term agreement as “Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement”.

Two important things for the formation of an agreement.

                (Agreement= Promise + Consideration)

Important Case- Balfour Vs Balfour [1919] 2 KB 571


In this case, Mr. and Mrs. Balfour, who used to live together as a married couple in Sri Lanka, went for a vacation to England. During this time, Mrs. Balfour developed rheumatic arthritis. The doctor advised Mrs. Balfour to stay back in England as, according to him, Sri Lankan climate would worsen her health. Before Mr. Balfour returned to Sri Lanka, he promised to send £30 to her per month. During their stay away, the parties drifted apart and separated. It was held in this case that Mr. Balfour’s promise to pay a monthly sum of £30 did not amount to a contract, as there was no intention to create a legal relationship on part of either of the parties.

Classification of agreements
Valid Agreements– These agreements are enforceable by law.
Voidable Agreements– It is an agreement which is enforceable by law at the option of one of the parties.
Void Agreements– This agreement is not enforceable by law at all.
Illegal Agreements– these agreements are also not enforceable by law because they are against the law.
Unenforceable Agreements– An unenforceable agreement is one which cannot be enforced in the court of law on account of some technical defects like want of a written form or stamp.
Promise under Indian Contract Act
According to section 2(B) of the act, when the offer is accepted, then it becomes a promise. When a person to whom the offer is made, signifies his assent then we can say that the offer is accepted.

There are mainly four kinds of Promises-

Express Promise (S.9)– When the promise of any offer or acceptance is made in words, then the promise is said to be express.
Implied Promise (S.9)– When the promise of any offer or acceptance is made otherwise than in words, then the promise is said to be implied.
Reciprocal Promise (S.2f)– Promises which form the consideration for each other, are called reciprocal promises.
Alternative Promise (S.58)– An alternative promise is one which offers the choice of one of two things.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

Important Case- Kedarnath Bhattacharji Vs Gorie Mahomed(1887) ILR 14 Cal 64

A Town Hall was planned to build in Howrah. Based on it, all the subscriptions, funds, and interested persons came up for the construction. Municipal Commissioner of Howrah, the Plaintiff entered into an agreement with the contractor and supplied necessary information about the plans. Later on, with an upswing of subscriptions and plans, there was a rise in the cost of construction making it from Rs.20,000 to Rs.40,000. The defendant made a subscription to pay Rs. 100 for the construction of Town Hall. However, he refused to pay the amount.


The Plaintiff commenced an action to claim the amount. The Court held that even if the defendant does not benefit from the promise he made for a charitable purpose, he is liable to pay the amount. He was responsible for his promise. A promise once made cannot be taken back after its commencement. It reaffirmed the rule of law by stating that, “Any act done at the will of the promisor’s wish is taken as the fulfillment of consideration of a contract.”

Types of contracts
There are various types of contracts that are formed voluntarily via civil obligations. They are as follows:

(I) Adhesion Contracts – This type of contracts are those which are formed by the stronger party. It is a sort of, “Opt for it or do not” contract. The stronger party or the one that has the bargaining power leaves the other party with a choice whether to accept or reject the contract.

(II) Aleatory Contracts – This type of contract involves a mutual agreement that comes into being after an unexpected occurrence, accident, or a natural calamity. In this type of contract both the parties have an element of risk. Fire or Car insurances are this type of contract.

(III) Bilateral and Unilateral Contracts – Bilateral contracts involve two parties. Both parties are obliged to one another for performing or abstaining to perform any act. It is also called a two-sided contract as it involves two way promises. Meanwhile, unilateral contracts are those in which the promise is made by only one party. They consist of an offeror and offeree. The offeror makes a promise to perform an action and is bound by the law to do so. The offeree is not bound to the court even if he fails to execute the requested action because he does not promise anything at all.

(IV) Express Contracts – These contracts are those wherein the terms of the contracts are expressed clearly whether in written documents or orally.

(V) Implied Contracts – There is no oral or written terms in this type of contract. The contracts are assumed owing to the facts of the parties. If an individual visits a medical professional, he expects to be diagnosed for a disease or illness and be advised a cure. This is an implied contract and a patient is capable of suing a medical practitioner for malpractice.

(VI) Void and Voidable Contracts – Void contracts are illegal from the very beginning and hold no validity under law. They are thereby un-enforceable. Voidable contracts are unlike void contracts in the sense that one party is bound by the contract and the unbound party is capable to terminate the contract as they are unbound to it.

And a quasi-contract is unlike a real contract. Salmond defines quasi contracts as “there are certain obligations which are not in truth contractual in the sense of resting on agreement, but which the law treats as if they were”. It is important to remember that even though it is imposed by law, it is not created by the operation of the contract.


Proposal under Indian Contract Act
According to Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 proposal has been defined as “when one person will signify to another person his willingness to do or not do something (abstain) with a view to obtain the assent of such person to such an act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal or an offer.”

The person making the offer/proposal is known as the “promisor” or the “offeror”. And the person who may accept such an offer will be the “promisee” or the “acceptor”.

-What is a General Offer?

A general offer is any offer which is not made to a definitive person but rather to the public at large or the entire world which includes any individual that may understand the offer and accept it.

Important Case: Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v. Boots Cash Chemists Ltd. – When the goods are displayed either in a show-window or inside the shop and such goods bear price-tags, the question which arises in such case is, whether that amounts to an offer to sell goods at prices mentioned on the price tags. In this case, it was held that display of goods alongwith price tags merely amounts to invitation to treat and therefore if an intending buyer is willing to purchase the goods at a price mentioned on the tag, he makes an offer to buy the goods. Thus, the shopkeeper has the right to accept or reject the same. The contract would arise only when the offer is accepted.

Can a Offer lead to a Contract?
Case: Carlill Vs Carbolic Smoke Balls Company

In this case, a company carried out advertisements about their product, carbolic smoke balls, that claimed that any person who took the smoke balls in the prescribed manner (i.e., three times daily for two weeks) will not catch influenza. In case someone does, the company promised to pay 100£ to them immediately. To show their sincerity regarding this offer, the company deposited a sum of 1000£ in a public bank. Now, the plaintiff, Carlill bought the smoke balls and used them as prescribed in the advertisement, but still ended up catching the flu. She filed a suit for the recovery of 100£ as promised in the advertisement. The company denied the payment saying there existed no contract between them and the plaintiff. It was held that a contract came into existence between the plaintiff and the company as soon as the plaintiff bought the smoke balls and used them as prescribed.

                <li>
                    The advertisement promised to pay £100 to anyone who used

"Contracts are an integral part of business and personal transactions. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates a legal obligation to perform specific acts. 

Contracts can be classified into various types based on their formation, validity, nature, and execution. Understanding the different types of contracts is crucial for creating and enforcing legally binding agreements. In this article, we will discuss the different types of contracts based on these criteria, along with examples and relevant provisions in India.
Types of contracts on the basis of the formation of the contract
Contracts can be classified into various types based on their formation. Here are the most common types of contracts and their characteristics, along with examples and relevant provisions in India:

Verbal Contracts
A verbal contract is an agreement that is made orally, without any written documentation. These types of contracts are based on trust between the parties involved and are enforceable by law. However, it is difficult to prove the terms of the agreement in court if there is no written record.

Example: A customer orders a custom-made cake over the phone and agrees to pay the baker a certain amount. The baker delivers the cake, but the customer refuses to pay the full amount, claiming that the cake was not as requested.

Provision in India: According to Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, all agreements that meet the requirements of a valid contract, including verbal agreements, are legally binding.

Written Contracts
A written contract is an agreement that is recorded in writing and signed by both parties. This type of contract provides clarity and reduces the likelihood of disputes, as the terms are clearly defined in writing.


Example: A company hires an employee and provides them with a written employment contract that outlines the terms of employment, such as salary, benefits, and job responsibilities.

Provision in India: According to Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a contract is an agreement that is enforceable by law, and it may be either written or oral.

Express Contracts
An express contract is an agreement in which the terms and conditions are explicitly stated, either verbally or in writing. This type of contract is legally binding and enforceable.

Example: A contractor agrees to build a house for a client for a fixed price, and the terms and conditions of the agreement are clearly stated in a written contract.


Provision in India: According to Section 9 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, an express contract is formed when the parties explicitly agree to the terms and conditions of the agreement.

Implied Contracts
An implied contract is an agreement that is not expressed in words, but is inferred from the actions and behavior of the parties involved. This type of contract is based on the conduct of the parties rather than any explicit agreement.

Example: A customer enters a store and selects an item to purchase. The customer offers to pay the price displayed, and the cashier accepts the payment. Although there is no written or verbal agreement, an implied contract is formed between the customer and the store.

Provision in India: According to Section 9 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, an implied contract is formed based on the conduct of the parties involved.

Quasi-Contracts
A quasi-contract is a legal agreement that is created by the court in the absence of an actual contract. This type of contract is based on the principle of equity, and it is intended to prevent unjust enrichment.

Example: A person accidentally damages someone else’s property and voluntarily agrees to pay for the repairs. Although there was no actual contract between the parties, a quasi-contract is formed based on the principle of unjust enrichment.

Provision in India: According to Section 68 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a quasi-contract is created by the court to prevent unjust enrichment.

E-contracts
An e-contract is a contract that is formed over the internet or through other electronic means, such as email or electronic signatures. This type of contract is legally binding and enforceable.


Example: A customer purchases a product from an online retailer and agrees to the terms and conditions of the sale, which are displayed on the website. The retailer sends a confirmation email to the customer, which serves as evidence of the agreement.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

"Types of contracts on the basis of nature of the contracts
Apart from the formation of the contract, contracts can also be classified on the basis of their validity. Here are the most common types of contracts based on their validity, along with examples and relevant provisions in India:

Valid Contracts 
A valid contract is an agreement that meets all the legal requirements of a contract, such as the presence of offer, acceptance, consideration, and capacity to contract. This type of contract is legally binding and enforceable by law.

Example: A person agrees to purchase a car from a dealership for an agreed-upon price. The contract is in writing and signed by both parties.

Provision in India: According to Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, all agreements that meet the requirements of a valid contract, including free consent, lawful object, and consideration, are legally binding.

Void Contracts
A void contract is an agreement that is not legally binding and has no legal effect. This type of contract is null and void from the beginning and cannot be enforced by law.

Example: A person enters into an agreement to purchase illegal drugs. The contract is void, as the object of the contract is illegal.

Provision in India: According to Section 2(j) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a contract that is not enforceable by law is void.

Voidable Contracts
A voidable contract is an agreement that is legally binding, but one or both parties have the option to void or cancel the contract due to certain legal or factual defects. This type of contract is enforceable unless it is avoided or canceled by one of the parties.


Example:

Provision in India: According to Section 2(i) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a contract is voidable if it is enforceable by law at the option of one or more parties.

Void-ab-initio Contracts
A void-ab-initio contract is an agreement that is illegal and void from the beginning due to the nature of the contract or its object. This type of contract is not enforceable by law and has no legal effect.

Example: A minor enters into a contract to purchase a car. The agreement is void ab initio.

Unenforceable Contracts
An unenforceable contract is a valid agreement that cannot be enforced by law due to certain legal or factual reasons, such as the lack of a written agreement or the expiration of the statute of limitations. This type of contract is valid, but it cannot be enforced by law.

Illegal Contracts 
An illegal contract is an agreement that involves an illegal act or is against public policy. This type of contract is void and unenforceable by law.


Example: A person enters into an agreement to bribe a government official. The contract is illegal, as it involves an illegal act.

"Types of contracts on the basis of the nature of the contracts
Contracts can also be classified based on the nature of the contract. Here are the most common types of contracts based on their nature, along with examples and relevant provisions in India:

Unilateral Contracts
A unilateral contract is a type of contract in which one party makes a promise to do something in exchange for a specific performance from the other party. The contract is formed when the other party performs the required act.

Example: A company offers a reward to anyone who finds a lost item. The contract is formed when a person finds the lost item and performs the required act of returning it.

Provision in India: According to Section 2(f) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a contract is considered unilateral when only one party makes a promise or offers an act in exchange for the performance of an act by the other party.

Bilateral Contracts
A bilateral contract is a type of contract in which both parties make promises to each other to perform specific acts. The contract is formed when both parties agree to the terms of the contract.


Example: A person agrees to purchase a car from a dealership for an agreed-upon price, and the dealership agrees to sell the car for the agreed-upon price. Both parties have made promises to each other.

Provision in India: According to Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a contract is considered bilateral when both parties make promises to each other to perform specific acts.

Unconscionable Contracts
An unconscionable contract is a type of contract in which one party takes advantage of the other party’s weaker bargaining position to impose unfair or unreasonable terms. The contract is considered unfair or unconscionable.

Example: A landlord forces a tenant to sign a lease agreement with excessive rent and unreasonable terms. The contract is considered unconscionable because the tenant has no choice but to agree to the terms.

Provision in India: There is no specific provision in the Indian Contract Act, 1872, for unconscionable contracts. However, the Indian courts have recognized the principle of unconscionability in certain cases.


Adhesion Contracts/Standard Form Contracts
An adhesion contract or a standard form contract is a type of contract in which one party has all the bargaining power and presents the other party with a take-it-or-leave-it offer. The other party has no choice but to accept the terms of the contract.

Example: A person signs a software license agreement without reading the terms and conditions, as they have no choice but to accept the terms to use the software.

Provision in India: There is no specific provision in the Indian Contract Act, 1872, for adhesion contracts. However, the Indian courts have recognised the principle of unconscionability in certain cases.

Aleatory Contracts/Contingent Contracts
An aleatory contract is a type of contract in which the performance of one or both parties is contingent on an uncertain event. The contract is formed when an uncertain event occurs.

Example: A person purchases an insurance policy that pays out if a specific event, such as a fire or flood, occurs. The contract is formed when the event occurs.

Provision in India: According to Section 30 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, an aleatory contract is a contract in which the performance of one or both parties is contingent on an uncertain event.

Option Contracts
An option contract is a type of contract in which one party grants the other party the right to buy or sell a specific asset at a specific price within a specific time frame. The other party is not obligated to buy or sell the asset.

Example: A person pays a premium for the option to buy a house at a specific price within a specific time frame. The person is not obligated to buy the house but has the option to do so.

Provision in India: Option contracts are recognized under Indian contract law. According to Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a contract is a legally enforceable agreement that creates an obligation to perform certain acts. Option contracts are considered enforceable agreements that grant one party the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific asset.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

"A proposal is defined as an offer made by one party to another party with the intention of entering into a legally binding agreement. It is an expression of willingness to do or not to do something, forming the basis of a contract.
The proposal under Indian Contract Act
According to Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, “when one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal”.

A proposal must be definite and specific in its terms, and it should be communicated to the other party with the intention of obtaining their acceptance. Once the other party accepts the proposal, it becomes a promise, and the terms of the contract bind the parties. If the proposal is not accepted, it will be considered a mere invitation to offer, and it will not create any legal obligation between the parties.

Examples

A company (A) offers to sell its products to another company (B) for a certain price. The offer is made in writing and sent via email to company B. This offer is a proposal, and if company B accepts the offer, it becomes a binding contract.

    <ul>
        <li>
            A proposal, as per the Indian Contract Act, 1872, is an offer made
            by one party to another with the intention of forming a legally
            binding agreement. It signifies a willingness to do or not do
            something, laying the groundwork for a contract.
        </li>
        <li>
            According to Section 2(a) of the Indian Contract Act, a proposal is
            when one person communicates their willingness to perform or abstain
            from an action to another, seeking their agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
            For a proposal to be valid, it must be clear, specific, and
            communicated with the intent of securing acceptance. Once accepted,
            it transforms into a promise, binding the parties to the contract.
            If not accepted, it remains an invitation to offer, lacking legal
            force.

"What is an invitation to offer?
An invitation to offer is a preliminary communication that invites or encourages someone to make an offer or proposal, rather than being an actual offer itself. It is an invitation to negotiate or make an offer, which may or may not result in the formation of a contract.

In simple terms, an invitation to offer is an invitation to commence negotiations or discussions, and it does not create a legal obligation to accept any resulting offer.

Examples of an invitation to offer include advertisements, price lists, catalogues, and displays of goods in a shop window or online store. These do not constitute a binding offer, but rather an invitation to customers to make an offer to purchase.


For example, a shop owner displaying goods in their store window is an invitation to customers to make an offer to purchase those goods. The customer’s offer to purchase the goods at a certain price would constitute a proposal, and the shop owner’s acceptance of the proposal would form a binding contract.

Landmark cases dealing with invitations to treat/offer
Pharmaceutical Products of India Ltd. v. Gwalior Chemical Works Ltd. (1960)
In this case, the court held that a price list is an invitation to treat and not an offer or proposal. The court held that a contract is only formed when an offer is made by one party and accepted by the other.

Fisher v. Bell (1961)
This case established the principle that a display of goods in a shop window or on a shelf is generally an invitation to treat and not an offer. The customer’s offer to purchase the goods at a certain price would constitute a proposal, and the shop owner’s acceptance of the proposal would form a binding contract.

Harvela Investments Ltd. v. Royal Trust Co. of Canada (1986)
This case established the principle of the “invitation to tender,” which is a process by which a party invites potential contractors to submit bids for a project. The court held that an invitation to tender is not an offer, but rather an invitation to submit offers.


Mohanlal v. Kashiram (1962)
In this case, the court held that an advertisement for the sale of property is an invitation to treat and not an offer. The court held that a contract is only formed when an offer is made by one party and accepted by the other.

Harvey v Facey (1893)
In this case, the plaintiff (Harvey) telegraphed the defendant (Facey) asking if he would sell certain property and, if so, at what price. The defendant replied with a telegraph that simply stated the lowest price that he would accept for the property. The plaintiff then claimed that the defendant had made an offer to sell the property at that price, which he had accepted by his subsequent telegraphs.

The court, however, held that the defendant’s telegraph was not an offer to sell the property, but rather a mere statement of the lowest price he would accept. The court held that the defendant had not made any offer, and therefore there was no contract between the parties.

The court further explained that an invitation to treat is not an offer, but rather an invitation to commence negotiations or discussions. The court held that the defendant’s telegraph was an invitation to treat, and not an offer to sell the property.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

        Understanding Invitation to Offer
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            An invitation to offer is a preliminary communication that
            encourages someone to make a proposal, rather than constituting a
            formal offer. It serves as an invitation to negotiate or initiate
            discussions, potentially leading to the formation of a contract.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put simply, an invitation to offer does not impose a legal
            obligation to accept any resulting proposal. It sets the stage for
            potential offers and counteroffers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Common examples of invitations to offer include advertisements,
            price lists, catalogues, and product displays in physical stores or
            online platforms. These forms of communication do not signify a
            binding commitment but rather beckon customers to make purchase
            proposals.

                Illustrative Examples:
            </strong>
            Imagine a scenario where a shop showcases merchandise in its window.
            This act is an invitation for customers to submit offers to buy
            those items. When a customer presents an offer to purchase a
            specific product at a specified price, it represents a proposal. If
            the shop owner agrees to the proposal, a legally binding contract is
            formed.

"Intention to create a legal relationship
The intention to create a legal relationship is a key element in the formation of a contract. It refers to the intention of the parties to create a legally binding agreement, i.e. an agreement that can be enforced by law.

In general, the law assumes that parties intend to create a legal relationship when they enter into a contract. However, in certain situations, the parties may not intend to create a legally binding agreement, such as in social or domestic arrangements. For example, if friends agree to meet at a café, there may not be an intention to create a legally binding agreement.

In order for a contract to be enforceable, the intention to create a legal relationship must be present at the time of entering into the agreement. This means that both parties must have a common intention to create legal relations.

The intention to create a legal relationship can be expressed or implied. It may be expressed through the language used in the contract, such as when the parties state explicitly that they intend to create a legally binding agreement. Alternatively, the intention may be implied from the circumstances surrounding the agreement. For example, if a person provides a service and is paid for it, there may be an implied intention to create a legal relationship.


If the parties do not have the intention to create a legal relationship, the agreement will not be enforceable as a contract. Therefore, the presence or absence of the intention to create a legal relationship is a crucial factor in determining the validity of a contract.

Balfour v Balfour 
Balfour v Balfour is a landmark case in the law of contract that deals with the issue of intention to create a legal relationship. The case was decided by the English Court of Appeal in 1919.

In this case, Mr. Balfour was a British civil servant who was posted to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1915. At that time, his wife, Mrs. Balfour, remained in England due to health reasons. Before leaving, Mr. Balfour promised to pay his wife a monthly allowance of £30 until she joined him in Ceylon. However, the couple later separated and Mrs. Balfour sued her husband for breach of contract, claiming the unpaid allowance.

The court held that there was no contract between the parties. The court found that the promise made by Mr. Balfour was a mere social arrangement between husband and wife, and not intended to create a legal relationship. The court noted that not all agreements between family members or spouses are legally binding and that the intention to create a legal relationship must be present in order for a contract to be enforceable.

The court explained that in the absence of an intention to create a legal relationship, there is no consideration, which is an essential element of a contract. Consideration refers to the exchange of something of value, such as money or services, between the parties. In this case, Mrs. Balfour had not given any consideration in exchange for the promise made by her husband.

Therefore, the case established the principle that a social or domestic agreement, made without any intention to create a legal relationship, does not give rise to a binding contract.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

        Understanding the Intention to Create a Legal Relationship

            <strong>
                Definition:
            </strong>
            The intention to create a legal relationship is a fundamental aspect
            in forming a contract. It signifies the parties' purpose to enter
            into a legally binding agreement that can be upheld by law.

        <li>
            <strong>
                Presumption:
            </strong>
            Generally, the law assumes that parties intend to create a legal
            relationship when they engage in a contract. However, there are
            instances, such as in social or domestic scenarios, where the
            parties may not have this intention. For instance, when friends
            agree to meet at a cafe, there might not be a legal commitment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Essential Requirement:
            </strong>
            For a contract to be valid and enforceable, both parties must
            mutually intend to create legal relations at the time of entering
            the agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Express vs. Implied:
            </strong>
            The intention to create a legal relationship can be either expressed
            or implied. It is expressed when parties explicitly state their
            intention in the contract's language. Conversely, it is implied from
            the circumstances of the agreement. For instance, if someone
            provides a service and receives payment, there is an implied
            intention to create a legal relationship.

            <strong>
                Enforceability:
            </strong>
            If the parties lack the intention to create a legal relationship,
            the agreement cannot be enforced as a contract. Therefore, the
            presence or absence of this intention is pivotal in determining a
            contract's validity.

                contract law. It was decided by the English Court of Appeal in
                1919.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mr. Balfour, a British civil servant, was sent to Ceylon in 1915
                while his wife, Mrs. Balfour, stayed in England for health
                reasons. Before departing, Mr. Balfour promised to give his wife
                a monthly allowance of £30 until she joined him in Ceylon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Following their separation, Mrs. Balfour sued her husband for
                not fulfilling the promised allowance, alleging a breach of
                contract.
            </li>
            <li>
                The court ruled that no legally binding contract existed between
                the spouses. It determined that Mr. Balfour's promise was a
                social agreement between husband and wife, lacking the intention
                to create a legal relationship.
            </li>
            <li>
                Not all agreements within families or between spouses are
                enforceable contracts, as highlighted by this case. For a
                contract to be valid, there must be an intention to create a
                legal relationship.
            </li>
            <li>
                The court emphasized the importance of consideration in
                contracts. Consideration involves the exchange of something
                valuable, like money or services, between parties. In this
                instance, Mrs. Balfour did not provide any consideration in
                return for her husband's promise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Therefore, Balfour v Balfour set the precedent that social or
                domestic agreements, lacking the intent to establish a legal
                relationship, do not lead to legally binding contracts.

"Merritt v Merritt
Merritt v Merritt is a landmark case in the law of contract that deals with the issue of intention to create a legal relationship. The case was decided by the English Court of Appeal in 1970.

In this case, Mr. and Mrs. Merritt were a married couple who had separated, but had not yet divorced. They owned a house jointly, and had agreed to transfer ownership of the house to Mrs. Merritt in exchange for her agreement to pay off the outstanding mortgage on the property. The couple had made a written agreement to this effect, which was signed by both parties.

After Mrs. Merritt had paid off the mortgage, Mr. Merritt refused to transfer ownership of the house to her. Mrs. Merritt sued her husband for breach of contract, claiming ownership of the property.


The court held that there was a valid and enforceable contract between the parties. The court found that the written agreement signed by the parties was evidence of their intention to create a legal relationship, and that both parties had given consideration in exchange for the promise made by the other. Mrs. Merritt had promised to pay off the mortgage, and Mr. Merritt had promised to transfer ownership of the house.

The court explained that the fact that the parties were married did not necessarily mean that there was no intention to create a legal relationship. The court noted that the parties were separated and had agreed to transfer ownership of the property in exchange for Mrs. Merritt’s payment of the mortgage. The court found that the agreement was not merely a domestic arrangement, but a binding and enforceable contract.

Therefore, the case established the principle that an agreement made between spouses or family members may give rise to a binding contract, provided that there is evidence of an intention to create a legal relationship, and that both parties have given consideration in exchange for the promise made by the other.

Communication of offer is necessary
Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt is a landmark case in the law of contract that deals with the issue of offer and acceptance. The case was decided by the Privy Council in 1913.

In this case, Lalman Shukla was a servant of Gauri Dutt, who was the uncle of Lalman’s deceased father. Gauri Dutt had sent Lalman to search for his missing nephew, and had promised to pay a reward of Rs. 501 to anyone who could find him. However, before Lalman could return with the news that Gauri Dutt’s nephew had been found, Gauri Dutt learned of his nephew’s death from other sources.

Gauri Dutt then refused to pay Lalman the promised reward, claiming that the offer of the reward was made only for the purpose of finding his nephew alive, and that since his nephew was now dead, there was no offer to be accepted.

The court held that there was no contract between the parties. The court found that Gauri Dutt’s promise to pay the reward was an offer, and that Lalman’s search for his nephew was an acceptance of that offer. The court noted that an offer can be accepted by performing the requested act, and that Lalman’s search was the performance of the requested act.


The court rejected Gauri Dutt’s argument that the offer was only for the purpose of finding his nephew alive. The court explained that the offer was not limited to finding the nephew alive, but was for the act of finding the nephew, regardless of whether he was alive or dead. Therefore, the court found that Lalman had accepted the offer by performing the requested act, and that Gauri Dutt was bound to pay the promised reward.

Therefore, the case established the principle that an offer can be accepted by performing the requested act, and that an offer may be for a specific act rather than a specific result.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

                <li>
                    It was established that both parties intended to create a

                    It highlighted that despite their marital status, the
                    agreement between the parties was not merely a domestic
                    arrangement but a legally binding contract.

                    Lalman Shukla, serving under his deceased father's uncle
                    Gauri Dutt, was tasked with locating Gauri Dutt's missing

"Types of Offer/Proposals
Cross Offers
A cross offer occurs when two parties make identical offers to each other without knowing that the other has made an offer. In such a situation, neither party can accept the other’s offer, as there is no clear indication of an intention to create a legally binding agreement. Here are a few landmark cases related to cross offers:

Tinn v. Hoffman (1873)
In this case, the plaintiff and the defendant were negotiating the sale of a quantity of tin. The plaintiff sent a letter offering to sell the tin at a certain price, and the defendant sent a letter in response, also offering to buy the tin at the same price. However, neither party had received the other’s letter at the time they made their offer. The court held that there was no contract between the parties, as neither party had accepted the other’s offer.

Counter Offer
A counter-offer is a response to an initial offer that varies the terms of the original offer. It is essentially a rejection of the original offer, and it terminates the initial offer. Here are a few landmark cases related to counter-offers:

Hyde v. Wrench (1840)
In this case, the defendant offered to sell his estate to the plaintiff for a certain price. The plaintiff made a counteroffer for a lower price, which the defendant rejected. The plaintiff then attempted to accept the defendant’s original offer, but the defendant refused to sell. The court held that there was no contract between the parties, as the plaintiff’s counteroffer amounted to a rejection of the defendant’s offer.

Specific and general offers
In contract law, an offer is a proposal made by one party (the offeror) to another party (the offeree) with the intention of creating a legally binding agreement. Offers can be categorized into two main types: specific offers and general offers.


A specific offer is an offer made to a specific person or group of people. For example, if a person offers to sell their car to a particular individual for a certain price, this is a specific offer. Specific offers can only be accepted by the person or group of people to whom they are addressed. If the offer is not accepted within the specified time period or on the specific terms outlined in the offer, it lapses and cannot be accepted later.

A general offer, on the other hand, is an offer made to the public at large or a group of people who may accept it. 

For example, an advertisement offering a reward for the return of a lost item is a general offer. Anyone who finds the lost item and meets the conditions of the offer can claim the reward. The key difference between a specific offer and a general offer is that a general offer can be accepted by anyone who meets the conditions of the offer.

It is important to note that specific and general offers have different legal implications. For instance, in the case of a specific offer, the offeror is obligated to sell the item to the offeree if the offeree accepts the offer within the specified time period and on the specific terms outlined in the offer. 

In the case of a general offer, the offeror is only obligated to fulfil the offer if someone meets the conditions of the offer and accepts it.


Overall, the distinction between specific and general offers is an important one in contract law, as it determines the legal implications of an offer and the conditions under which it can be accepted.

                <li>
                    An offer in contract law refers to a proposal put forth by
                    one party (the offeror) to another party (the offeree) with
                    the aim of establishing a legally binding agreement.

                        <li>
                            A specific offer is directed towards a particular
                            individual or a specific group of people.

                        <li>
                            For instance, when someone offers to sell their car
                            to a specific person at a defined price, it
                            constitutes a specific offer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Specific offers can only be accepted by the
                            individual or group to whom they are addressed.

                            In contrast, a general offer is extended to the
                            public at large or to a group of individuals who can

                        <li>
                            For example, an advertisement offering a reward for
                            a lost item is a general offer where anyone who
                            finds the lost item and fulfills the conditions can
                            claim the reward.

"Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company (1893)
One landmark case related to the distinction between specific and general offers is Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company (1893). In this case, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company made a general offer through newspaper advertisements promising a reward to anyone who used their product and still contracted influenza. The advertisement stated that the company had deposited 1,000 pounds in a bank to show their sincerity in carrying out the offer.

Mrs. Carlill purchased and used the product as directed but still contracted influenza. She sued the company for the reward, arguing that she had accepted the general offer by using the product as directed. The company argued that the advertisement was not a specific offer to Mrs. Carlill, and therefore there was no contract between them.

The court ruled in favour of Mrs. Carlill, holding that the advertisement constituted a general offer that she had accepted by using the product as directed. The court held that the advertisement contained specific terms that could be reasonably interpreted as an offer, and that Mrs. Carlill had provided consideration (i.e. using the product as directed) in exchange for the promise of a reward. The court further held that the deposit of 1,000 pounds in a bank demonstrated the company’s intent to be bound by the offer. This case is often cited as a landmark case on the distinction between specific and general offers.

Standing, open and continuing offers
In contract law, offers can be classified into different types based on their duration and ability to be accepted. The three main types of offers are standing offers, open offers, and continuing offers.

Standing offers
A standing offer is an offer that is made to a particular person or group of people and is valid for a specific period. It is a type of specific offer that remains open for acceptance during the specified period. For example, if a company offers to sell a particular product to a specific customer at a fixed price for a period of one year, this would be a standing offer.

Open offers 
An open offer is a type of general offer that is open to anyone who meets the specified conditions. It is an offer that remains open for a reasonable period and can be accepted by anyone who meets the specified conditions. For example, if a company offers a reward to anyone who returns a lost item, this would be an open offer.

Continuing offers
A continuing offer is an offer that remains open for a specified period but can be accepted multiple times during that period. For example, if a company offers to supply a particular product to a customer at a fixed price for a period of one year, and the customer can place orders for the product during that period, this would be a continuing offer.

It is important to note that the legal implications of these different types of offers can vary. For instance, a standing offer can only be accepted by the person or group of people to whom it is addressed and only within the specified period. An open offer can be accepted by anyone who meets the specified conditions within a reasonable period, while a continuing offer can be accepted multiple times within the specified period.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

    <h3>
        Standing Offers
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A standing offer is a specific type of offer that is directed
            towards a particular individual or group and remains open for
            acceptance for a defined period. For instance, if a company offers
            to sell a specific product to a customer at a fixed price for one
            year, it constitutes a standing offer.
        </li>

    <h3>
        Open Offers
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            An open offer is a general type of offer that is available to anyone
            who fulfills the specified conditions. This offer remains open for a
            reasonable period and can be accepted by anyone meeting the
            requirements. For example, a company offering a reward for returning
            a lost item extends an open offer.

    <h3>
        Continuing Offers

    <ul>
        <li>
            A continuing offer is open for a set duration but can be accepted
            multiple times within that period. For instance, a company offering
            to supply a product at a fixed price for a year, allowing the
            customer to place multiple orders during that timeframe, exemplifies
            a continuing offer.

            must be accepted within the designated timeframe.
        </li>
        <li>
            Open offers can be accepted by anyone who meets the conditions
            within a reasonable period.
        </li>
        <li>
            Continuing offers allow for multiple acceptances during the

"Bengal Coal Co v Homee Wadia & Co
The case of Bengal Coal Co v Homee Wadia & Co (1912) is a landmark case in the area of standing, open and continuing offers.

In this case, the Bengal Coal Co. offered to sell a certain quantity of coal to Homee Wadia & Co., stating that the offer would remain open until a specific date. Homee Wadia & Co. did not accept the offer within the specified time frame but attempted to do so after the date had passed. The Bengal Coal Co. refused to accept the order, arguing that the offer had lapsed.

The court held that the offer made by the Bengal Coal Co. was a standing offer, and since it had not been accepted within the specified time frame, it had lapsed. The court stated that the nature of the offer was such that it could only be accepted within the specified period, and once that period had expired, the offer was no longer valid.


This case established the principle that a standing offer can only be accepted within the specified period, and once that period has expired, the offer lapses. It also emphasizes the importance of the terms and conditions of an offer, and how they can impact the validity of the offer.

Rajendra Kumar v State of Madhya Pradesh
The case of Rajendra Kumar v State of Madhya Pradesh (1977) is a landmark case related to the doctrine of continuing offers in contract law.

In this case, Rajendra Kumar applied for a post in the state government and was selected for the job. He was given an appointment letter, which stated that he had to report for duty within a specified period, failing which his appointment would be deemed as cancelled. Rajendra Kumar failed to report for duty within the specified period, and his appointment was cancelled.

Rajendra Kumar challenged the cancellation of his appointment, arguing that the offer made by the state government was a continuing offer, and therefore, he had the right to report for duty at any time. The state government argued that the offer was not a continuing offer, and the appointment was cancelled due to the failure of the applicant to report for duty within the specified period.


The court held that the offer made by the state government was not a continuing offer, and the applicant had to report for duty within the specified period. The court emphasized that the terms of the offer must be clear and unambiguous, and in the absence of any ambiguity, the court must give effect to the terms of the offer.

This case established the principle that the doctrine of continuing offer applies only when the offer is clear and unambiguous, and the terms of the offer provide for a continuing acceptance. It highlights the importance of the terms and conditions of an offer and their interpretation in determining the validity of the offer.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

"Agreement
 The definition of the agreement is defined in section 2(e) of the Indian Contract Act 1872. An agreement is a kind of promise between the two parties, there is a consideration also involve in it. The perfect example of the agreement is the rent agreement. In the rent agreement, both parties (the owner and the tenant) involve, the consideration is in the form of the money, rent etc.

 There is various important aspect that is necessary for the agreement and is as follows –

Parties- there is always a minimum of two parties involved in the agreement and, more than two parties also. It is totally depending upon the conditions or circumstances.
Offer- there must be an offer between two parties, one party have to make an offer to another party and this offer is also mentioned in the agreement.
Acceptance – one party made an offer and another party have to accept the offer. Acceptance of the party is very important for the agreement and the acceptance should be according to the will of the party.
Promises- both parties have to promise that they fulfil all the duties and obligations mentioned in the agreement.
Consideration- consideration means the money in any form or the price for the promise we can say.
It is not possible that all the agreements are valid agreements. Sometimes the agreements are void or considered null. It is important for all of us to understand that what are the certain conditions which are not valid in the eyes of law-

1. No consideration- first is that, if there is no consideration for the promise mentioned in the agreement it means that there is no price/ money involved between the two parties. For a valid agreement, there should be a consideration.

2. Agreement in restrain the trade- If one party mentioned that the other party was not to do any word or in simple words, one party restrain the other party to do any kind of trade or business or any work for the livelihood of the rest of life. Then in this case the contract between the two parties is void and there is no legal agreement formed.

3. Agreement to restrain marriage- If one party restrain the other person to not marry any other person and in return he/ she will gift something but that person can’t marry for the rest of his life. This agreement or contract is not valid.

4. Agreement to restrain of legal proceedings- It means that, if one party interfere with another party to not involved in any kind of legal proceeding then that contract is considered as null and void contract. This is not right in the eyes of law.


5. Impossible act- If one party mention the condition to an act which is impossible in nature then that agreement is considered to be null and void because it states that the condition is impossible to do by a party.

All these conditions should be fulfilled for a valid agreement, if one of the conditions is mentioned in the contract which is illegal in the eyes of the law, then it is a void agreement under the Indian contract act.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

        Section 5 Of the Indian Contract Act - Revocation Of The Proposal And
        Acceptance
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The proposal within the Indian Contract Act can be withdrawn before
            it is accepted by the promisee.
        </li>
        <li>
            For instance, if person X offers to sell a watch to person Y, X can
            withdraw the offer before Y accepts it.
        </li>
        <li>
            The proposal remains revocable until the moment of acceptance by the
            other party.

        Section 6 Of the Indian Contract Act - Revocation How Made
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Revocation of a proposal is possible through the communication of a
            notice of revocation by the proposer to the other party.
        </li>
        <li>
            Revocation can also occur by the lapse of time. If the offeree fails
            to accept the offer within the stipulated time, the proposer has the
            right to revoke. In cases where no specific time is mentioned, a
            reasonable time frame is considered based on the circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
            Failure to meet the conditions set by the acceptor can lead to
            revocation. If the conditions outlined by one party in the contract
            are not met, the contract can be revoked.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the proposer passes away before the acceptance of the offer and
            the acceptor becomes aware of this fact, the agreement can be
            revoked. If the death of the proposer occurs before acceptance, the
            agreement is no longer valid.

        Section 7: Acceptance Requirements in the Indian Contract Act
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Acceptance is a crucial element in the transformation of a proposal
            into a promise within the Indian Contract Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is essential that acceptance is absolute and unqualified,
            underscoring its significance in every agreement or contract.
        </li>
        <li>
            Expressing acceptance in a clear and reasonable manner is important
            to ensure that the other party is aware of your decision to accept
            the offer. If the proposal specifies a particular method of
            acceptance, failing to adhere to it may lead the proposer to
            communicate, within a reasonable timeframe, the requirement for
            acceptance in the prescribed manner. However, if such communication
            is not made, the acceptance is still valid.
        </li>
    </ul>"
"Section 8 Of The Indian Contract Act – Acceptance By Performing, Conditions, Or Receiving Consideration
If there is a condition in the offer and the acceptor accept the conditions, then it is said to be the acceptance of the offer by the acceptor; if there is the acceptance of the consideration then it is said to be the acceptance of the proposal, the person cannot return the goods.

Section 9 Of The Indian Contract Act –  Promises, Express And Implied
It talks about the implied and expressed promises, in this if the proposal and the acceptance is done in words or writing then it is said to be expressed promises while such promise done other than words said to be implied promises.

E.g., if x parks his car and z come and start cleaning the care it is said to be the implied offer as it is done by z with his own wish.

The Facts of the Case

There were quarrels and disagreements between husband and her wife.
Husband promised to pay some amount to his wife for the maintenance, to get rid of her.
This was registered and later the husband denied paying the amount and his wife sued him for recovery of the money.
Contention Of The Parties

There was a written and registered contract between then in a near relation so there must be an intention to sue so she should get the money.

Decision Of The Court

As there was no love and affection but there was near relation, written and registered agreement in this situation there is a requirement of consideration so this contract without consideration was not valid but if same was done to make a valid contract out of natural love and affection there will be no requirement of consideration and it is said to be a valid agreement.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

"According to Section 2(b) of the Indian Contract Act 1872, acceptance is the act of signifying assent to a proposal made by another person. When the person to whom the proposal is made expresses their agreement without any conditions, the proposal is accepted. Once accepted, the proposal becomes a promise, and this promise is binding and cannot be revoked.

It is important to note that an offer alone does not create any legal obligation. However, when the offer is accepted, it establishes a legal obligation for both parties involved. Once the acceptance is communicated, the offeror can no longer withdraw or revoke the offer.

For example, let’s consider a situation where X offers to buy Y’s horse for 1 lakh rupees. If Y agrees to the offer and gives their consent to sell the horse to X for the specified amount, their acceptance transforms the offer into a promise. At this point, both parties are bound by their respective obligations.
Valid acceptance: Sections 7 and 8 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872
For an acceptance to be considered valid under the Indian Contract Act of 1872, certain essential elements are specified in Sections 7 and 8 of the Act.

Section 7: Absolute Acceptance
Section 7 emphasises that an acceptance must be absolute and unqualified. It should be expressed either explicitly or implicitly unless the proposal specifies a particular acceptance manner. If the proposal states how the acceptance should be communicated, the offeree must comply with that specified method to indicate their consent.

Section 8: Acceptance by Performance
Section 8 deals with situations where an offer can be accepted without explicit communication of acceptance. According to this section, if the offeree performs the conditions mentioned in the offer or accepts the consideration for a reciprocal promise, it is considered an acceptance of the offer. In such cases, the offer is deemed accepted even if there is no explicit communication of acceptance.

These provisions in the Indian Contract Act outline the requirements for a valid acceptance. It is important to ensure that the acceptance is absolute and unqualified and to be aware of circumstances where acceptance can be implied through performance rather than explicit communication.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

"Every person is competent to contract who has the legal capacity to do so which includes the age of majority according to the law, soundness of mind and is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject.

This ensures that the contract is not voidable or unenforceable due to the incapacity of one or more parties involved.
Who are competent to Contract?
According to Sections 11 and 12 Indian Contract Act, the following persons are competent to contract:

Every person who has attained the age of majority: According to Section 11, any person who has attained the age of 18 years is competent to contract.
Persons who are of sound mind: According to Section 12, a person who is of sound mind is competent to contract. A person who is of unsound mind at the time of making the contract is not competent to contract.
Persons who are not disqualified by law: According to Section 11, any person who is not disqualified by law is competent to contract.
Agreement with a Minor
Who is a minor?
According to Section 3 of the Indian Majority Act, 1875, a person below 18 years of age is a minor. However, a person to whom a guardian has been appointed by the court for their person or property remains a minor until the age of 21 years. 

Nature of agreement with minor
Neither Section 10 nor 11 makes it clear whether the agreement entered by the minor is voidable at his option or altogether void. This led to a controversy about the nature of the minor’s agreement, which was resolved in the Privy Council decision in Mohiri Bibi v. Dharmodas Ghosh.

The Privy Council decision in Mohiri Bibi v. Dharmodas Ghosh held that a minor’s agreement is totally null and void from the beginning, and the minor is not considered competent to contract or give any consideration.

                Legal Definition:
            </strong>
            A minor is an individual under 18 years of age, unless a
            court-appointed guardian oversees their affairs, in which case they
            remain a minor until 21 years.
        </li>
        <li>
            Competency to contract is crucial as it ensures that parties
            involved possess the necessary legal capacity to enter into a
            contract. This helps prevent agreements from being void or
            unenforceable due to incapacity issues.

"Summary of Mohiri Bibi v. Dharmodas Ghosh
The court’s decision, in this case, can be summarized as follows:
The minor’s agreement is void ab initio, meaning it is null and void and the minor is not competent to contract or give consideration.
The court did not address the applicability of the doctrine of estoppel against minors but stated that it would not apply in this case as the plaintiff was aware of the minor’s minority.
Section 64 does not apply as it applies to voidable contracts and the minor’s agreement is void ab initio. Section 65 is also inapplicable as it deals with subsequent voidness or agreements discovered to be void, while the minor is not competent to contract.
Under Section 41 of the Specific Relief Act, the court has the discretion to order compensation if justice requires it. However, in this case, the court did not order compensation as the plaintiff was aware of the minor’s minority.
The effect of a minor’s agreement 
a) No estoppel against a minor 
The law of estoppel does not apply against a minor. The minor can plead minority as a defence to avoid liability under the agreement, even if they falsely stated that they had attained the age of majority at the time of making the agreement. The principle that a minor’s agreement is void ab initio overrides the procedural principle of estoppel. 

Furthermore, there can be no estoppel where both parties know the truth of the matter. Therefore, a false representation made to a person who knows it to be false is not fraud that takes away the privilege of infancy.

b) No liability in contract or tort arising out of contract 
In general, a contract cannot be converted into a tort to enable a party to sue a minor. If the tort is directly connected with the contract and is a means of affecting it and is a parcel of the same transaction, the minor is not liable in tort. However, where the tort is independent of the contract, the mere fact that a contract is also involved will not absolve the minor from liability. 

For example, in Burnard v. Haggis, the minor was held liable when they borrowed a mare for riding, but their friend jumped and killed her. Similarly, in Ballet v. Mingay, a minor was held liable for the tort of detenu for failing to return hired instruments to a friend. However, in Jennings v. Rundall, the minor was not held liable when they hired a horse for a short journey but took it on a longer journey, which resulted in injury to the horse. The reason was that the action was founded in a contract, and the plaintiff could not turn what was essentially a claim in the contract into a claim in tort.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

        Overview of Mohiri Bibi v. Dharmodas Ghosh Case
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The court's ruling in the Mohiri Bibi v. Dharmodas Ghosh case can be
            succinctly summarized as follows:
        </li>
        <li>
            When a minor enters into an agreement, it is considered void from
            the beginning. This means that the contract is null and void, as
            minors are not legally capable of entering into a contract or
            providing consideration.
        </li>
        <li>
            The court did not delve into the application of the doctrine of
            estoppel concerning minors. It clarified that estoppel would not be
            applicable in this particular case because the plaintiff was aware
            of the minor's legal incapacity due to their age.
        </li>
        <li>
            Section 64, which pertains to voidable contracts, is not relevant in
            this scenario since the minor's agreement is void ab initio.
            Similarly, Section 65, dealing with subsequent voidness or
            agreements found to be void, does not apply because minors lack the
            capacity to contract.
        </li>
        <li>
            According to Section 41 of the Specific Relief Act, the court has
            the authority to award compensation if deemed just. However, in this
            instance, the court decided against ordering compensation because
            the plaintiff was fully aware of the minor's legal status.

            a. No Estoppel Against a Minor:
        </strong>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Estoppel does not apply to minors, who can use their age as a
            defense to avoid liability in agreements. Even if a minor falsely
            claims to be of legal age during the agreement, the agreement is
            void from the beginning, which is more important than estoppel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Estoppel cannot be invoked when both parties are aware of the true
            facts. Therefore, misleading a person who knows the truth does not
            remove the minor's protection under infancy.

            b. No Liability in Contract or Tort Arising out of Contract:

    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In general, a minor cannot be sued in tort based on a contract. If
            the tort is closely related to the contract and is part of the same
            transaction, the minor is not liable.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, if the tort is separate from the contract, just involving a
            contract does not release the minor from liability.
        </li>
        <li>
            For instance, in cases like Burnard v. Haggis and Ballet v. Mingay,
            minors were found liable for torts related to contracts. On the
            contrary, in Jennings v. Rundall, the minor was not liable as the
            claim was essentially contractual, not tortious.
        </li>
    </ul>

"Doctrine of Restitution
The Specific Relief Act, 1877 was amended to include Section 33, which contains the principle of compensation. The rule has been finally settled as follows:

a) If a minor brings a suit to cancel an instrument, the Court may, at its discretion, ask the minor to compensate for the benefits accrued to him. b) If the minor is a defendant and resists enforcement of the suit based on their minority, the Court may, at its discretion, ask the minor to restore the benefits they have received under the instrument to the other party.

Section 33 – Power to require benefit to be restored or compensation to be made when an instrument is cancelled or successfully resisted as being void or voidable:

(1) If a court cancels an instrument, it may require the party receiving relief to restore any benefit received from the other party and make any compensation that justice requires.

(2) If a defendant successfully resists a suit:

(a) because the instrument is voidable, and the defendant has received a benefit from the other party under the instrument, the court may require the defendant to restore the benefit to that party or compensate for it;

(b) because the agreement is void due to the defendant’s incompetence to contract under Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and

(c) the defendant has received a benefit under the agreement from the other party, the court may require the defendant to restore the benefit to that party to the extent to which the defendant or their estate has benefited.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

"Contracts that are Beneficial to the Minor
When a minor provides consideration to the other party, they are fully capable of enforcing the contract and receiving its benefits. However, if consideration is yet to be provided, the contract is not actionable.

1. Contract of Service and Apprenticeship
In England, an infant is bound by any contract for service or apprenticeship as these contracts are beneficial to them in terms of earning a livelihood. In India, only a contract for apprenticeship is binding under the Indian Apprenticeship Act, 1960, while a contract for service is not binding on a minor.

For instance, in the case of Raj Pani v. Prem Adib, a film producer had allotted the role of an actress in a particular film to a minor plaintiff through an agreement made with her father. However, the defendant later allotted the role to another artist and terminated the contract with the plaintiff’s father. The Bombay High Court held that neither the plaintiff nor her father could have sued on the promise.

If the contract was with the plaintiff, it was null and void as she was a minor. If the contract was with her father, it was void as there was no consideration. The promise of a minor girl to serve cannot furnish any consideration for the defendant’s promise to pay her a salary, as it is not enforceable against her.

2. Contract of Marriage
A minor can enforce a contract of marriage against the other contracting party, but the contract cannot be enforced against the minor. This is because the contract of marriage is considered beneficial to the minor.

3. Minor and Partnership
According to Section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, all parties to a partnership agreement must have the capacity to contract. As a minor does not have the capacity to contract, they cannot become a party to a partnership agreement.

A minor cannot ratify a contract made during their minority after they attain majority. This is because ratification relates back to the date on which the contract was made, and a contract that was void at that time cannot be validated by subsequent ratification unless a fresh consideration is provided.

However, if a consideration was given for the contract during the minority, and a fresh or the rest of the consideration is furnished after attaining the majority, a promise to pay both can become binding upon the minor upon attaining the majority, as held in the case of Kundan Bibi v. Shri Narayan.

In the case of Suraj Narayan v. Sukhu Ahir, ILR (1928) 51 All 164, a minor borrowed a sum of money and executed a simple bond for it. After attaining the majority, the minor executed a second bond for the original loan amount plus interest. It was held by a majority of two against one that the suit upon the second bond was not maintainable as the second bond was without consideration and did not come under Section 25(2) of the Indian Contract Act.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

            contract, they cannot be parties to a partnership agreement.

        <li>
            Additionally, a minor cannot ratify a contract made during their
            minority once they reach the age of majority. This is because
            ratification pertains to the date of the contract's formation, and a
            contract that was void at that time cannot be validated through
            subsequent ratification unless fresh consideration is provided.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, if consideration was given for the contract during the
            minority, and either fresh consideration or the remainder of the
            consideration is furnished after attaining majority, a promise to
            pay both can bind the minor upon reaching majority. This principle
            was established in the case of Kundan Bibi v. Shri Narayan.

            a minor borrowed a sum of money and executed a simple bond for it.
            After attaining majority, the minor executed a second bond for the
            original loan amount plus interest. The court majority held that the
            suit based on the second bond was not maintainable because the
            second bond lacked consideration and did not fall under Section
            25(2) of the Indian Contract Act.

"Minor’s Liability for Necessaries [Section 68]
Under Section 68 of the Indian Contract Act, reimbursement is permitted to the person who supplies necessaries to a minor. This is because it is deemed to be a quasi-contractual obligation.

Reimbursement is allowed if the following conditions are satisfied:

Necessaries are supplied
To a person who is incapable of making a contract, or
To the dependants of such a person
Reimbursement is permitted from the estate of such a person.
The goods supplied must be necessary for the minor’s station in life, and the minor must not already have a sufficient supply of such necessities.

The term ‘necessaries’ is not defined in the Indian Contract Act. It is therefore necessary to turn to judicial decisions for guidance. In Chappell v Cooper [(1844) 13 M and W 252] (Alderson B), it was held that “things necessary are those without which an individual can’t reasonably exist.

In the first place, it comprises food, clothes, and shelter. Then, since the proper cultivation of the mind is as expedient as the support needed for the growth of the body, education and instruction in art and trade, etc., may be necessary also.” Thus, what constitutes ‘necessaries’ is a relative thing and depends on the circumstances of the minor’s life.

To render a minor’s estate liable for necessaries, two conditions must be satisfied:

The contract must be for goods reasonably necessary for the minor’s support in his or her station in life, and
The minor must not already have a sufficient supply of these necessities.
The nature of the liability for necessaries supplied to a minor or his or her dependents is a subject of debate. According to one theory, the liability is quasi-contractual because it does not depend on the minor’s consent but arises because the necessaries have been supplied. This is supported by the fact that minors and persons of unsound minds are incapable of giving consent. The liability, therefore, arises because of the supply of the necessaries (Nash v. Inman).


In India, since this subject has been dealt with in the chapter of quasi-contract and the liability is clearly mentioned to rest upon the minor’s estate and not on the minor, it has a very little contractual element.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

    <ul>
        <li>
            According to Section 68 of the Indian Contract Act, individuals who
            supply necessaries to a minor can seek reimbursement because it is
            considered a quasi-contractual obligation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reimbursement is permissible under the following conditions:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The goods supplied must be necessary for the minor's station
                    in life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The minor must not already possess an adequate supply of
                    these necessities.

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The term 'necessaries' is not explicitly defined in the Indian
            Contract Act. Judicial interpretations, such as in Chappell v
            Cooper, suggest that necessaries are items crucial for an
            individual's existence like food, clothes, shelter, education, and
            training.
        </li>
        <li>
            For a minor's estate to be held liable for necessaries:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The goods must be reasonably essential for the minor's
                    support given their social standing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The minor should lack a sufficient supply of these essential
                    items.

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Debates exist regarding the nature of liability for necessaries
            provided to a minor or their dependents. Some argue it is
            quasi-contractual as it is not dependent on the minor's consent but
            on the supply of necessaries.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the Indian context, the liability for necessaries rests on the
            minor's estate, not the minor, suggesting a minimal contractual
            aspect.

"Persons of unsound mind
In India, Section 12 of the ICA governs the contractual liability of persons of unsound mind, including those who are drunk. Under this section, a person is considered to be of sound mind if they are capable of understanding and forming a rational judgment about the contract’s effect on their interests at the time of making it.

If a person is usually of unsound mind, they can make a contract when they are of sound mind, but if they are usually of sound mind, they cannot enter into a contract when they are of unsound mind.

The important factor is whether the person was capable of forming a judgment that entering into the contract was in their interest at the time of making the contract.

The Section reads as:

“12. A person is said to be of sound mind for the purpose of making a contract if, at the time when he makes it, he is capable of understanding it and of forming a rational judgment as to its effect upon his interests.
A person who is usually of unsound mind, but occasionally of sound mind, may make a contract when he is of sound mind.

A person who is usually of sound mind, but occasionally of unsound mind, may not make a contract when he is of unsound mind.


Illustrations

(a) A patient in a lunatic asylum, who is at intervals of sound mind, may contract during those intervals.

(b) A sane man, who is delirious from fever or who is so drunk that he cannot understand the terms of a contract or form a rational judgment as to its effect on his interests, cannot contract whilst such delirium or drunkenness lasts.”

In Inder Singh v. Parmeshwar Dhari Singh, it was held that this is the real import of the provisions regarding persons of unsound mind.

Two case laws have interpreted the provisions of Section 12.


In Rajinder Kaur v. Mangal Singh, it was held that it is the court’s duty to ultimately record its opinion on whether a person is lunatic or of unsound mind, and while the expert’s opinion should be given weight, the court should not give up its duty to decide. In Lingaraj v. Parvathi, it was observed that the court must distinguish between the mere weakness of intellect and lunacy.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

"Persons disqualified by law
According to Section 11, any person who is not disqualified by law is competent to contract.

Alien enemy
Under the Indian Contract Act, an alien enemy is a citizen of a country that India is at war with. Any contracts made during the war period with an alien enemy are void. An Indian citizen residing in an alien enemy’s territory is also treated as an alien enemy under contract law. Contracts made before the war period either get dissolved if they are against public policy or remain suspended and are revived after the war is over, provided they are not barred by limitation.

Illustration: A citizen of country X orders goods from a citizen of country Y. The goods are shipped, but before they could reach Y, country X declares war on country Y. The contract between A and B becomes void.

Convicts
A convict cannot enter into a contract while serving their sentence. However, they regain their capacity to enter into a contract upon completion of their sentence.

Illustration: A is serving their sentence in jail. Any contract signed by them during this period is void.

Insolvent
An insolvent is a person who has been declared bankrupt or against whom insolvency proceedings have been filed in court. Since the person does not have any power over their assets, they cannot enter into contracts concerning their property.

Illustration: A enters into a contract for the sale of goods with B. Before the sale takes place, an insolvency suit is filed against A. A sells the goods to B during the pendency of the insolvency proceedings. The contract is void.

Foreign sovereign
Diplomats and ambassadors of foreign countries enjoy contractual immunity in India. One cannot sue them in Indian courts unless they submit themselves to the jurisdiction of Indian courts. Additionally, sanction from the central government is also required in such cases. However, the foreign sovereign has the authority to enforce contracts against the third person in Indian courts.

"WHY DO WE NEED A CONSTITUTION?
 What is a constitution? What are its functions? What role does it
 perform for a society? How does a constitution relate to our daily
 existence? Answering these questions is not as difficult as you might
 think.

 Imagine yourself to be a member of a
 reasonably large group. Further imagine that
 this group has the following characteristics.
 The members of this group are diverse in
 various ways. They have different religious
 allegiances: some are Hindus, some are
 Muslims, some Christians and some perhaps
 profess no religion at all. They are also varied
 in many different respects: they
 pursue different professions, have
 different abilities, have different
 hobbies, different tastes in

 village or town or colony too?

 people of my village.
 everything from films to books.
 Some are rich and some are poor.
 Some are old, some young.
 Imagine further that members of this group are likely to
 have disputes over various aspects of life: How much
 property should one be allowed to own?  Should it be
 compulsory that every child be sent to school or should
 the parents be allowed to decide? How much should this
 group spend on its safety and security? Or should it build
 more parks instead? Should the group be allowed to
 discriminate against some of its members?  Every question
 will elicit a variety of answers from different people. But,

 for all their diversity, this group has to live together. They are
 dependent upon each other in various ways. They require the
 cooperation of each other. What will enable the group to live together
 peacefully?

Chapter 1: Constitution: Why and How?
 One may say that perhaps members of this group can live together
 if they can agree on some basic rules. Why will the group need certain
 basic rules? Think of what would happen in the absence of some
 basic rules. Every individual would be insecure simply because they
 would not know what members of this group could do to each other,
 who could claim rights over what. Any group will need some basic
 rules that are publicly promulgated and known to all members of
 that group to achieve a minimal degree of coordination. But these
 rules must not only be known, they must also be enforceable.  If
 citizens have no assurance that others will follow these rules, they
 will themselves have no reason to follow these rules. Saying that the
 rules are legally enforceable gives an assurance to everybody that
 others will follow these, for if they do not do so, they will be punished.
 The first function of a constitution is to provide a set of
 basic rules that allow for minimal coordination amongst
 members of a society",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"    <h2>

            guiding societal goals. Born from the struggle for India's
            independence, it balances power, prevents misuse, and reflects the
            collective identity and aspirations of the people, embodying the

" Specification of decision making powers
 A constitution is a body of fundamental principles according to which
 a state is constituted or governed. But what should these
 fundamental rules be? And what makes them fundamental? Well,
 the first question you will have to decide is who gets to decide what
 the laws governing the society should be? You may want rule X, but
 others may want rule Y. How do we decide whose rules or preferences
 should govern us? You may think the rules you want everyone to
 live by are the best; but others think that their rules are the best.
 How do we resolve this dispute? So even before you decide what
 rules should govern this group you have to decide: Who gets to
 decide?
 The constitution has to provide an answer to this question. It
 specifies the basic allocation of power in a society. It decides who
 gets to decide what the laws will be. In principle, this question, who
 gets to decide, can be answered in many ways: in a monarchical
 constitution, a monarch decides; in some constitutions like the old
 Soviet Union, one single party was given the power to decide. But in
 democratic constitutions, broadly speaking, the people get to decide.
 But this matter is not so simple. Because even if you answer that the
 people should decide, it will not answer the question: how should
 the people decide? For something to be law, should everyone agree
 4
 to it? Should  the people directly vote on each matter as the ancient
 Greeks did? Or should the people express their preferences by electing
 representatives? But if the people act through their representatives,
 how should these representatives be elected? How many should there
 be?
 In the Indian Constitution for example, it is specified that in most
 instances, Parliament gets to decide laws and policies, and that
 Parliament itself be organised in a particular manner. Before
 identifying what the law in any given society is, you have to identify

 who has the authority to enact it. If Parliament has the authority to
 enact laws,  there must be a law that bestows this authority on
 Parliament  in the first
 place. This is the function
 of the constitution. It is an
 authority that constitutes

 place.

" Limitations on the
 powers of government

 But this is clearly not
 enough. Suppose you
 decided who had the
 authority to make
 decisions. But then this
 authority passed laws that
 you thought were patently
 unfair. It prohibited you
 from practising your
 religion for instance. Or it
 enjoined that clothes of a
 certain colour were
 prohibited, or that you
 were not free to sing certain songs or that people who belonged to a
 particular group (caste or religion) would always have to serve others
 and would not be allowed to retain any property. Or that government
 could arbitrarily arrest someone, or that only people of a certain skin
 colour would be allowed to draw water from wells. You would obviously
 think these laws were unjust and unfair. And even though they were

 cartoonist’s impression of this attempt. Does this

 passed by a government that had come into existence based
on certain procedures there would be something
 obviously unjust about that government enacting these
 laws.
 So the third function of a constitution is to set
 some limits on what a government can  impose on
 its citizens. These limits are fundamental in the
 sense that government may never trespass them.
 Constitutions limit the power of government in many
 ways. The most common way of limiting the power of
 government is to specify certain fundamental rights that
 all of us possess as citizens and which no government
 can ever be allowed to violate.  The exact content and
 interpretation of these rights varies from constitution to
 constitution. But most constitutions will protect a basic
 cluster of rights. Citizens will be protected from being
 arrested arbitrarily and for no reason. This is one basic
 limitation upon the power of government. Citizens will
 normally have the right to some basic liberties: to freedom
 of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of association,
 freedom to conduct a trade or business  etc. In practice,
 these rights can be limited  during times of national
 emergency and the constitution specifies the
 circumstances under which these rights may be
 withdrawn.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"  <h3>

"Aspirations and goals of a society
 Most of the older constitutions limited themselves largely
 to allocating decision-making power and setting some
 limits to government power. But many twentieth century
 constitutions, of which the Indian Constitution is the
 finest example, also provide an enabling framework for
 the government to do certain positive things, to express
 the aspirations and goals of society. The Indian
 Constitution was particularly innovative in this respect.
 Societies with deep entrenched inequalities of various
 kinds, will not only have to set limits on the power of
 government, they will also have to enable and empower
 the government to take positive measures to overcome
 forms of inequality or deprivation.
 For example, India aspires to be a society that is free of caste
 discrimination. If this is our society’s aspiration, the government will
 have to be enabled or empowered to take all the necessary steps to
 achieve this goal. In a country like South Africa, which had a deep
 history of racial discrimination, its new constitution had to enable
 the government to end racial discrimination. More positively, a
 constitution may enshrine the aspirations of a society. The framers
 of the Indian Constitution, for example, thought that each
 individual in society should have all that is necessary for them to
 lead a life of minimal dignity and social self-respect — minimum
 material well-being, education etc. The Indian Constitution
 enables the government to take positive welfare measures
 some of which are legally enforceable. As we go on studying
 the Indian Constitution, we shall find that such enabling
 provisions have the support of the Preamble to our
 Constitution, and these provisions are found in the section
 on Fundamental Rights. The Directive Principles of State
 of Policy also enjoin government to fulfil certain
 aspirations of the people.
 The fourth function of a constitution is to enable
 the government to fulfil the aspirations of a society
 and create conditions for a just society.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"    <h3>

            all citizens.
        </li>
    </ul>"
"Fundamental identity of a people
 Finally, and perhaps even most importantly, a
 constitution expresses the fundamental identity of a
 people.
 This means the people as a collective entity come
 into being only through the basic constitution. It is
 by  agreeing to a basic set of norms about how  one
 should be governed, and who should be governed that
 one forms a collective identity.  One has many sets
 of identities that exist prior to a constitution. But  by
 agreeing to certain basic norms and principles  one constitutes  one’s
 basic political identity. Second, constitutional norms are the overarching
 framework within which one pursues individual aspirations, goals and
 freedoms. The constitution sets authoritative constraints upon what  one
 may or may not do. It defines the fundamental values that we may not
 trespass. So the constitution also gives one a moral identity.  Third and
 finally, it may be the case that many basic political and moral values are
 now shared across different constitutional traditions.
 If  one looks at constitutions around the world, they differ in many
 respects — in the form of government they enjoin in many procedural
 details. But they also share a
 good deal. Most modern
 constitutions create a form of
 government that is democratic
 in some respects, most claim
 to protect certain basic rights.
 But constitutions are different
 in the way they embody
 conceptions of national
 identity. Most nations are an
 amalgamation of a complex
 set of historical traditions;
 they weave together the
 diverse groups that reside
 within the nation in different
 ways. For example, German
 identity was constituted by
 being ethnically German.
 The constitution gave
 expression to this identity.
 The Indian Constitution, on
 the other hand, does not
 make ethnic identity a
 criterion for citizenship.
 Different nations embody
 different conceptions of
 what the relationship
between the different regions of a nation and the central government
 should be. This relationship constitutes the national identity of a
 country",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h3>

" THE AUTHORITY OF A CONSTITUTION
 We have outlined some of the functions a constitution performs. These
 functions explain why most societies have a constitution. But there
 are three further questions we can ask about constitutions:
 a) What is  a constitution?
 b) How effective is a constitution?
 c) Is  a constitution just?
 In most countries, ‘Constitution’ is a compact
 document that comprises a number of articles about the
 state, specifying how the state is to be constituted and
 what norms it should follow. When we ask for the
 constitution of a country we are usually referring to this
 document. But some countries, the United Kingdom for
 instance, do not have one single document that can be
 called the Constitution. Rather they have a series of
 documents and decisions that, taken collectively, are
 referred to as the constitution. So, we can say that
 constitution is the document or set of documents that
 seeks to perform the functions that we mentioned above.
 But many constitutions around the world exist only
 on paper; they are mere words existing on a parchment.
 The crucial question is: how effective is a constitution?
 What makes it effective? What ensures that it has a real
 impact on the lives of people? Making a constitution
 effective depends upon  many factors.
 Mode of promulgation
 This refers to how a constitution comes into being. Who
 crafted the constitution and how much authority did they
 have? In many countries constitutions remain defunct
 because they are crafted by military leaders or leaders
 who are not popular and do not have the ability to carry
 the people with them. The most successful constitutions,
 like India, South Africa and the United States, are
 constitutions which  were created in the aftermath of
 popular national movements. Although India’s
 Constitution was formally created by a Constituent
 Assembly between December 1946 and November
 1949, it drew upon a long history of the nationalist
 movement that had a remarkable ability to take along
 different sections of Indian society together. The
 Constitution drew enormous legitimacy from the
 fact that it was drawn up by people
 who enjoyed immense public
 credibility, who had the capacity
 to negotiate and command the
 respect of a wide cross-section of
 society, and who were able to
 convince the people that the
 constitution was not an instrument
 for the aggrandisement of their
 personal power. The final
 document reflected the broad
 national consensus at the time.
 Some countries have subjected
 their constitution to a full-fledged
 referendum, where all the people
 vote on the desirability of a
 constitution. The Indian
 Constitution was never subjected
 to such a referendum, but
 nevertheless carried enormous
 public authority, because it had
 the consensus and backing of
 leaders who were themselves
 popular. Although the
 Constitution itself was not
 subjected to a referendum, the
 people adopted it as their own by
 abiding by its provisions.
 Therefore, the authority of people
 who enact the constitution helps
 determine in part its prospects for
 success.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

" The substantive provisions of a
 constitution
 It is the hallmark of a successful
 constitution that it gives everyone
 in society some reason to go along
 with its provisions. A constitution
 that, for instance, allowed permanent majorities to oppress minority
 groups within society would give minorities no reason to go along
 with the provision of the constitution. Or a constitution that
 systematically privileged some members at the expense of others, or
 that systematically entrenched the power of small groups in society,
 would cease to command allegiance. If any group feels their identity
 is being stifled, they will have no reason to abide by the constitution.
 No constitution by itself achieves perfect justice. But it has to convince
 people that it provides the framework for pursuing basic justice.
 Do this thought experiment. Ask yourself this question: What
 would be the content of some basic rules in society, such that they
 gave everyone a reason to go along with them?
 The more a constitution preserves the freedom and equality of
 all its members, the more likely it is to succeed. Does the Indian
 Constitution, broadly speaking, give everyone a reason to go along
 with its broad outlines? After studying this book, one should be
 able to answer this question in the affirmative",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

" Balanced institutional design
 Constitutions are often subverted, not by the people, but by small
 groups, who wish to enhance their own power. Well crafted
 constitutions fragment power in society intelligently so that no single
 group can subvert the constitution. One way of such intelligent
 designing of a constitution is to ensure that no single institution
 acquires monopoly of power. This is often done by fragmenting power
 across different institutions. The Indian Constitution, for example,
 horizontally fragments power across different institutions like the
 Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary and even independent
 statutory bodies like the Election Commission. This ensures that
 even if one institution wants to subvert the Constitution, others can
 check its transgressions. An intelligent system of checks and
 balances has facilitated the success of the Indian Constitution.
 Another important aspect of intelligent institutional design is:
 that a constitution must strike the right balance between certain
 values, norms and procedures as authoritative, and at the same
 time allow enough flexibility in its operations to adapt to changing
 needs and circumstances. Too rigid a constitution is likely to break
 under the weight of change; a constitution that is, on the other
 hand, too flexible, will give no security,
 predictability or identity to a people.
 Successful constitutions strike the right
 balance between preserving core values and
 adapting them to new circumstances. You
 will notice the wisdom of makers of the
 Indian Constitution  in the chapter on the
 Constitution as a living document (Chapter
 9). The Indian Constitution is described as
 ‘a living’ document.  By striking a balance
 between the possibility to change the
 provisions and the limits on such changes,
 the Constitution has ensured that it will
 survive as a document respected by people.
 This arrangement also ensures that no
 section or group can, on its own, subvert
 the Constitution.
 Therefore in determining whether a
 constitution has authority you can ask
 yourself three questions:
 ± Were the people who enacted the
 constitution credible?  This question
 will be answered in the remaining part
 of this chapter.
 ± Secondly, did the constitution ensure
 that power was intelligently organised so that it was not easy for
 any group to subvert the constitution? And, most importantly,
 does the constitution give everyone some reason to go along with
 it? Most of this book is about this question.
 ± Also, is the constitution the locus of people’s hopes and
 aspiration? The ability of the constitution to command voluntary
 allegiance of the people depends to a certain extent upon whether
 the constitution is just. What are the principles of justice
 underlying the Indian Constitution? The last chapter of this book
 will answer this question.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h3>

"How was the Indian Constitution made?
 Let us find out how the Indian Constitution was made. Formally, the
 Constitution was made by the Constituent Assembly which had been
 elected for undivided India. It held its first sitting on
 9 December1946 and reassembled as Constituent Assembly for divided
 India on 14 August 1947. Its members were chosen by indirect election
 by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies that had been
 established  under the Government of India Act, 1935. The Constituent
 Assembly was composed roughly along the lines suggested by the
 plan proposed by the committee of the British cabinet, known as the
 Cabinet Mission.  According to this plan:
 Each Province and each Princely State or group of States were
 allotted seats proportional to their respective population roughly
 in the ratio of 1:10,00,000. As a result the Provinces (that were
 under direct British rule) were to elect 292 members while the
 Princely States were allotted a minimum of 93 seats.
 The seats in each Province were distributed among the three main
 communities, Muslims, Sikhs and general, in proportion to their
 respective populations.
 Members of each community in the Provincial Legislative
 Assembly elected their own representatives by the method of
 proportional representation with single transferable vote.
 The method of selection in the case of representatives of Princely
 States was to be determined by consultation.
 The previous section  discusses the three factors that
 make a constitution effective and respectable. How far
 does the Indian Constitution pass this test?",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

"Composition of the Constituent Assembly
As a consequence of the Partition under the plan of
 3 June 1947 those members who were elected from
 territories which fell under Pakistan ceased to be
 members of the Constituent Assembly. The number of
 members in the Assembly was reduced to 299. The
 Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949. 284
 members were actually present on 24 January 1950 and
 appended their signature to the Constitution as finally
 passed. The Constitution came into force on 26 January
 1950. The Constitution was thus framed against the
 backdrop of the horrendous violence that the Partition
 unleashed on the subcontinent. But it is a tribute to the
 fortitude of the framers that they were not only able to
 draft a constitution under immense pressure, but also
 learnt the right lessons from the  unimaginable violence
 that accompanied the Partition. The Constitution was
 committed to a new conception of citizenship, where not
 only would minorities be secure, but religious identity
 would have no bearing on citizenship rights.
 But this account of the composition of the Constituent
 Assembly that drafted the Constitution touches upon only
 the surface of how our Constitution was made. Although,
 the members of the Assembly were not elected by
 universal suffrage, there was a serious attempt to make
 the Assembly a representative body. Members of all
 religions were given representation under the scheme
 described above; in addition, the Assembly had twenty
eight members from the Scheduled Castes. In terms of
 political parties, the Congress dominated the Assembly
 occupying as many as eighty-two per cent of the seats in
 the Assembly after the Partition. The Congress itself was
 such a diverse party that it managed to accommodate
 almost all shades of opinion within it",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

" The Principle of Deliberation
 The authority of the Constituent Assembly does not come only from
 the fact that it was broadly, though not perfectly, representative. It
 comes from the procedures it adopted to frame the Constitution and
 the values its members brought to their deliberations. While in any
 assembly that claims to be representative, it is desirable that diverse
 sections of society participate, it is equally important that they
 participate not only as representatives of their own identity or
 community. Each member deliberated upon the Constitution with
 the interests of the whole nation in mind. There were often
 disagreements amongst members, but few of these disagreements
 could be traced to members protecting their own interests.
 There were legitimate differences of principle. And the differences
 were many: should India adopt a centralised or decentralised system
 of government? What should be the relations between the States and
 the centre? What should be the powers of the judiciary? Should the
 Constitution protect property rights? Almost every issue that lies at
 the foundation of a modern state was discussed with great
 sophistication. Only one provision of the Constitution was passed
 without virtually any debate: the introduction of universal suffrage
 (meaning that all citizens reaching a certain age, would be entitled to
 be voters irrespective of religion, caste, education, gender or income).
 So, while the members felt no need at all to discuss the issue of who
 should have the right to vote, every other matter was seriously
 discussed and debated. Nothing can be a better testament to the
 democratic commitment of this Assembly.
 The Constitution drew its authority from the fact that members
 of the Constituent Assembly engaged in what one might call public
 reason. The members of the Assembly placed a great emphasis on
 discussion and reasoned argument. They did not simply advance
 their own interests, but gave principled reasons to other members
 for their positions. The very act of giving reasons to others makes
 you move away from simply a narrow consideration of your own
 interest because you have to give reasons to others to make them go
 along with your view point. The voluminous debates in the
 Constituent Assembly, where each clause of the Constitution was
 subjected to scrutiny and debate, is a tribute to public reason at its
 best. These debates deserved to be memorialised as one of the most
 significant chapters in the history of constitution making, equal in
 importance to the French and American revolutions.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h2>

" Procedures
 The importance of public reason
 was emphasised in the mundane
 procedures of the Assembly as
 well. The Constituent Assembly
 had eight major Committees on
 different subjects. Usually,
 Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra
 Prasad, Sardar Patel or B.R.
 Ambedkar chaired these
 Committees. These were not men
 who agreed with each other on many
 things. Ambedkar had been a bitter
 critic of the Congress and Gandhi,
 accusing them of not doing enough
 for the upliftment of Scheduled
 Castes. Patel and Nehru disagreed
 on many issues. Nevertheless, they
 all worked together. Each
 Committee usually drafted
 particular provisions of the
 Constitution which were then
 subjected to debate by the entire
 Assembly. Usually an attempt was
 made to reach a consensus  with the
 belief that provisions agreed to by
 all, would not be detrimental to any
 particular interests. Some
 provisions were subject to the vote.
 But in each instance every single
 argument, query or concern was
 responded to with great care and
in writing. The Assembly met for one hundred and sixty
 six days, spread over two years and eleven months. Its
 sessions were open to the press and the public alike.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h2>

"Inheritance of the nationalist movement
 But no constitution is simply a product of the Assembly
 that produces it. An Assembly as diverse as the
 Constituent Assembly of India could not have functioned
 if there was no background consensus on the main
 principles the Constitution should enshrine. These
 principles were forged during the long struggle for
 freedom. In a way, the Constituent Assembly was giving
 concrete shape and form to the principles it had  inherited
 from the nationalist movement. For decades preceding
 the promulgation of the Constitution, the nationalist
 movement had debated many questions that were
 relevant to the making of the constitution — the shape
 and form of government India should have, the values it
 should uphold, the inequalities it should overcome.
 Answers forged in those debates were given their final
 form in the Constitution.
 Perhaps the best summary of the principles that the
 nationalist movement brought to the Constituent
 Assembly is the Objective Resolution (the resolution that
 defined the aims of the Assembly) moved by Nehru in
 1946. This resolution encapsulated the aspirations and
 values behind the Constitution. What the previous section
 terms as substantive provisions of the constitution  is
 inspired by and summed up by the values incorporated
 in the Objectives Resolution. Based on this resolution,
 our Constitution gave institutional expression to these
 fundamental commitments: equality, liberty, democracy,
 sovereignty and a cosmopolitan identity. Thus, our
 Constitution is not merely a maze of rules and procedures,
 but a moral commitment to establish a government that
 will fulfil the many promises that the nationalist movement
 held before the people",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h2>

" Institutional arrangements
The third factor ensuring effectiveness of a constitution is a balanced
 arrangement of the institutions of government. The basic principle is
 that government must be democratic and committed to the welfare
 of the people. The Constituent Assembly spent a lot of time on
 evolving the right balance among the various institutions like the
 executive, the legislature and the judiciary. This led to the
 adoption of the parliamentary form and the federal arrangement,
 which would distribute governmental powers between the  legislature and the executive on the one hand and
 between the States and the central government on the
 other hand.
 While evolving the most balanced governmental
 arrangements, the makers of our Constitution did not
 hesitate to learn from experiments and experiences of
 other countries. Thus, the framers of the Constitution
 were not averse to borrowing from other constitutional
 traditions. Indeed, it is a testament to their wide learning
 that they could lay their hands upon any intellectual
 argument, or historical example that was necessary for
 fulfilling the task at hand. So they borrowed a number of
 provisions from different countries.
 But borrowing these ideas was not slavish imitation.
 Far from it. Each provision of the Constitution had to be
 defended on grounds that it was suited to Indian
 problems and aspirations. India was extremely lucky to
 have an Assembly that instead of being parochial in its
 outlook could take the best available everywhere in the
 world and make it their own",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h2>

" Conclusion
 It is a tribute to the wisdom and foresight of the makers of the
 Constitution that they presented to the nation a document that
 enshrined fundamental values and highest aspirations shared
 by the people. This is one of the reasons why this most intricately
 crafted document has not only survived but become a living
 reality, when so many other constitutions have perished with
 the paper they were first written on.
 India’s Constitution is a unique document which in turn
 became an exemplar for many other constitutions, most notably
 South Africa. The main purpose behind the long search that
 went on for almost three years was to strike the right balance
 so that institutions created by the Constitution would not be
 haphazard or tentative arrangements but would be able to
 accommodate the aspirations of the people of India for a long
 time to come. You will know more about these arrangements
 through the study of the remaining chapters in this book.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

                values and aspirations of society. The Indian Constitution,
                crafted with public credibility and broad consensus, provides a
                robust framework for justice, equality, and governance,

" INTRODUCTION
 This book began with a discussion
 about the interaction of the individual
 and society. We saw that each of us as
 individuals, occupies a place or
 location in society. Each one of us has
 a status and a role or roles, but these
 are not simply what we as individuals
 choose. They are not like roles a film
 actor may or may not opt to do. There
 are social institutions that constrain and
 control, punish and reward. They could
 be ‘macro’ social institutions like the
 state or  ‘micro’ ones like the family.
 Here in this chapter we are introduced
 to social institutions, and also to how
 sociology/social anthropology studies
 them. This chapter puts forth a very
 brief idea of some of the central areas
 where important social institutions are
 located namely: (i) family, marriage and
 kinship; (ii) politics; (iii) economics;
 (iv) religion; and (v) education.
 In the broadest sense, an
 institution is something that works
 according to rules established or at
 least acknowledged by law or by
 custom. And whose regular and
 continuous operation cannot be
 understood without taking those rules
 into account. Institutions impose
 constraints on individuals. They also
 provide him/her with opportunities.
 An institution can also be viewed as
 an end in itself. Indeed people have
 viewed family, religion, state or even
 education as an end in itself.
We have already seen that  there
 are conflicting and different
 understandings of concepts within
 sociology. We have also been introduced
 to the functionalist and conflict
 perspective, and seen how differently
 they saw the same thing, for instance,
 stratification or social control. Not
 surprisingly, therefore, there are
 different forms of understanding of
 social institutions as well.
 A functionalist view understands
 social institutions as a complex set of
 social norms, beliefs, values and role
 relationship that arise in response to
 the needs of society. Social institutions
 exist to satisfy social needs. Accordingly
 we find informal and formal social
 institutions in societies.  Institutions
 such as family and religion are
 examples of informal social institutions
 while law and (formal) education are
 formal social institutions.
 A conflict view holds that all
 individuals are not placed equally in
 society. All social institutions whether
 familial, religious, political, economic,
 legal or educational will operate in the
 interest of the dominant sections of
 society be it class, caste, tribe or gender.
 The dominant social section not only
 dominates political and economic
 institutions but also ensures that the
 ruling class ideas become the ruling
 ideas of a society. This is very different
 from the idea that there are general
 needs of a society.
 As you go about reading this
 chapter, see whether you can think
 of examples to show how social
 institutions constrain and also offer
 opportunities to individuals. Notice
 whether they impact different sections
 of society unequally.  For instance, we
 could ask, “How does the family
 constrain as well provide opportunities
 to men and women?” Or “How do
 political or legal institutions affect the
 privileged and dispossessed?”",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

                an entity that operates based on established rules
            </strong>
            , which can be set by law or custom. Its regular operation depends
            on adhering to these principles. Individuals are bound by these
            institutions. Institutions can also be seen as means to an end.
        </p>

        For example, the family, church, state, and education are viewed as both

            Sociological Perspectives:

        Sociological interpretations of institutions vary. The functionalist and
        conflict perspectives offer different views on social phenomena such as
        stratification and social control.

                <strong>
                    Functionalist Perspective:
                </strong>
                From this view, social institutions are seen as
                <strong>
                    complex systems of social norms
                </strong>
                , beliefs, values, and role relationships that emerge to meet
                societal needs. Societies have both formal and informal
                institutions. For instance, family and religion are considered
                informal social institutions, while law and education are formal
                social institutions.

                    Conflict Perspective:

                This perspective argues that
                <strong>
                    not all individuals are treated equally
                </strong>
                in society. Social institutions—including family, religion,
                politics, economics, law, and education—serve the interests of
                dominant groups. The dominant sector influences political and
                economic institutions and ensures that the ruling class's
                beliefs become the prevailing ideas in society.

" FAMILY, MARRIAGE AND KINSHIP
 Perhaps no other social entity appears
 more ‘natural’ than the family. Often we
 are prone to assume that all families are
 like the ones we live in. No other social
 institution appears more universal and
 unchanging. Sociology and social
 anthropology have over many decades,
 conducted field research across
 cultures to show how the institutions
 of family, marriage and kinship are
 important in all societies and yet their
 character is different in different
 societies. They have also shown how the
 family (the private sphere) is linked to
 economic, political, cultural and
 educational (the public) spheres. This
 may remind you of why there is a need
 to share and borrow from different
 disciplines, which we have discussed in
 Chapter 1.
 According to the functionalists the
 family performs important tasks, which
 contribute to society’s basic needs and
 helps perpetuate social order. The
 functionalist perspective argues that
 modern industrial societies function
 best if women look after the family and
 men earn the family livelihood. In India
 studies however suggest that families
 need not become nuclear in an
 industrial pattern of economy (Singh
 1993: 83). This is but one example to
 show how trends based on experiences
 of one society cannot necessarily be
 generalised.
 The nuclear family is seen as the
 unit best equipped to handle the
 demands of industrial society by the
 functionalists. In such a family one
 adult can work outside home while the
 second adult cares for the home and
 children. In practical terms, this
 specialisation of roles within the
 nuclear family involves the husband
 adopting the ‘instrumental’ role as
 breadwinner, and the wife assuming
 the ‘affective’, emotional role in domestic
 settings (Giddens 2001). This vision is
 questionable not just because it is
 gender unjust but because empirical
 studies across cultures and history
 show that it is untrue. Indeed, as you
 will see in the discussion on work and
 economy how in contemporary
 industries like the garment export,
 women form a large part of the labour
 force. Such a separation also suggests
 that men are necessarily the heads of
 households. This is not necessarily true
 as the box which is given below shows.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

        From this viewpoint, the family is crucial for fulfilling society’s

        </li>
    </ul>"
" Variation in Family Forms
 A central debate in India has been
 about the shift from nuclear family to
 joint families. We have already seen how
 sociology questions common sense
 impressions. The fact is that nuclear
 families have always existed in India
 particularly among deprived castes and
 classes.
 The sociologist A.M. Shah remarks
 that in post-independent India the joint
 family has steadily increased. The
 contributing factor is the increasing life
 expectancy in India according to him. It
 has increased from 32.5 – 55.4 years
 for men and from 31.7– 55.7 years for
 women during the period 1941– 50
 to 1981-85. Consequently, the
 proportion of aged people (60 years and
 above) in the total population has
 increased. “We have to ask” writes Shah:
 “in what kind of household do these
 elderly people live? I submit, most
 of them live in joint household”
 (Shah 1998).
 This again is a broad generalisation.
 But in the spirit of the sociological
 perspective, it cautions us against
 blindly believing a common sense
 impression that the joint family is fast
 eroding. And alerts us to the need for
 careful comparative and empirical
 studies.
 Studies have shown how diverse
 family forms are found in different
societies. With regard to the rule of
 residence, some societies are matrilocal
 in their marriage and family customs
 while others are patrilocal. In the first
 case, the newly married couple stays
 with the woman’s parents, whereas in
 the second case the couple lives with
 the man’s parents. A patriarchal family
 structure exists where the men
 exercise authority and dominance, and
 matriarchy where the women play a
 major role in decision-making in the
 family. While matrilineal societies exist,
 the same cannot be claimed about
 matriarchal societies",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

" Families are Linked to other Social
 Spheres and Families Change
 Often in our everyday life we look at
 the family as distinct and separate from
 other spheres such as the economic or
 political. However, as you will see for
 yourself the family, the household, its
 structure and norms are closely linked
 to the rest of society. An interesting
 example is that of the unintended
 consequences of the German uni
fication. During the post-unification
 period in the 1990s Germany
 witnessed a rapid decline in marriage
 because the new German state
 withdrew all the protection and welfare
 schemes which were provided to the
 families prior to the unification. With
 growing sense of economic insecurity
 people responded by refusing to marry.
 This can also be understood as a
 case of unintended consequence
 (Chapter 1).
 Family and kinship are thus
 subject to change and transformation
 due to macro economic processes but
 the direction of change need  not always
 be similar for all countries and regions.
 Moreover, change does not mean the
 complete erosion of previous norms and
 structure. Change and continuity
 co-exist.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h3>

" Forms of Marriage
 Marriage has a large variety of forms.
 These forms can be identified on the
 basis of the number of partners and
 rules governing who can marry whom.
 In terms of the number of partners that
 can legitimately enter into matrimony,
 we have two forms of marriage,
 namely, monogamy and polygamy.
 Monogamy restricts the individual to
 one spouse at a time. Under this
 system, at any given time a man can
 have only one wife and a woman can
 have only one husband. Even where
 polygamy is permitted, in actual
 practice, monogamy is more widely
 prevalent.
 In many societies, individuals are
 permitted to marry again, often on the
 death of the first spouse or after
 divorce. But they cannot have more
 than one spouse at one and the same
 time. Such monogamous marriages
 are termed serial monogamy.
 Remarriages on the death of a wife have
 been a norm for men for the most part.
 But as all of you are aware that the
 45
 right for upper caste Hindu widows
 was denied and that the campaign for
 widow remarriage was a major issue
 in the 19th century reform movements.
 What you are probably less aware is
 that today in modern India nearly 10
 per cent of all women and 55 per cent
 of women over fifty years are widows
 (Chen 2000:353).
 Polygamy denotes marriage to
 more than one mate at one time and
 takes the form of either: Polygyny (one
 husband with two or more wives) or
 Polyandry (one wife with two or more
 husbands). Usually where economic
 conditions are harsh, polyandry may
 be one response of society, since in
 such situations a single male cannot
 adequately support a wife and
 children. Also, extreme poverty
 conditions pressurise a group to limit
 its population.
 The Matter of Arranging Marriages:
 Rules and Prescriptions
 In some societies, the decisions
 regarding mate selection are made
 by parents/relatives; in some other
 societies individuals are relatively free
 to choose their own mates.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

        can have only one wife, and a woman can have only one husband at any
        given time.
        <strong>
            2. Polygamy:
        </strong>
        Polygamy allows marriage to more than one partner simultaneously and
        includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Polygyny:
            </strong>
            One husband with multiple wives.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Polyandry:
            </strong>
            One wife with multiple husbands.
            Despite the allowance for polygamy in some societies, monogamy
            remains more widely practiced.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            3. Serial Monogamy:
        </strong>
        This form allows individuals to marry again, typically after the death
        of a spouse or divorce, but prohibits having more than one spouse at the
        same time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Widow Remarriage:
        </strong>
        <strong>
            Historically
        </strong>
        , widow remarriage was restricted, particularly among upper-caste
        Hindus, and became a significant issue during the 19th-century reform
        movements.
        <strong>
            In contemporary India
        </strong>
        , widowhood is still prevalent, with nearly 10% of all women and 55% of
        women over fifty being widows.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Polyandry and Economic Conditions:
        </strong>
        Polyandry can arise in response to harsh economic conditions where a
        single male cannot adequately support a wife and children. In extreme
        poverty, polyandry may also serve as a means of population limitation.

            The Matter of Arranging Marriages: Rules and Prescriptions
        </strong>
    </h3>
    Mate selection varies across communities, with some allowing individuals to
    freely choose their own partners, while others involve parents or relatives
    in making such decisions."
" Rules of Endogamy and Exogamy
 In some societies these restrictions
 are subtle, while in some others,
 individuals who can or cannot be
 married, are more explicitly and
 specifically defined. Forms of marriage
 based on rules governing eligibility/
 ineligibility of mates is classified as
 endogamy and exogamy.
 Endogamy requires an individual
 to marry within a culturally defined
 group of which he or she is already a
 member, as for example, caste.
 Exogamy, the reverse of endogamy,
 requires the individual to marry outside
 of his/her own group. Endogamy and
 exogamy are in reference to certain
 kinship units, such as, clan, caste and
 racial, ethnic or religious groupings. In
 India, village exogamy is practised in
 certain parts of north India. Village
 exogamy ensured that daughters were
 married into families from villages far
 away from home. This arrangement
 ensured smooth transition and
 adjustment of the bride into the affinal
 home without interference of her
 kinsmen. The geographical distance
 plus the unequal relationship in the
 patrilineal system ensured that married
 daughters did not get to see their
 parents too often. Thus parting from
 natal home was a sad occasion and is
 the theme of folk songs, which depict
 the pain of departure.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h3>

"LOCATIONAL SETTING
 India is located in the northern hemisphere. The Tropic
 of Cancer (23°30'N) passes almost halfway through the
 country (Figure 7.2). From south to north, main land
 of India extends between 8°4'N and 37°6'N latitudes.
 From west to east, India extends between 68°7'E and
 97°25'E longitudes. If we divide the world into eastern
 and western hemispheres, which hemisphere would
 India belong to? Due to great longitudinal extent of
 about 29°, there could be a wide differences in local
 time of places located at two extreme points of India. As
 such, the difference between these two points would be of
about two hours. As you have learnt earlier, the local time changes by four minutes
 for every one degree of longitude. The sun rises about two hours earlier in the east
 (Arunachal Pradesh) than in the west (Gujarat). You have already read earlier, why
 the local time of longitude of 82°30'E has been taken as the Indian Standard Time.

" POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS
 India is a vast country. For administrative purposes, the country is divided into 28
States and 8 Union Territories (Appendix-I). Delhi is
 the national capital. The states have been formed
 mainly on the basis of languages.
 PHYSICAL DIVISIONS
 India is marked by a diversity of physical features
 such as mountains, plateaus, plains, coasts and
 islands. Standing as sentinels in the north are the
 lofty snow-capped Himalayas. Him+alaya mean ‘the
 abode of snow’. The Himalayan mountains are
 divided into three main parallel ranges. The
 northernmost is the Great Himalaya or Himadri.
 The world’s highest peaks are located in this range.
 Middle Himalaya or Himachal lies to the south of
 Himadri. Many
 popular hill stations are situated here. Find out the
 names of five hill stations. The Shiwalik is the
 southernmost range.
 The Northern Indian plains lie to the south of the
 Himalayas. They are generally level and flat. These are
 formed by the alluvial deposits laid down by the rivers
the Indus, the Ganga, the Brahmaputra and their
 tributaries. These river plains  provide fertile land for
 cultivation. That is the reason for high concentration of
 population in these plains.
 In the western part of India lies the Great Indian
 desert. It is a dry, hot and sandy stretch of land. It has
 very little vegetation.
 To the south of northern plains lies the Peninsular
 plateau. It is triangular in shape. The relief is highly
 uneven. This is a region with numerous hill ranges and
 valleys. Aravali hills, one of the oldest ranges of the world,
 border it on the north-west side. The Vindhyas and the
 Satpuras are the important ranges. The rivers Narmada
 and Tapi flow through these ranges. These are west
flowing rivers that drain into the Arabian Sea. The Western
 Ghats or Sahyadris border the plateau in the west and
 the Eastern Ghats provide the eastern boundary. While
 the Western Ghats are almost continuous, the Eastern
 Ghats are broken and uneven (Figure 7.3). The plateau is
 rich in minerals like coal and iron-ore.
 To the West of the Western Ghats and the East of
 Eastern Ghats lie the Coastal plains. The westerncoastal plains are very narrow. The eastern Coastal plains are much broader. There
 are a number of east flowing rivers. The rivers Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and
 Kaveri drain into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers have formed fertile deltas at their
 mouth. The Sunderban delta is formed where the Ganga and Brahmaputra flow
 into the Bay of Bengal
Two groups of islands also form part of India.
 Lakshadweep Islands are located in the Arabian Sea.
 These are coral islands located off the coast of Kerala.
 The Andaman and the Nicobar Islands lie to the
 southeast of the Indian mainland in the Bay of Bengal.

" ALGAE
 Algae are chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely
 aquatic (both fresh water and marine) organisms. They occur in a
 variety of other habitats: moist stones, soils and wood. Some of them
 also occur in association with fungi (lichen) and animals (e.g., on sloth
 bear).
 The form and size of algae is highly variable, ranging from colonial
 forms like Volvox and the filamentous forms like Ulothrix and Spirogyra
 (Figure 3.1). A few of the marine forms such as kelps, form massive plant
 bodies.
 The algae reproduce by vegetative, asexual and sexual methods.
 Vegetative reproduction is by fragmentation. Each fragment develops into
 a thallus. Asexual reproduction is by the production of different types of
 spores, the most common being the zoospores. They are flagellated
 (motile) and on germination gives rise to new plants. Sexual reproduction
 takes place through fusion of two gametes. These gametes can be
 flagellated and similar in size (as in Ulothrix) or non-flagellated (non-motile)
 but similar in size (as in Spirogyra). Such reproduction is called
 isogamous. Fusion of two gametes dissimilar in size, as in species of
 Eudorina is termed as anisogamous. Fusion between one large, non
motile (static) female gamete and a smaller, motile male gamete is termed
 oogamous, e.g., Volvox, Fucus

" 3.1.1 Chlorophyceae
 The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The
 plant body may be unicellular, colonial or filamentous. They are usually
 grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The
 pigments are localised in definite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be
 discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in
 different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies
 called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein
 besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets.
 Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose
 and an outer layer of pectose.
 Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by
 formation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by
 flagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction
 shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it
 may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found
 green algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara
 (Figure 3.1a).
 3.1.2 Phaeophyceae
 The members of phaeophyceae or brown algae are found primarily in
 marine habitats. They show great variation in size and form. They range
 from simple branched, filamentous forms (Ectocarpus) to profusely
 branched forms as represented by kelps, which may reach a height of
 100 metres. They possess chlorophyll a, c, carotenoids and xanthophylls.
 They vary in colour from olive green to various shades of brown depending
 upon the amount of the xanthophyll pigment, fucoxanthin present in

 them. Food is stored as complex carbohydrates, which may be in the
 form of laminarin or mannitol. The vegetative cells have a cellulosic wall
 usually covered on the outside by a gelatinous coating of algin. The
 protoplast contains, in addition to plastids, a centrally located vacuole
 and nucleus. The plant body is usually attached to the substratum by a
 holdfast, and has a stalk, the stipe and leaf like photosynthetic organ 
the frond. Vegetative reproduction takes place by fragmentation. Asexual
 reproduction in most brown algae is by biflagellate zoospores that are
 pear-shaped and have two unequal laterally attached flagella.
 Sexual reproduction may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous.
 Union of gametes may take place in water or within the oogonium
 (oogamous species). The gametes are pyriform (pear-shaped) and bear
 two laterally attached flagella. The common forms are Ectocarpus, Dictyota,
 Laminaria, Sargassum and Fucus (Figure 3.1b).
 3.1.3 Rhodophyceae
 The members of rhodophyceae are commonly called red algae because of
 the predominance of the red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body. Majority
 of the red algae are marine with greater concentrations found in the warmer
 areas. They occur in both well-lighted regions close to the surface of water
 and also at great depths in oceans where relatively little light penetrates.
 The red thalli of most of the red algae are  multicellular. Some of them
 have complex body organisation. The food is stored as floridean starch
 which is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure.
 The red algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation. They
 reproduce asexually by non-motile spores and sexually by non-motile
 gametes. Sexual reproduction is oogamous and accompanied by complex
 post fertilisation developments. The common members are: Polysiphonia,
 Porphyra (Figure 3.1c), Gracilaria and Gelidium",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h2>

        <p>
            Green algae, members of Chlorophyceae, are often called so because
            of their green color, which comes from chlorophyll a and b pigments.
            They can exist as single cells, colonies, or thread-like structures.

"Context of the 1990s
 You have read in the last chapter that Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime 
Minister after the assassination of Indira Gandhi. He led the Congress 
to a massive victory in the Lok Sabha elections held immediately 
thereafter in 1984. As the decade of the eighties came to a close, the 
country witnessed five developments that were to make a long-lasting 
impact on our politics. 
First the most crucial development of this period was the defeat 
of the Congress party in the elections held in 1989. The party 
that had won as many as 415 seats in the Lok Sabha in 1984 
was reduced to only 197 in this election. The Congress improved 
its performance and came back to power soon after the mid-term 
elections held in 1991. But the elections of 1989 marked the end of 
what political scientists have called the ‘Congress system’. To be sure, 
the Congress remained an important party and ruled the country 
more than any other party even in this period since 1989. But it lost 
the kind of centrality it earlier enjoyed in the party system
Third, the economic policy followed by the various governments 
took a radically different turn. This is known as the initiation 
of the structural adjustment programme or the new economic 
reforms.  Started by Rajiv Gandhi, these changes first became very 
visible in 1991 and radically changed the direction that the Indian 
economy had pursued since Independence. These policies have been 
widely criticised by various movements and organisations. But the 
various governments that came to power in this period have continued 
to follow these. 
Fourth, the centuries old legal and political dispute over the 
Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya started influencing the 
politics of India which gave birth to various political changes. 
The Ram Janmabhoomi Temple Movement, becoming the central 
issue, transformed the direction of the discourse on secularism and 
democracy. These changes culminated in the construction of the Ram 
Temple at Ayodhya following the decision of the constitutional bench 
of the Supreme Court (which was announced on November 9, 2019).   
Finally, the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in May 1991 led to a 
change in leadership of the Congress party. He was assassinated 
by a Sri Lankan Tamil linked to the LTTE  when he was on 
an election campaign tour in Tamil Nadu. In the elections of 1991, 
Congress emerged as the single largest party. Following Rajiv Gandhi’s 
death, the party chose Narsimha Rao as the Prime Minister.

        <strong>
            five key developments

        emerged that would significantly impact Indian politics.

            , the Congress party was defeated, dropping from 415 seats in 1984
            to 197 seats.
        </li>
        <li>
            The 1989 elections marked the end of the
            <strong>
                'Congress system.'
            </strong>
        </li>

                Mandal issue
            </strong>
            ' emerged in national politics when the National Front government
            decided in 1990 to implement the Mandal Commission's recommendation
            to
            <strong>
                reserve central government jobs for Other Backward Classes
                (OBCs).
            </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            This led to violent protests across the country against the OBC

" Era of Coalitions
 Elections in 1989 led to the defeat of the Congress party but did not 
result in a majority for any other party. Though the Congress was the 
largest party in the Lok Sabha, it did not have a clear majority and 
therefore, it decided to sit in the opposition. The National Front (which 
itself was an alliance of Janata Dal and some other regional parties) 
received support from two diametrically opposite political groups: the 
BJP and the Left Front. On this basis, the National Front formed a 
coalition government, but the BJP and the Left Front did not join in 
this government.  Decline of Congress

 The defeat of the Congress party marked the end of Congress dominance 
over the Indian party system. Do you remember the discussion in 
Chapters about the restoration of the Congress system? Way back in 
the late sixties, the dominance of the Congress party was challenged; 
but the Congress under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, managed to 
re-establish its predominant position in politics. The nineties saw yet 
another challenge to the predominant position of the Congress. It did 
not, however, mean the emergence of any other single party to fill in 
its place.  Thus, began an era of multi-party system. To be sure, a large 
number of political parties always contested elections in our country. 
Our Parliament always had representatives from several political 
parties. What happened after 1989 was the emergence of several 
parties in such a way that one or two parties did not get most of 
the votes or seats. This also meant that no single party secured a 
clear majority of seats in any Lok Sabha election held since 1989 till 
2014. This development initiated an era of coalition governments at 
the Centre, in which regional parties played a crucial role in forming 
ruling alliances but in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha election, the BJP 
got clear majority on its own.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

"Alliance politics
 The nineties also saw the emergence of powerful parties and movements 
that represented the Dalit and backward castes (Other Backward 
Classes or OBCs). Many of these parties represented powerful 
regional assertion as well. These parties played an important role in 
the United Front government that came to power in 1996. The United 
Front was similar to the National Front of 1989 for it included Janata 
Dal and several regional parties. This time the BJP did not support 
the government. The United Front government was supported by 
the Congress. This shows how unstable the political equations were. 
In 1989, both the Left and the BJP supported the National Front 
Government because they wanted to keep the Congress out of power. 
In 1996, the Left continued to support the non-Congress government 
but this time the Congress, supported it, as both the Congress and 
the Left wanted to keep the BJP out of power. 
They did not succeed for long, as the BJP continued to 
consolidate its position in the elections of 1991 and 1996. It 
emerged as the largest party in the 1996 election and was invited 
to form the government. But most other parties were opposed to 
its policies and therefore, the BJP government could not secure 
a majority in the Lok Sabha. It finally came to power by leading  a coalition government from May 1998 to June 1999 and was  
re-elected in October 1999. Atal Behari Vajpayee was the Prime 
Minister during both these NDA governments and his government 
formed in 1999 completed its full term. Thus, with the elections of 1989, a long phase of coalition politics 
began in India.  Since then, there have been eleven governments at 
the Centre, all of which have either been coalition governments or 
minority governments supported by other parties, which did not join 
the government. In this new phase, any government could be formed 
only with the participation or support of many regional parties. This 
applied to the National Front in 1989, the United Front in 1996 and 
1997, the BJP-led coalition in 1998, the NDA in 1999, the UPA in 
2004 and 2009.  However, this trend changed in 2014.
 Let us connect this development with what we have learnt so far. 
The era of coalition governments may be seen as a long-term trend 
resulting from relatively silent changes that were taking place over 
the last few decades.  
We saw in Chapter Two that in earlier times, it was the Congress 
party itself that was a ‘coalition’ of different interests and different social 
strata and groups.  This gave rise to the term ‘Congress system’. We also saw in Chapters that, especially since the late 1960s, 
various sections had been leaving the Congress fold and forming 
separate political parties of their own. We also noted the rise of many 
regional parties in the period after 1977.  While these developments 
weakened the Congress party, they did not enable any single party to 
replace the Congress.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

"Political Rise of Other Backward Classes
 One long-term development of this period was the rise of Other 
Backward Classes as a political force. You have already come across 
this term ‘OBC’. This refers to the administrative category ‘Other 
Backward Classes’. These are communities other than SC and ST 
who suffer from educational and social backwardness. These are also 
referred to as ‘backward castes’. We have already noted in Chapter 
Six that the support for the Congress among many sections of the 
‘backward castes’ had declined. This created a space for non-Congress 
parties that drew more support from these communities. You would 
recall that the rise of these parties first found political expression 
at the national level in the form of the Janata Party government in 
1977. Many of the constituents of the Janata Party, like the Bharatiya 
Kranti Dal and the Samyukta Socialist Party, had a powerful rural 
base among some sections of the OBC.
 ‘Mandal’ implemented
 In the 1980s, the Janata Dal brought together a similar combination 
of political groups with strong support among the OBCs. The decision 
of the National Front government to implement the recommendationsof the Mandal Commission further helped in shaping the politics of 
‘Other Backward Classes’. The intense national debate for and against 
reservation in jobs made people from the OBC communities more 
aware of this identity. Thus, it helped those who wanted to mobilise 
these groups in politics. This period saw the emergence of many 
parties that sought better opportunities for OBCs in education and 
employment and also raised the question of the share of power enjoyed 
by the OBCs. These parties claimed that since OBCs constituted a 
large segment of Indian society, it was only democratic that the OBCs 
should get adequate representation in administration and have their 
due share of political power.
 The Mandal Commission
 Reservations	for	the	OBC	were	in	existence	in	southern	States	since	the	1960s,	
if	not	earlier.	But	this	policy	was	not	operative	in	north	Indian	States.	It	was	
during the tenure of Janata Party government in 1977-79 that the demand for 
reservations for backward castes in north India and at the national level was 
strongly raised. Karpoori Thakur, the then Chief Minister	of	Bihar,	was	a	pioneer	
in this direction. His government had introduced a new policy of reservations for 
OBCs	in	Bihar.	Following	this,	the	central	government	appointed		a	Commission	
in 1978 to look into and recommend ways to improve the conditions of the 
backward classes. This was the second time since Independence that the 
government had appointed such a commission. Therefore, this commission 
was	officially	known	as	the	Second	Backward	Classes	Commission.	Popularly,	
the	commission	is	known	as	the	Mandal	Commission,	after	the	name	of	its	
Chairperson,	Bindeshwari	Prasad	Mandal.	
The	Mandal	Commission	was	set	up	to	
B.P. Mandal  
(1918-1982): M.P.	from	
Bihar	for	1967-1970	
and 1977-1979; chaired 
the	Second	Backward	
Classes	Commission	
that recommended 
reservations	for	Other	
Backward	Classes;	a	
socialist	leader	from	Bihar;	
Chief	Minister	of	Bihar	for	
just	a	month	and	a	half	in	
1968;	joined	the	Janata	
Party in 1977.
 investigate the extent of educational and social 
backwardness among various sections of Indian 
society and recommend ways of identifying these 
‘backward classes’.  It was also expected to give 
its recommendations on the ways in which this 
backwardness	could	be	ended.		The	Commission	
gave	its	recommendations	in	1980.		By	then	the	Janata	
government	had	fallen.	The	Commission	advised	
that ‘backward classes’ should be understood to 
mean ‘backward castes’, since many castes, other 
than	the	Scheduled	Castes,	were	also	treated	as	
low	in	the	caste	hierarchy.	The	Commission	did	a	
survey and found that these backward castes had 
a very low presence in both educational institutions 
and in employment in public services. It therefore 
recommended reserving 27 per cent of seats in 
educational	institutions	and	government	jobs	for	
these	groups.	The	Mandal	Commission	also	made	
many other recommendations, like, land reform, to 
improve	the	conditions	of	the	OBCs.
 In	August	1990,	the	National	Front	government	
decided to implement one of the recommendations 
of	Mandal	Commission	pertaining	to	reservations	
for	OBCs	in	jobs	in	the	central	government	and	its	
undertakings. This decision sparked agitations and 
violent protests in many cities of north India. The 
decision	was	also	challenged	in	the	Supreme	Court	and	came	to	be	known	
as the ‘Indira Sawhney case’, after the name of one of the petitioners. In 
November	1992,	the	Supreme	Court	gave	a	ruling	upholding	the	decision	of	
the government.  There were some differences among political parties about 
the	manner	of	implementation	of	this	decision.	But	now	the	policy	of	reservation	
for	OBCs	has	support	of	all	the	major	political	parties	of	the	country.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

    </ul>"
"Political fallouts
 The 1980s also saw the rise of political organisation of the Dalits. 
In 1978 the Backward and Minority Communities Employees 
Federation (BAMCEF) was formed. This organisation was not an 
ordinary trade union of government employees. It took a strong 
position in favour of political power to the ‘bahujan’ – the SC, 
ST, OBC and minorities. It was out of this that the subsequent 
Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti and later the Bahujan 
Samaj Party (BSP) emerged under the leadership of Kanshi 
Ram. The BSP began as a small party supported largely by Dalit 
voters in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. But in 1989 and 
the 1991 elections, it achieved a breakthrough in Uttar Pradesh. 
This was the first time in independent India that a political 
party supported mainly by Dalit voters had achieved this kind of  
political success. 
In fact, the BSP, under Kanshi Ram’s leadership was envisaged 
as an organisation based on pragmatic politics. It derived 
confidence from the fact that the Bahujans (SC, ST, OBC and 
religious minorities)  constituted the majority of the population, 
and were a formidable political force on the strength of their 
numbers.  Since then the BSP has emerged as a major political 
player in the State and has been in government on more than one 
occasion. Its strongest support still comes from Dalit voters, but 
it has expanded its support now to various other social groups. In 
many parts of India, Dalit politics and OBC politics have developed 
independently and often in competition with each other.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

"Communalism, Secularism, Democracy
 The other long-term development during this period was the visible 
rise of politics based on religious identity leading to a debate 
about secularism and democracy. We noted in Chapter Six that 
in the aftermath of the Emergency, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh had 
merged with the Janata Party. After the fall of the Janata Party and 
its break-up, the supporters of erstwhile Jana Sangh formed the 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980. Initially, the BJP adopted 
a broader political platform than that of the Jana Sangh. BJP 
embraced ‘Gandhian’ Socialism’ along with cultural nationalism as 
its ideology. But it did not get much success in the elections held in 
1984. After 1986, the party began to emphasise nationalism as the 
core of its ideology. The BJP also pursued the politics of ‘Hindutva’ 
for political mobilisation.     
Hindutva was popularised by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, as the 
basis of Indian nationhood. It basically meant that to be an Indian, 
one must accept India as their ‘fatherland’ (pitrubhu) as well as their 
holy land (punyabhu). Believers of ‘Hindutva’ argue that a strong 
nation can be built on the basis of a united national culture. They 
also believe that in the case of India, Hindutva can provide this base.
 Two developments around 1986 became central to the politics of 
BJP. The first was the Shah Bano case in 1985. In this case a 62
year old divorced Muslim woman, had filed a case for maintenance 
from her former husband. The Supreme Court ruled in favour of 
Shah Bano. The orthodox Muslims saw the Supreme Court’s order 
as an interference in Muslim Personal Law. On the demand of 
some Muslim leaders, the government passed the Muslim Women 
(Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 that nullified the Supreme 
Court’s judgement. This action of the government was opposed 
by many women’s organisations, many Muslim groups and most 
of the intellectuals. The BJP criticised this action of the Congress 
government as an unnecessary concession and ‘appeasement’ of the 
minority community.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

" Ayodhya Issue
 The Ayodhya issue, as the second significant development, was 
deeply rooted in socio- cultural and political history of the country 
pertaining to different perspectives from various stakeholders. It 
involved contentions regarding the birth place of Shri Ram, one of 
the most holy religious sites, and its legal ownership. 
The significance of Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi site can be 
judged by the fact that the 500-year long history, starting from 1528, 
is marked by numerous conflicts which are also documented in 
Lucknow, Barabanki and Faizabad district Gazetteers. A three-dome
structure was built at the site of Shri Ram’s birth place in 1528, 
but the structure had visible display of Hindu symbols and relics in 
its interior as well as its exterior portions. Therefore, Ayodhya Ram 
Janmabhoomi issue got linked to the national pride in its ancient 
civilization. Over the years, this issue evolved into a prolonged legal 
battle, leading to the structure being sealed in 1949 due to the onset 
of court proceedings.     
In 1986, the situation regarding the three-dome structure took a 
significant turn when the Faizabad (now Ayodhya) district court ruled 
to unlock the structure, allowing people to worship there. The dispute 
had been going on for many decades as it was believed that the three
dome structure was built at Shri Ram’s birthplace after demolition 
of a temple. However, although Shilaanyas for the temple was done, 
further construction remained prohibited. The Hindu community 
felt that their concerns related to the birth place of Shri Ram were 
overlooked, while the Muslim community sought assurance of their 
possession over the structure. Subsequently, tensions heightened 
between both communities over ownership rights, resulting in 
numerous disputes and legal conflicts. Both communities desired 
a fair resolution to the longstanding issue. In 1992, following the 
demolition of the structure, some critics contended that it presented 
a substantial challenge to the principles of Indian democracy.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

" From Legal Proceedings to Amicable Acceptance 
It is important to note that in any society conflicts are bound to take 
place. However, in a multi -religious and multi-cultural democratic 
society, these conflicts are usually resolved following the due process 
of law. Through a number of democratic and legal procedures 
including court hearings, mediation attempts, popular movements, 
and finally with a 5-0 verdict of a constitutional bench of the Supreme 
Court on November 9, 2019, the Ayodhya issue was resolved. This 
verdict sought to reconcile the conflicting interests of the various 
stakeholders involved in the dispute. 
The verdict allotted the disputed site to the Shri Ram 
Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust for the construction of Ram 
temple and directed the concerned government to allot appropriate 
site for the construction of a Mosque to the Sunni Central Waqf 
Board. In this way, democracy gives room for conflict resolution 
in a plural society like ours, upholding the inclusive spirit of the 
Constitution. This issue was resolved following the due process of 
law based on evidences such as archaeological excavations and 
historical records. The Supreme Court’s decision was celebrated by 
the society at large. It is a classic example of consensus building 
on a sensitive issue that shows the maturity of democratic ethos 
which are civilizationally ingrained in India.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

" Emergence of a new consensus
 The period after 1989 is seen sometimes as the period of decline of 
Congress and rise of BJP. If you want to understand the complex 
nature of political competition in this period, you have to compare the 
electoral performances of the Congress and the BJP. Now let us try to understand the meaning of the information given in 
the figure. 
•	You will notice that BJP and Congress were engaged in a tough 
competition in this period. What is the difference between their 
electoral fortunes if you compare these with the 1984 elections?  
.•	You	will	notice	that	since	the	1989	election,	the	votes	polled	by	
the	two	parties,	Congress	and	the	BJP,	most	of	the	time,	add	up	
to	more	than	fifty	per	cent	except	in	1996,	2004	and	2009.		
•	Look	at	both	the	charts	showing	Congress	and	Janata	‘family’	of	
parties. Which among the parties that exist today are neither part 
of Congress family of parties nor part of Janata family of parties? 
•	The	political	competition	during	the	nineties	is	divided	between	
the coalition led by BJP and the coalition led by the Congress. Can 
you list the parties that are not part of any of these two coalitions? 
Lok Sabha Elections (2004-2019)
 In	the	elections	of	2004,	the	Congress	party	too	entered	into	coalitions	
in	a	big	way.	The	National	Democratic	Alliance	(NDA)	was	defeated	
and	a	new	coalition	government	led	by	the	Congress,	known	as	the	
United	Progressive	Alliance	(UPA)	came	to	power.	This	government	
received	support	from	the	Left	Front	parties.	The	elections	of	2004	
also witnessed the partial revival of Congress party. It could increase its	seats	once	again	after	1991.	However,	in	the	2004	elections,	there	
was a negligible difference between the votes polled by the Congress 
and its allies and the BJP and its allies. 
The	Congress	led	UPA	government	completed	its	term	despite	Left	
parties	withdrawing	the	support	in	July	2008	on	the	issue	of	Indo-	
US	nuclear	deal.	Elections	for	15th	Lok	Sabha	were	held	in	2009.	
Results	witnessed	a	rise	in	the	number	of	seats	(from	145	in	2004	to	
206	in	2009)	of	the	Indian	National	Congress	(INC)	and	Congress	led	
UPA	Government.	Dr.	Manmohan	Singh	was	sworn	as	Prime	Minister	
for	the	second	term,	heading	the	coalition	government	of	UPA	again.	
Bhartiya	Janata	Party	declared	Narendra	Modi	(then	the	Chief	
Minister	of	Gujrat)	as	its	Prime	Ministerial	candidate	in	September	
2013.	BJP	under	the	leadership	of	Narendra	Modi	got	a	clear	majority	
in	16th	Lok	Sabha	elections	held	in	2014.	BJP	won	282	seats	on	its	
own,	becoming	the	first	party	to	gain	single	party	majority	after	30	
years.	Despite	single-party	majority	of	its	own,	BJP	did	choose	to	
form	the	NDA	government	with	its	coalition	partners.
 Year	2014	was	a	proverbial	watershed	moment	of	Indian	politics.	
Narendra	Modi	led	NDA	government	rapidly	took	decisions	in	social	
sector,	foreign	policy	and	economic	policy.
 The	BJP	again	emerged	victorious	with	303	seats	of	its	own	in	
2019	Lok	Sabha	election.	Even	when	BJP	is	getting	full	majority,	
the	recognition	of	coalition	politics	is	still	relevant.	Thus,	the	party	
system has now changed almost dramatically from what it was till 
the seventies",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h2>

"Growing consensus
 However,	on	many	crucial	issues,	a	broad	agreement	has	emerged	
among most parties. In the midst of severe competition and many 
conflicts,	a	consensus	appears	to	have	emerged	among	most	parties.	
This	consensus	consists	of	four	elements.	
First,	agreement	on	new	economic	policies	–	while	many	groups	
are	opposed	to	the	new	economic	policies,		most	political	parties	
are	in	support	of	the		new	economic	policies.	Most	parties	believe	
that these policies would lead the country to prosperity and a status 
of economic power in the world. 
Second,		acceptance	of	the	political	and	social	claims	of	the	
backward	castes	–	political	parties	have	recognised	that	the	
social	and	political	claims	of	the	backward	castes	need	to	be	
accepted.	As	a	result,	all	political	parties	now	support	reservation	
of	seats	for	the	‘backward	classes’	in	education	and	employment Political parties are also willing to ensure that the OBCs get adequate 
share of power.
 Third,	acceptance	of	the	role	of	State	level	parties	in	governance	
of	the	country	–	the	distinction	between	State	level	and	national	
level	parties	is	fast	becoming	less	important.	As	we	saw	in	this	
chapter,	State	level	parties	are	sharing	power	at	the	national	level	
and	have	played	a	central	role	in	the	country’s	politics	of	last	twenty	
years or so.  
Fourth,	emphasis	on	pragmatic	considerations	rather	than	
ideological positions and political alliances without ideological 
agreement	–	coalition	politics	has	shifted	the	focus	of	political	
parties from ideological differences to power sharing arrangements. 
Thus,	most	parties	of	the	NDA	did	not	agree	with	the	‘Hindutva’		
ideology	of	the	BJP.	Yet,	they	came	together	to	form	a	government	
and remained in power for a full term.  
All	these	are	momentous	changes	and	are	going	to	shape	politics	
in the near future. We started this study of politics in India with the 
discussion	of	how	the	Congress	emerged	as	a	dominant	party.	From	
that	situation,	we	have	now	arrived	at	a	more	competitive	politics,	
but politics that is based on a certain implicit agreement among the 
main	political	actors.	Thus,	even	as	political	parties	act	within	the	
sphere	of	this	consensus,	popular	movements	and	organisations	
are	simultaneously	identifying	new	forms,	visions	and	pathways	of	
development.	Issues	like	poverty,	displacement,	minimum	wages,	
livelihood and social security are being put on the political agenda 
by	peoples’	movements,	reminding	the	state	of	its	responsibility.		
Similarly,	issues	of	justice	and	democracy	are	being	voiced	by	the	
people	in	terms	of	class,	caste,	gender	and	regions.		We	cannot	predict	
the	future	of	democracy.	All	we	know	is	that	democratic	politics	is	
here to stay in India and that it will unfold through a continuous 
churning of some of the factors mentioned in this chapter",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

            Conclusion

    </h2>
    <p>
        Since the 1990s, Indian politics has shifted from a single-party
        dominance to a vibrant multi-party system. The decline of Congress, the
        rise of regional and identity-based parties, and the BJP’s emergence as
        a major force reflect this transformation. Despite intense competition
        and conflict, there is broad agreement on key issues like economic
        policies and social justice. This evolving political landscape
        highlights India’s commitment to democracy and its ability to adapt to
        new realities.

" You must have observed that the land around
 you is put to different uses. Some land is
 occupied by rivers, some may have trees and
 on some parts roads and buildings have been
 built. Different types of lands are suited to
 different uses. Human beings thus, use land
 as a resource for production as well as residence
 and recreation. Thus, the building of your
 school, roads on which you travel, parks in
 which you play, fields in which crops are grown
 and the pastures where animals graze represent
 different uses to which land is put.
 Land Use Categories
 Land-use records are maintained by land
 revenue department. The land use categories
 add up to reporting area, which is somewhat
 different from the geographical area. The
 Survey of India is responsible for measuring
 geographical area of administrative units in
 India. Have you ever used a map prepared by
 Survey of India? The difference between the two
 concepts are that while the former changes
 somewhat depending on the estimates of the
 land revenue records, the latter does not change
 and stays fixed as per Survey of India
 measurements. You may be familiar with land
 use categories as they are also included in your
 Social Science textbook of Class X
Land-use Changes in India
 Land-use in a region, to a large extent, is
 influenced by the nature of economic
 activities carried out in that region. However,
 while economic activities change over time,
 land, like many other natural resources, is
 fixed in terms of its area. At this stage, one
 needs to appreciate three types of changes
 that an economy undergoes, which affect
 land-use.
 (i)
 The size of the economy (measured
 in terms of value for all the goods and
 services produced in the economy)
 grows over time as a result of
 increasing population, change in
 income levels, available technology
 and associated factors. As a result, the
 pressure on land will increase with
 time and marginal lands would come
 under use.
 (ii)
 (iii)
 Secondly, the composition of the
 economy would undergo a change over
 time. In other words, the secondary and
 the tertiary sectors usually grow much
 faster than the primary sector, specifically
 the agricultural sector. This type of
 change is common in developing
 countries, like India. This process would
 result in a gradual shift of land from
 agricultural uses to non-agricultural
 uses. You would observe that such
 changes are sharp around large urban
 areas. The agricultural land is being used
 for building purposes.
 Thirdly, though the contribution of the
 agricultural activities reduces over time,
 the pressure on land for agricultural
 activities does not decline. The reasons
 for continued pressure on agricultural
 land are:
 (a) In developing countries, the
 share of population dependent
 on agriculture usually declines
 much more slowly compared to
 the decline in the sector’s share
 in GDP.
 (b) The number of people that the
 agricultural sector has to feed is
 increasing day by dayThe four categories that have registered a
 decline are barren and wasteland, culturable
 wasteland, area under tree crops and groves
 and fallow lands.
 The following explanations can be given
 for the declining trends:
 (i)
 As the pressure on land increased, both
 from the agricultural and non
agricultural sectors, the wastelands and
 culturable wastelands have witnessed
 decline over time.
 (ii)
 The decline in land under tree crops  and
 groves can be explained by pressure
 from agricultural land.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

            Introduction

    </h2>
    <p>
        Land can be used in many ways: some areas have rivers, others have
        trees, and some are used for roads and buildings. Different types of
        land are good for different things. People use land to grow food, build
        homes, create parks, and make other useful things. For example, fertile
        land is great for farming, while flat land is perfect for building
        cities.

 Land, according to its ownership can broadly
 be classified under two broad heads – private
 land and common property resources (CPRs).
 While the former is owned by an individual or a
 group of individuals, the latter is owned by the
 state meant for the use of the community. CPRs
 provide fodder for the livestock and fuel for the
 households along with other minor forest
 products like fruits, nuts, fibre, medicinal
 plants, etc. In rural areas, such land is of  particular relevance for the livelihood of the
 landless and marginal farmers and other
 weaker sections since many of them depend on
 income from their livestock due to the fact that
 they have limited access to land. CPRs also are
 important for women as most of the fodder and
 fuel collection is done by them in rural areas.
 They have to devote long hours in collecting fuel
 and fodder from a degraded area of CPR.
 CPRs can be defined as community’s natural
 resource, where every member has the right of
 access and usage with specified obligations,
 without anybody having property rights over
 them. Community forests, pasture lands, village
 water bodies and other public spaces where a
 group larger than a household or family unit
 exercises rights of use and carries responsibility
 of management are examples of CPRs.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

" Agricultural Land Use in India
 Land resource is more crucial to the livelihood
 of the people depending on agriculture:
 (i)
 Agriculture is a purely land based
 activity unlike secondary and tertiary
 activities. In other words, contribution
 of land in agricultural output is more
 compared to its contribution in the
 outputs in the other sectors. Thus, lack
 of access to land is directly correlated
 with incidence of poverty in rural areas.
 (ii)
 (iii)
 Quality of land has a direct bearing on
 the productivity of agriculture, which is
 not true for other activities.
 In rural areas, aside from its value as a
 productive factor, land ownership has
 a social value and serves as a security
 for credit, natural hazards or life
 contingencies, and also adds to the social
 status.
 An estimation of the total stock of
 agricultural land resources (i.e. total cultivable
 land) can be arrived at by adding up net sown
 area, all fallow lands and culturable wasteland.
 It may be observed from Table 3.1 that over the
 years, there has been a marginal decline in the
 available total stock of cultivable land as a
 percentage to total reporting area. There has been
 a greater decline of cultivated land, in spite of a
 corresponding decline of cultivable wasteland.
 It is clear from the above discussion that
 the scope for bringing in additional land under
 net sown area in India is limited. There is, thus,
 an urgent need to evolve and adopt land-saving
 technologies. Such technologies can be classified
 under two heads – those which raise the yield
 of any particular crop per unit area of land and
 those which increase the total output per unit
 area of land from all crops grown over one
 agricultural year by increasing land-use
 intensity. The advantage of the latter kind of
 technology is that along with increasing output
 from limited land, it also increases the demand
 for labour significantly. For a land scarce but
 labour abundant country like India, a high
 cropping intensity is desirable not only for fuller
 utilisation of land resource, but also for
 reducing unemployment in the rural economy.
 The cropping intensity (CI) is calculated
 as follows :
 GCA
 Cropping Intensity in percentage NSA x 100",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

"Cropping Seasons in India
 There are three distinct crop
 seasons in the northern and
 interior parts of country, namely
 kharif, rabi and zaid.  The kharif
 season largely coincides with
 Southwest Monsoon under which
 the cultivation of tropical crops,
 such as rice, cotton, jute, jowar,
 bajra and tur is possible. The rabi
 season begins with the onset of
 winter in October-November and
 ends in March-April. The low
 temperature conditions during this
 season facilitate the cultivation of temperate and
 subtropical crops such as wheat, gram and
 mustard. Zaid is a short duration summer
 cropping season beginning after harvesting of
 rabi crops. The cultivation of watermelons,
 cucumbers, vegetables and fodder crops during
 this season is done on irrigated lands. However,
 this type of distinction in the cropping season
 does not exist in southern parts of the country.
 Here, the temperature is high enough to grow
 tropical crops during any period in the year
 provided the soil moisture is available.
 Therefore, in this region same crops can be grown
 thrice in an agricultural year provided there is
 sufficient soil moisture",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

"Types of Farming
 On the basis of main source of moisture for
 crops, the farming can be classified as irrigated
 and rainfed (barani).  There is difference in
 the nature of irrigated farming, as well as based
 on the objective of irrigation, i.e., protective or
 productive. The objective of protective irrigation
 is to protect the crops from adverse effects of soil
moisture deficiency which often means that
 irrigation acts as a supplementary source of water
 over and above the rainfall.  The strategy of this
 kind of irrigation is to provide soil moisture to
 maximum possible area.  Productive irrigation is
 meant to provide sufficient soil moisture in the
 cropping season to achieve high productivity.  In
 such irrigation the water input per unit area of
 cultivated land is higher than protective irrigation.
 Rainfed farming is further classified on the basis
 of adequacy of soil moisture during cropping
 season into dryland and wetland farming. In
 India, the dryland farming is largely confined
 to the regions having annual rainfall less than 75
 cm.  These regions grow hardy and drought
 resistant crops such as ragi, bajra, moong, gram
 and guar (fodder crops) and practise various
 measures of soil moisture conservation and rain
 water harvesting.  In wetland farming, the
 rainfall is in excess of soil moisture requirement
 of plants during rainy season. Such regions may
 face flood and soil erosion hazards.  These areas
 grow various water intensive crops such as rice,
 jute and sugarcane and practise aquaculture in
 the fresh water bodies",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

"Foodgrains
 The importance of foodgrains in Indian
 agricultural economy may be gauged from the
 fact these crops occupy about two-third of total
 cropped area in the country. Foodgrains are
 dominant crops in all parts of the country
 whether they have subsistence or commercial
 agricultural economy. On the basis of the
 structure of grain the foodgrains are classified
 as cereals and pulses.
 Cereals
 The cereals occupy about 54 per cent of total
 cropped area in India.  The country produces
 about 11 per cent cereals of the world and ranks
 third in production after China and U.S.A.  India
 produces a variety of cereals, which are
 classified as fine grains (rice, wheat) and coarse
 grains (jowar, bajra, maize, ragi), etc. Account
 of important cereals has been given in the
 following paragraphs  Rice
 Rice is a staple food for the overwhelming
 majority of population in India. Though, it is
 considered to be a crop of tropical humid areas,
 it has many varieties which are grown in
 different agro-climatic regions. These are
 successfully grown from sea level to about
 2,000 m altitude and from humid areas in
 eastern India to dry but irrigated areas of
 Punjab, Haryana, western U.P. and northern
 Rajasthan. In southern states and West Bengal
 the climatic conditions allow the cultivation of
 two or three crops of rice in an agricultural year.
 In West Bengal farmers grow three crops of rice
 called ‘aus’, ‘aman’ and ‘boro’.  But in
 Himalayas and northwestern parts of the
 country, it is grown as a kharif crop during
 southwest Monsoon season.
 India contributes 22.07 per cent of rice
 production in the world and ranked second
 after China in 2018.  About one-fourth of the
 total cropped area in the country is under rice
 cultivation. West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and
 Punjab are the leading rice producing states
 in the country.  The yield level of rice is high in
 Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh,
 Telangana, West Bengal and Kerala.  In the first
 four of these states almost the entire land under
 rice cultivation is irrigated. Punjab and Haryana
 are not traditional rice growing areas. Rice cultivation in the irrigated areas of Punjab and
 Haryana was introduced in 1970s following the
 Green Revolution. Genetically improved varieties
 of seed, relatively high usage of fertilizers and
 pesticides and lower levels of susceptibility of
 the crop to pests due to dry climatic conditionsare responsible for higher yield of rice in this
 region.  The yield of this crop is very low in rainfed
 areas of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and
 Odisha.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

" Wheat
 Wheat is the second most important cereal crop
 in India after rice. India produces about
 12.8 per cent of total wheat production of world
 (2017). It is primarily a crop of temperate zone.
 Hence, its cultivation in India is done during
 winter i.e. rabi season. About 85 per cent of total
 area under this crop is concentrated in north
 and central regions of the country i.e. Indo
Gangetic Plain, Malwa Plateau and Himalayas
 up to 2,700 m altitude. Being a rabi crop, it is
 mostly grown under irrigated conditions.  But it
 is a rainfed crop in Himalayan highlands and
 parts of Malwa plateau in Madhya Pradesh.
 About 14 per cent of the total cropped area
 in the country is under wheat cultivation. Uttar
 Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana
 and Rajasthan are leading wheat producing
 states.  The yield level of wheat is very high
 (above 4,000 k.g. per ha) in Punjab and
 Haryana whereas, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan
 and Bihar have moderate yields. The states like
 Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and
 Jammu and Kashmir growing wheat under
 rainfed conditions have low yield.
 Jowar
 The coarse cereals together occupy about
 16.50 per cent of total cropped area in the
 country. Among these, jowar or sorghum alone
 accounts for about 5.3 per cent of total
 cropped area. It is main food crop in semi-arid
 areas of central and southern India.
 Maharashtra alone produces more than half
 of the total jowar production of the country.
 Other leading producer states of jowar are
 Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh
 and Telangana.  It is sown in both kharif and
 rabi seasons in southern states. But it is a
 kharif crop in northern India where it is mostly
 grown as a fodder crop. South of Vindhyachal
 it is a rainfed crop and its yield level is very
 low in this region.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<p>

" Bajra
 Bajra is sown in hot and dry climatic conditions
 in northwestern and western parts of the
 country. It is a hardy crop which resists
 frequent dry spells and drought in this region.
 It is cultivated alone as well as part of mixed
 cropping. This coarse cereal occupies about
 5.2 per cent of total cropped area in the
 country.  Leading producers of bajra are the
 states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat,
 Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Yield of this crop
 has increased during recent years in
 Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujarat due to
 introduction of drought resistant varieties and
 expansion of irrigation under it.
 Maize
 Maize is a food as well as fodder crop grown
 under semi-arid climatic conditions and over
 inferior soils.  This crop occupies only about
 3.6 per cent of total cropped area. Maize
 cultivation is not concentrated in any specific
 region. It is sown all over India exceptPunjab
 and eastern and north-eastern regions. The
 leading producers of maize are the states of
 Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra
 Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan and Uttar
 Pradesh.  Yield level of maize is higher than other
 coarse cereals.  It is high in southern states and
 declines towards central parts.
 Pulses
 Pulses are a very important ingredient of
 vegetarian food as these are rich sources of
 proteins. These are legume crops which
 increase the natural fertility of soils through
 nitrogen fixation. India is a leading producer of
 pulses in the world. The cultivation of pulses
 in the country is largely concentrated in the
 drylands of Deccan and central plateaus and
 northwestern parts of the country. Pulses
 occupy about 11 per cent of the total cropped
 area in the country. Being the rainfed crops of
 drylands, the yields of pulses are low and
 fluctuate from year to year. Gram and tur are
 the main pulses cultivated in IndiaGram
 Gram is cultivated in subtropical areas. It is
 mostly a rainfed crop cultivated during rabi
 season in central, western and northwestern parts
 of the country. Just one or two light showers or
 irrigations are required to grow this crop
 successfully. It has been displaced from the
 cropping pattern by wheat in Haryana, Punjab
 and northern Rajasthan following the green
 revolution. At present, gram covers only about
 2.8 per cent of the total cropped area in the
 country. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh,
 Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and
 Rajasthan are the main producers of this pulse
 crop. The yield of this crop continues to be low
 and fluctuates from year to year even in irrigated
 areas.
 Tur (Arhar)
 Tur is the second important pulse crop in the
 country. It is also known as red gram or pigeon
 pea. It is cultivated over marginal lands and
 under rainfed conditions in the dry areas of
 central and southern states of the country.  This
 crop occupies only about 2 per cent of total
 cropped area of India. Maharashtra alone
 contributes about one-third of the total
 production of tur. Other leading producer states
 are Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and
 Madhya Pradesh. Per hectare output of this crop
 is very low and its performance is inconsistent.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <p>

" Oilseeds
 The oilseeds are produced for extracting edible
 oils. Drylands of Malwa plateau, Marathwada,
 Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana, Rayalseema
 region of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka
 plateau are oilseeds growing regions of India.
 These crops together occupy about 14 per cent
 of total cropped area in the country.
 Groundnut, rapeseed and mustard, soyabean
 and sunflower are the main oilseed crops grown
 in India.Groundnut
 India produces about 18.8 per cent of the total
 groundnut production in the world (2018). It is
 largely a rainfed kharif crop of drylands. But in
 southern India, it is cultivated during rabi season
 as well. It covers about 3.6 per cent of total
 cropped area in the country. Gujarat, Rajasthan,
 Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh,
 Karnataka and Maharashtra are the leading
 producers. Yield of groundnut is comparatively
 high in Tamil Nadu where it is partly irrigated.
 But its yield is low in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh
 and Karnataka.
 Rapeseed and Mustard
 Rapeseed and mustard comprise several oilseeds
 as rai, sarson, toria and taramira.  These are
 subtropical crops cultivated during rabi season
 in north-western and central parts of India.
 These are frost sensitive crops and their yields
 fluctuate from year to year.  But with the
 expansion of irrigation and improvement in seed
 technology, their yields have improved and
 stabilised to some extent. About two-third of the
 cultivated area under these crops is irrigated.
 These oilseeds together occupy only about
 2.5 per cent of total cropped area in the country.
 Rajasthan contributes about one-third
 production while other leading producers are
 Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.  Yields of these
 crops are comparatively high in Haryana and
 Rajasthan. Other Oilseeds
 Soyabean and sunflower are other important
 oilseeds grown in India. Soyabean is mostly
 grown in Madhya Pradesh and MaharashtraThese two states together produce about 90 per
 cent of total output of soyabean in the country.
 Sunflower cultivation is concentrated in
 Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and
 adjoining areas of Maharashtra. It is a minor
 crop in northern parts of the country where its
 yield is high due to irrigation",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h3>

" Fibre Crops
 These crops provide us fibre for preparing cloth,
 bags, sacks and a number of other items.
 Cotton and jute are two main fibre crops grown
 in India.
 Cotton
 Cotton is a tropical crop grown in kharif season
 in semi-arid areas of the country.  India lost a
 large proportion of cotton growing area to
 Pakistan during partition.  However, its acreage
 has increased considerably during the last 50
 years.  India grows both short staple (Indian)
 cotton as well as long staple (American) cotton
 called ‘narma’ in north-western parts of the
 country. Cotton requires clear sky during
 flowering stage.
 Fig. 3.7 : Cotton Cultivation
 Gujarat, Maharashtra and Telangana Per
 hectare output of cotton is high under irrigated
 conditions in north-western region of the
 country.  Its yield is very low in Maharashtra
 where it is grown under rainfed conditions.
 Jute
 Jute is used for making coarse cloth, bags, sacks
 and decorative items.  It is a cash crop in West
 Bengal and adjoining eastern parts of the
 country.  India lost large jute growing areas to
 East Pakistan (Bangladesh) during partition. At
 present, India produces about three-fifth of jute
 production of the world. West Bengal accounts
 for about three-fourth of the production in the
 country.  Bihar and Assam are other jute growing
 areas. Being concentrated only in a few states,
 this crop accounts for only about 0.5 per cent of
 total cropped area in the country",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

" Other Crops
 Sugarcane, tea and coffee are other important
 crops grown in India.
 Sugarcane
 Sugarcane is a crop of tropical areas.  Under
 rainfed conditions, it is cultivated in sub-humid
 and humid climates. But it is largely an irrigated
 crop in India. In Indo-Gangetic plain, its
 cultivation is largely concentrated in Uttar
 Pradesh. Sugarcane growing area in western
 India is spread over Maharashtra and Gujarat.In southern India, it is cultivated in irrigated
 tracts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana
 and Andhra Pradesh.
 India was the second largest producer of
 sugarcane after Brazil in 2018. It accounts for
 about 19.7 per cent of the world production of
 sugarcane.  But it occupies only 2.4 per cent of
 total cropped area in the country. Uttar Pradesh
 produces about two-fifth of sugarcane of
 the country.  Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil
 Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh are other leading
 producers of this crop where yield level of
 sugarcane is high. Its yield is low in northern
 India.
 Tea
 Tea is a plantation crop used as beverage. Black
 tea leaves are fermented whereas green tea leaves
 are unfermented. Tea leaves have rich content of
 caffeine and tannin. It is an indigenous crop of
 hills in northern China. It is grown over
 undulating topography of hilly areas and well
drained soils in humid and sub-humid tropics
 and sub-tropics. In India, tea plantation started
 in 1840s in Brahmaputra valley of Assam which
 still is a major tea growing area in the country.
 Later on, its plantation was introduced in the
 sub-Himalayan region of West Bengal (Darjeeling,
 Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts).  Tea is
 also cultivated on the lower slopes of Nilgiri and
 Fig. 3.10 : Tea Farming
 Cardamom hills in Western Ghats. India is a
 leading producer of tea and accounts for about
 21.22 per cent of total production in the world
 2018. India’s share in the international market
 of tea has declined substantially. It ranks
 second among tea exporting countries in the
 world after China (2018). Assam accounts for
 about 53.2 per cent of the total cropped area and
 contributes more than half of total production of
 tea in the country. West Bengal and Tamil Nadu
 are the other leading producers of tea.
 Coffee
 Coffee is a tropical plantation crop. Its seeds
 are roasted, ground and are used for preparing
 a beverage. There are three varieties of coffee
 i.e. arabica, robusta and liberica. India mostly
 grows superior quality coffee, arabica, which
 is in great demand in International market. But
 India produces only about 3.17 per cent coffee
 of the world and ranks eighth after Brazil,
 Vietnam, Indonesia, Colombia, Honduras,
 Ethiopia and Peru in 2018. Coffee is cultivated
 in the highlands of Western Ghats in
 Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Karnataka
 alone accounts for more than two-third of total
 production of coffee in the country",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<p>

" Agricultural Development in India
 Indian agricultural economy was largely
 subsistence in nature before Independence.  It
 had dismal performance in the first half of
 twentieth century. This period witnessed severe
 droughts and famines.  During partition about
 one-third of the irrigated land in undivided
 India went to Pakistan. This reduced the
 proportion of irrigated area in Independent
 India. After Independence, the immediate goal
 of the Government was to increase foodgrains
 production by (i) switching over from cash
 crops to food crops; (ii) intensification of
 cropping over already cultivated land; and (iii)
 increasing cultivated area by bringing cultivable
 and fallow land under plough. Initially, this
 strategy helped in increasing foodgrains
 production. But agricultural production
 stagnated during late –1950s. To overcome this
 problem, Intensive Agricultural District
 Programme (IADP) and Intensive Agricultural
 Area Programme (IAAP) were launched. But two
 consecutive droughts during mid-1960s
 resulted in food crisis in the country.
 Consequently, foodgrains were imported from
 other countriesNew seed varieties of wheat (Mexico) and
 rice (Philippines) known as high yielding
 varieties (HYVs) were available for cultivation
 by mid-1960s. India took advantage of this and
 introduced package technology comprising
 HYVs, along with chemical fertilisers in irrigated
 areas of Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar
 Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. Assured
 supply of soil moisture through irrigation was
 a basic pre-requisite for the success of this new
 agricultural technology. This strategy of
 agricultural development paid dividends
 instantly and increased the foodgrains
 production at very fast rate. This spurt of
 agricultural growth came to be known as
 ‘Green Revolution’. This also gave fillip to the
 development of a large number of agro-inputs,
 agro-processing industries and small-scale
 industries. This strategy of agricultural
 development made the country self-reliant in
 foodgrain production. But Green Revolution
 was initially confined to irrigated areas only.
 This led to regional disparities in agricultural
 development in the country till 1970s, after
 which the technology spread to the Eastern and
 Central parts of the country.
 The Planning Commission of India focused
 its attention on the problems of agriculture in
 rainfed areas in 1980s. It initiated agro-climatic
 planning in 1988 to induce regionally balanced
 agricultural development in the country. It also
 emphasised on the need for diversification of
 agriculture and harnessing of resources for the
 development of dairy farming, poultry,
 horticulture, livestock rearing and aquaculture.
 Initiation of the policy of liberalisation and
 free market economy in 1990s influenced the
 course of development of Indian agriculture.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.," <h2>

" Growth of Agricultural Output and Technology
 There has been a significant increase in
 agricultural output and improvement in
 technology during the last 50 years.
 • Production and yield of many crops such
 as rice and wheat has increased at an
 impressive rate. Among the other crops,
 the production of sugarcane, oilseeds and
 cotton has also increased appreciably.
 • Expansion of irrigation has played a
 crucial role in enhancing agricultural
 output in the country. It provided basis
 for introduction of modern agricultural
 technology, such as high yielding varieties
 of seeds, chemical fertilisers, pesticides and
 farm machinery. The net irrigated area in
 the country has also increased.
 • Modern agricultural technology has
 diffused very fast in various areas of the
 country. Consumption of chemical
 fertilizers has increased by 15 times since
 mid-sixties. Since the high yielding
 varieties are highly susceptible to pests
 and diseases, the use of pesticides has
 increased significantly since 1960s.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h3>

 The nature of problems faced by Indian
 agriculture varies according to agro-ecological
 and historical experiences of its different regions.
 Hence, most of the agricultural problems in the
 country are region specific. Yet, there are some
 problems which are common and range from
 physical constraints to institutional hindrances.
 A detailed discussion on these problems follows Dependence on Erratic Monsoon
 Irrigation covers only about 33 per cent of the
 cultivated area in India. The crop production
 in rest of the cultivated land directly depends
 on rain. Poor performance of south-west
 monsoon also adversely affects the supply of
 canal water for irrigation. On the other hand,
 the rainfall in Rajasthan and other drought
prone areas is too meagre and highly unreliable.
 Even the areas receiving high annual rainfall
 experience considerable fluctuations. This
 makes them vulnerable to both droughts and
 floods. Drought is a common phenomenon in
 the low rainfall areas, which may also experience
 occasional floods. The flash floods in drylands
 of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan in
 2006 and 2017 are examples of this
 phenomenon. Droughts and floods continue to
 be the twin menace in Indian agriculture.
 Low productivity
 The yield of the crops in the country is low in
 comparison to the international level. Per
 hectare output of most of the crops such as
 rice, wheat, cotton and oilseeds in India is
 much lower than that of the U.S.A., Russia and
 Japan. Because of the very high pressure on
 the land resources, the labour productivity in
 Indian agriculture is also very low in
 comparison to international level. The vast
 rainfed areas of the country, particularly
 drylands which mostly grow coarse cereals,
 pulses and oilseeds have low yields.
 Why is agricultural productivity low in
 dry regions?
 Constraints of Financial Resources and
 Indebtedness
 The inputs of modern agriculture are very
 expensive. This resource intensive approach has
 become unmanageable for marginal and small
 farmers as they have very meagre or no saving
 to invest in agriculture. To tide over these
 difficulties, most of such farmers have resorted
 to availing credit from various institutions and
 moneylenders. Crop failures and low returns
 from agriculture have forced them to fall in the
 trap of indebtedness.
 What are the implications of severe
 indebtedness? Do you feel that the
 recent incidents of farmers’ suicides in
 different states of the country are the
 result of indebtedness?
 Lack of Land Reforms
 Indian peasantry had been exploited for a long
 time as there had been unequal distribution of
 land. Among the three revenue systems
 operational during British period, i.e.,
 Mahalwari, Ryotwari and Zamindari, the last
 one was most exploitative for the peasants. After
 Independence, land reforms were accorded
 priority, but these reforms were not
 implemented effectively due to lack of strong
 political will. Most of the state governments
 avoided taking politically tough decisions
 which went against strong political lobbies of
 landlords. Lack of implementation of land
 reforms has resulted in continuation of
 inequitous distribution of cultivable land which
 is detrimental to agricultural development.
 Small Farm Size and Fragmentation of
 Landholdings
 There are a large number of marginal and small
 farmers in the country.  The average size of land
 holding is shrinking under increasing population pressure. Furthermore, in India, the
 land holdings are mostly fragmented. There are
 some states where consolidation of holding has
 not been carried out even once. Even the states
 where it has been carried out once, second
 consolidation is required as land holdings have
 fragmented again in the process of division of
 land among the owners of next generations. The
 small size fragmented landholdings are
 uneconomic.
 Lack of Commercialisation
 A large number of farmers produce crops for
 self-consumption. These farmers do not have
 enough land resources to produce more than
 their requirement. Most of the small and
 38
 38
 marginal farmers grow foodgrains, which are
 meant for their own family consumption.
 Modernisation and commercialisation of
 agriculture have, however, taken place in the
 irrigated areas.
 Vast Underemployment
 There is a massive underemployment in the
 agricultural sector in India, particularly in the
 unirrigated tracts. In these areas, there is a
 seasonal unemployment ranging from 4 to 8
 months. Even in the cropping season, work is
 not available throughout as agricultural
 operations are not labour intensive. Hence, the
 people engaged in agriculture do not have the
 opportunity to work round the year.
 38 India : People and Economy
 2024-25
Degradation of Cultivable Land
 One of the serious problems that arises out of
 faulty strategy of irrigation and agricultural
 development is degradation of land resources.
 This is serious because it may lead to depletion
 of soil fertility. The situation is particularly
 alarming in irrigated areas. A large tract of
 agricultural land has lost its fertility due to
 alkalisation and salinisation of soils and
 waterlogging. Excessive use of chemicals such
 as insecticides and pesticides has led to their
 concentration in toxic amounts in the soil
 profile. Leguminous crops have been displaced
 from the cropping pattern in the irrigated areas
 and duration of fallow has substantially
 reduced owing to multiple cropping. This has
 obliterated the process of natural fertilization
 such as nitrogen fixation. Rainfed areas in
 humid and semi-arid tropics also experience
 degradation of several types like soil erosion
 by water and wind erosion which are often
 induced by human activities.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information.,"<h2>

"Definition and Essentials of CONTRACT
A Contract is an agreement enforceable by law. An agreement is enforceable by law, if it
is made by the free consent of the parties who are competent to contract and the agreement
is made with a lawful object and is for a lawful consideration, and is not hereby expressly
declared to be void. The agreement which is not enforceable by law is not called contract.
Eg. An agreement to sell a radio set may be a contract, but an agreement to go to see a
movie may be a mere agreement not enforceable by law.
Agreement + Enforceability at law = Contract

                A contract is a legally enforceable agreement. For an agreement

                    The parties must be competent to contract, meaning they are
                    of legal age, sound mind, and not disqualified by law.

"Definition of AGREEMENT
According to S. 2 (e) ""Every promise and every set of promises, forning the consideration
for each other, is an agreement"". In an agreement there is a promise from both sides. Eg. A
promises to deliver his watch to B and in retum B Promises to pay a sum of Rs. to A.
There is said to be an agreement between A and B. A promise is the result of an offer by
one person and its acceptance by the other. Section 2(b) of the Act, defines ""promise"" as
""When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is
said to be accepted. A proposal, When accepted, becomes a promise.""
S.IO What agreements are contracts?
All agreements are contracts if they are made
• Between Two
Free consent of parties
Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the
same sense. Consent is free when it is not caused by mistake, misrepresentation, undue
influence, fraud or coercion. When consent is caused by any of above said elements, the
contract is voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused.
Competent to contract
Competent to contract means the legal ability of a person to enter into a valid contract.
Every person is competent to contract who (a) is of the age of majority according to the
law to which he is subject and (b) is of sound mind and (c) is not otherwise disqualified
from contracting by any law to which he is subject.
Lawful consideration and lawful Object
An agreement where the object or the consideration is unlawful is void. Object or
consideration is unlawful if it is forbidden by law, it defeats the provisions of law; or is
fraudulent, or involves injury to the person or property of another; or is immoral; or is
opposed to public policy. Besides the above said agreements, certain agreements have been expressly declared to be void by the Contract Act such as — wagering agreements,
agreement with uncertain meaning, agreements where consideration is unlawful in part
etc.
Are not hereby expressly declared to be void.
The agreement entered into must not be which the law declares to be either illegal or
void. An illegal agreement is an agreement expressly or impliedly prohibited by law. A
void agreement is one without any legal effects.","Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

"Different types of agreements
Void Agreements
An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void. For eg. an agreement by a minor
has been held to be void. Section 24 to 30 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, makes
specific mention of agreements which are void. Those agreements include an agreementwithout consideration, an agreement, in restraint of marriage, and an agreement in
restraint of trade.
Voidable Contracts
An agreement which is enforceable by law at the option of one or more of the parties
thereto, but not at the option of the other, is a voidable contract. Thus, a voidable
contract is one which could be avoided by one of the parties to the contract at his
option. For eg, when the consent of the party to a contract has been obtained by
coercion, undue influence, fraud and misrepresentation, the contract is voidable at the
option of the party whose consent has been so obtained.
Difference between Void Agreement and Voidable Contract
1. A voidable contract is voidable at the option of one of the parties thereto. But a void
agreement cannot be enforced by any one of the parties thereto.
2. The defect in the case of voidable contract is curable and may be condoned, whereas a void
agreement is void ab initio, and its defects are not curable.
3. A voidable contract does not become void unless the party at whose option it is voidable
repudiates it. But a void agreement is void ab initio.
4. A voidable contract implies a contract, in which the consent of one of the parties to contract is
not free, whereas a void agreement denotes an agreement, which does not fulfill the essentials of
a valid contract.
5. In case of a voidable contract, a person is entitled to compensation for loss or damages
suffered by him on account of the non-performance of contract. But in a void agreement, as it is
unenforceable at law there does not arise any question of compensation due to the non-
performance of the agreement.
Unlawful Agreements
There are certain agreements which are ""unlawful"" in the sense that the law forbid the very
act, the doing of which is contemplated by the agreement. For eg, an agreement to commit a
crime or a tort. To distinguish an unlawful agreement from other void agreement, it is stated
that while in case of void agreement a collateral transaction may not also be avoid, but in case ofan unlawful agreement, the collateral transaction is held to be void. For eg, A gives money to B
to enable him to pay his wagering debt. The wager is the main transaction which is void, but loan
given by A is subsidiary to it, which is not void and A can recover his money from B. On the
other hand, where A gives loan to B to smuggle goods. Smuggling is the main transaction and
loan is subsidiary to it. But, loan transaction is also said to be tainted with the same illegality and
A will not be able to recover his money.","Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

                <li>
                    A voidable contract is one that is enforceable by law at the

                <li>
                    A voidable contract can be enforced or rejected by one of
                    the parties, while a void agreement cannot be enforced by
                    any party.

                <li>
                    The issue in a voidable contract is rectifiable, whereas a
                    void agreement is invalid from the beginning and its flaws
                    are not rectifiable.

                <li>
                    A voidable contract remains valid until the party with the

                </li>
                <li>
                    A voidable contract involves a situation where one party's
                    consent is not freely given, while a void agreement fails to
                    meet the essential criteria of a valid contract.

                    In a voidable contract, the aggrieved party can claim
                    damages for non-performance, whereas in a void agreement,
                    there is no basis for claiming damages due to its
                    unenforceability.

                <li>
                    Unlawful agreements are those that the law prohibits due to
                    the nature of the act involved, such as agreements to commit

                    Unlike void agreements, where a collateral transaction may
                    not be void, in unlawful agreements, the collateral

"Proposal or Offer
The term ""proposal"" has been defined in Section 2(a) of the act, as ""when one person
signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to
obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal"". For
eg- A's willingness to sell his radio set to B for Rs- 5()() with intention to consent of B, But if a
statement is made without any intention to obtain the assent of the other party thereto, that
cannot be termed as proposal
Elements of proposal
•Expression of willingness to do or abstain from doing something
•Made with the object of obtaining assent of the other
Thus the person making the proposal is called the 'proposer', or 'offeror' or 'promisor' and the
person to whom the proposal is made is called as the 'proposee', or 'offeree', or 'promisee'.","Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

"OfTers must be communicated
Section 2(a) of the Act explains that a person is said to make a proposal ""when he signifies to
another person his willingness to do or to abstain from doing something"". The emphasis, here, is
upon the requirement that the willingness to make a proposal should be ""signified"". The terms
signify means to or communicate to make known. It thus requires that the ofter must be
communicated to the other person.
Express or Implied offerOffer is either express or implied. When the offer is made by express communication then the
offer is said to be an express offer. The express offer can be either in words or in written
format. Whereas when the offer is not communicated expressly but communicated by
conduct or by the circumstances of the case, the offer is called an implied offer. For eg. A
says to B that he will sell his bike to B for Rs.30, it is an express offer. For eg, a bid at
an auction is an implied offer.
Completion of Communication
S. 4 The communication of a proposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the
person to whom it is made. An offer cannot be accepted unless and until it has been brought to
the knowledge of the person to whom it is made. For eg. A cannot be said to make an offer to B
unless A brings the offer to the knowledge of B. Thus, acting in ignorance of an offer does not
amount to acceptance of the offer. In Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt, The plaintiff was in
defendants service as a servant. The defendant's nephew absconded and the plaintiff went to find
the missing boy. In the plaintiffs absence, the defendant issued handbills, offering a reward of
Rs 501 to anyone who might find the boy. The plaintiff traced him and claimed the reward. The
plaintiff did not know of the handbills when he found the boy. The court held that the plaintiff
was not entitled to a reward. If the person has the knowledge of the offer, his acting in
accordance with the terms thereof amounts to the acceptance of the same. In such a case, it is
immaterial that at the time of accepting the offer, the acceptor does not intend to claim the
reward mentioned in the offer.","Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

"Intention to Contract
In order that an offer, after acceptance, can result in valid contract, it is necessary that the
offer should be made with an intention to create legal relationship. Promise in case of social
engagements is generally without an intention to create legal relationships. Such an agreement,
therefore, cannot be considered to be a contract. For eg. An agreement to go for movies, for a
walk, to play some game, cannot be enforced in a court of law. The test to know the intention of
the parties is objective and subjective, merely because the promisor contends that there was no
intention to crate legal obligation would not exempt him from the liability. In Balfour v Balfour,
Mr. Balflour who was employed on a government job in Ceylon, went to England with his wife
on leave. For health reasons the Wife was unable to accompany the husband again to Ceylon. The
husband promised to pay 30 euros per month to his wife until she rejoined him in Ceylon. The
husband failed to pay her the said amount hence the wife sued him for the amount, The court
held that the husband was not liable as there was no intention to create a legal relationship.
Intention of the parties to be gathered from the terms of the contract and surrounding
circumstances. Generally in all social matters it is presumed there is no intention to create legal
relation, But in business matters it is presumed to intend such relation. In Jones v. Padavatton,
A divorced daughter lived in Washington with her son who employed on attractive terms and
her mother living in Trinidad, who wished to live near the lady as she was attached to grandson
so she the daughter much against her will to leave the job, take legal education in
England & finally come back to Trinidad as practicing lawyer and mother agreed to pay all
expenses, purchased a house in England, part of it was rented out & a part was allowed to her
daughter and for 5 long years daughter could not complete law, in the meantime she got
remanied and differences arose between mother & daughter and mother stopped payments &also
commenced eviction proceedings. It was held that there was no intention to create a legal
relationship and gave possession to the mother.Offer may be general or specific
When the offer is made to a specific or ascenained person, it is known as specific offer. It
can be only accepted by the person to whom the offer is made or to the person duly
authorized by him. When the same is made to any particular person but to the public at large,
it is known as general offer. A general offer can be accepted by any person. Illustration 'A'
advertises in the newspaper that whosoever finds his missing son would be rewarded with 2
lakh. 'B' reads it and after finding the boy, he calls 'A' to inform about his missing son. Now
VA' is entitled to pay 2 lakh to 'B' for his reward. In Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke ball Co., The
smoke ball company offered by advertisement a reward of $100 as reward to anyone who
contacted influenza after having used the Smoke Ball with the printed directions. Mrs.CarIiII
(plaintiff) relying on the advertisement purchased a smoke ball from a chemist, used the
same in accordance with the directions of the defendants, but still caught influenza. She sued
the defendant to claim the reward of $100 advertised by them. There may be general offer. and acceptance of the general offer may not be communicated. By fulfilling the conditions of
such offer the offeree is said to accept the offer.
Offer and Invitation to offer (treat)
A proposal or an offer has to be distinguished from an invitation to offer or treat. A person
may not offer to sell his goods, but makes some statement or give some information with a view
to inviting others to make offers on that basis. For eg. Displaying goods or dress or books in
window of the shop. This is an invitation to offer. It is on the discretion of the shopkeeper if he
wants to sell his article or not. An invitation to offer is not the final willingness but the interest of
the party to invite the public to offer him. In Harris v. Nickerson, The detendant advertised a
sale by auction. The plaintiff travelled to the advertised place of auction to find that the
defendant had cancelled the auction sale. He brought an action against the defendant to recover
the expenses of his travel. It was held that he was not entitled to the same as there was ms yet no
contract between the two parties, which could make the defendant liable.","Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

"Definition and Essentials of CONTRACT
A Contract is an agreement enforceable by law. An agreement is enforceable by law, if it
is made by the free consent of the parties who are competent to contract and the agreement
is made with a lawful object and is for a lawful consideration, and is not hereby expressly
declared to be void. The agreement which is not enforceable by law is not called contract.
Eg. An agreement to sell a radio set may be a contract, but an agreement to go to see a
movie may be a mere agreement not enforceable by law.
Agreement + Enforceability at law = Contract

        </li>
        <li>
            For an agreement to be enforceable, it must be made with the free
            consent of parties who are competent to contract, have a lawful
            object, lawful consideration, and not be expressly declared void by

"Definition of AGREEMENT
According to S. 2 (e) ""Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration
for each other, is an agreement"". In an agreement there is a promise from both sides. Eg. A
promises to deliver his watch to B and in retuni B Promises to pay a sum of Rs. to A.
There is said to be an agreement between A and B. A promise is the result of an ofter by
one person and its acceptance by the other. Section 2(b) of the Act, defines ""promise"" as
""When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is
said to be accepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise.""
S.IO What agreements are contracts?
All agreements are contracts if they are made
• Between Two persons
Free consent of parties
Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the
same sense. Consent is free when it is not caused by mistake, misrepresentation, undue
influence, fraud or coercion. When consent is caused by any of above said elements, the
contract is voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so caused.
Competent to contract
Competent to contract means the legal ability of a to enter into a valid contract.
Every person is competent to contract who (a) is of the age of majority according to the
law to which he is subject and (b) is of sound mind and (c) is not otherwise disqualified
from contracting by any law to which he is subject.
Lawful consideration and lawful object
An agreement where the object or the consideration is unlawful is void. Object or
consideration is unlawful if it is forbidden by law, it defeats the provisions of law; or is
fraudulent, or involves injuty to the person or property of another; or is immoral; or is
opposed to public policy. Besides the above said agreements, certain agreements have
been expressly declared to be void by the Contract Act such as — wagering agreements,
agreement with uncertain meaning, agreements where consideration is unlawful in part
etc.
Are not hereby expressly declared to be void.
The agreement entered into must not be which the law declares to be either illegal or
void. An illegal agreement is an agreement expressly or impliedly prohibited by law. A
void agreement is one without any legal effects.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

"Different types of agreements
Void Agreements
An agreement not enforceable by law is said to be void. For eg. an agreement by a minor
has been held to be void. Section 24 to 30 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, makes
specific mention of agreements which are void. Those agreements include an agreement.
without consideration, an agreement, in restraint Of marriage, and an agreement in
restraint of trade.
Voidable Contracts
An agreement which is enforceable by law at the option of one or more of the parties
thereto, but not at the option of the other, is a voidable contract. Thus, a voidable
contract is one which could be avoided by one of the parties to the contract at his
option. For eg, when the consent of the party to a contract has been obtained by
coercion, undue influence, fraud and misrepresentation, the contract is voidable at the
option of the party whose consent has been so obtained.
Difference between Void Agreement and Voidable Contract
l. A voidable contract is voidable at the option of one of the parties thereto. But a void
agreement cannot be enforced by any one of the parties thereto.
2. The defect in the case of voidable contract is curable and may be condoned, whereas a void
agreement is void ab initio, and its defects are not curable.
3. A voidable contract does not become void unless the party at whose option it is voidable
repudiates it. But a void agreement is void ab initio.
4. A voidable contract implies a contract, in which the consent of one of the parties to contract is
not free, whereas a void agreement denotes an agreement, which does not fulfill the essentials of
a valid contract.
5. In case of a voidable contract, a person is entitled to compensation for loss or damages
suffered by him on account of the non-performance of contract. But in a void agreement, as it is
unenforceable at law there does not arise any question of compensation due to the non-
performance of the agreement.
Unlawful Agreements
There are certain agreements which are ""unlawful"" in the sense that the law forbid the very
act, the doing of which is contemplated by the agreement. For eg, an agreement to commit a
crime or a tort. To distinguish an unlawful agreement from other void agreement, it is stated
that while in case of void agreement a collateral transaction may not also be avoid, but in case of
an unlawful agreement, the collateral transaction is held to be void. For eg, A gives money to B
to enable him to pay his wagering debt. The wager is the main transaction which is void, but loan
given by A is subsidiary to it, which is not void and A can recover his money from B. On the
other hand, where A gives loan to B to smuggle goods. Smuggling is the main transaction and
loan is subsidiary to it. But, loan transaction is also said to be tainted with the same illegality and
A will not be able to recover his money.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

        <li>
            Sections 24 to 30 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, specify certain
            agreements that are void, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Agreements without consideration

    <strong>
        Voidable Contracts
    </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A voidable contract is an agreement that is enforceable by law at
            the option of one or more parties involved.
        </li>
        <li>
            For instance, if a party's consent to a contract is obtained through
            coercion, undue influence, fraud, or misrepresentation, the contract
            becomes voidable at that party's discretion.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>
        Difference between Void Agreement and Voidable Contract
    </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Voidable Contract:
            </strong>
            A contract that one party can choose to enforce or void.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Void Agreement:
            </strong>
            An agreement that cannot be enforced by any party.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a voidable contract, the defect is fixable, while in a void
            agreement, the defect is permanent.
        </li>
        <li>
            A voidable contract remains valid until the party with the option
            decides to void it, while a void agreement is invalid from the
            beginning.
        </li>
        <li>
            A voidable contract involves a lack of free consent from one party,
            whereas a void agreement lacks the essential elements of a valid
            contract.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a voidable contract, a party can claim damages for
            non-performance, but in a void agreement, there is no such claim due
            to its unenforceability.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>
        Unlawful Agreements
    </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Unlawful agreements are those that are prohibited by law, such as
            agreements to commit a crime or a tort.
        </li>
        <li>
            The key distinction between unlawful agreements and void agreements
            is that in unlawful agreements, the collateral transaction is also
            void.
        </li>
        <li>
            For example, if A lends money to B to pay a wagering debt, the loan
            is valid because it is subsidiary to the void wager.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, if A lends money to B to smuggle goods, both the loan and
            the smuggling agreement are void due to illegality.
        </li>
    </ul>"
"Proposal or Offer
The term ""proposal"" has been defined in Section 2(a) of the act, as ""when one person
signifies to another his willingness to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to
obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal"". For
eg- A's willingness to sell his radio set to B for Rs- 500 with intention to consent of B, But if a
statement is made without any intention to obtain the assent of the other party thereto, that
cannot be termed as proposal.
Elements of proposal
•Expression of willingness to do or abstain from doing something
•Made with the object of obtaining assent of the other
Thus the person making the proposal is called the 'proposer', or 'offeror' or 'promisor' and the
person to whom the proposal is made is called as the 'proposee', or 'offeree', or 'promisee'.

        A proposal, as defined in Section 2(a) of the relevant act, refers to
        the act of one person expressing their willingness to either do or
        refrain from doing something, with the intention of obtaining the
        agreement of another party. For example, when A expresses his
        willingness to sell his radio set to B for Rs. 500, he is making a
        proposal with the expectation of B's consent. However, if a statement is
        made without the intention of seeking the other party's agreement, it
        does not qualify as a proposal.

Section 2(a) of the Act explains that a person is said to make a proposal ""when he signifies to

upon the requirement that the willingness to make a proposal should be ""signified"". The terms

communicated to the other person.
Express or Implied offer
Offer is either express or implied, When the Offer is made by express communication then the
offer is said to be an express offer. The express offer can be either in words or in written
format. Whereas when the offer is not communicated expressly but communicated by
conduct or by the circumstances of the case, the offer is called an implied offer. For eg. A
says to B that he will sell his bike to B for it is an express offer, For eg, a bid at
an auction is an implied offer.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

"Completion of Communication
S. 4 The communication of a proposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the
person to whom it is made. An offer cannot be accepted unless and until it has been brought to
the knowledge of the person to whom it is made. For eg. A cannot be said to make an offer to B
unless A brings the offer to the knowledge of B. Thus, acting in ignorance of an offer does not
amount to acceptance of the offer. In Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt, The plaintiff was in
defendants service as a servant. The defendant's nephew absconded and the plaintiff went to find
the missing boy. In the plaintiffs absence, the defendant issued handbills, offering a reward of
Rs 501 to anyone who might find the boy. The plaintiff traced him and claimed the reward. The
plaintiff did not know of the handbills when he found the boy. The court held that the plaintiff
was not entitled to a reward. If the person has the knowledge of the offer, his acting in
accordance with the terms thereof amounts to the acceptance of the same. In such a case, it is
immaterial that at the time of accepting the offer, the acceptor does not intend to claim the
reward mentioned in the offer.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

                Section 4:
            </strong>
            Communication of a proposal is considered complete when it reaches
            the knowledge of the person to whom it is addressed. An offer cannot
            be accepted unless it is brought to the attention of the intended
            recipient.
        </li>
        <li>
            For example, person A cannot make an offer to person B unless A
            informs B about the offer. Acting without knowledge of an offer does
            not constitute acceptance.

                Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt
            </strong>
            , the court ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to a reward
            because he was unaware of the defendant's offer when he found the
            missing boy. If a person is aware of the offer and acts according to
            its terms, it amounts to acceptance, regardless of their intention
            to claim the reward at that moment.
        </li>
    </ul>"
"Intention to Contract
In order that an offer, after acceptance, can result in valid contract, it is necessary that the
offer should be made with an intention to create legal relationship. Promise in case of social
engagements is generally without an intention to create legal relationships. Such an agreement,
therefore, cannot be considered to be a contract. For eg. An agreement to go for movies, for a
walk, to play some game, cannot be enforced in a court of law. The test to know the intention of
the parties is objective and subjective, merely because the promisor contends that there was no
intention to crate legal obligation would not exempt him from the liability. In Balfour v Balfour,
Mr. Balflour who was employed on a government job in Ceylon, went to England with his wife
on leave. For health reasons the Wife was unable to accompany the husband again to Ceylon. The
husband promised to pay 30 euros per month to his wife until she rejoined him in Ceylon. The
husband failed to pay her the said amount hence the Wife sued him for the amount. The court
held that the husband was not liable as there was no intention to create a legal relationship.
Intention of the parties to be gathered from the terms of the contract and surrounding
circumstances. Generally in all social matters it is presumed there is no intention to create legal
relation. But in business matters it is presumed to intend such relation. In Jones v. Padavatton,
A divorced daughter lived in Washington with her son who employed on attractive terms and
her mother living in Trinidad, who wished to live near the lady as she was attached to grandson
so she persuaded the daughter much against her will to leave the job, take legal education in
England & finally come back to Trinidad as practicing lawyer and mother agreed to pay all
expenses, purchased a house in England, part of it was rented out & a part was allowed to her
daughter and for 5 long years daughter could not complete law, in the meantime she got
remarried and differences arose between mother & daughter and mother stopped payments &also
commenced eviction proceedings. It was held that there was no intention to create a legal
relationship and gave possession to the mother.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

            Intention to Contract

    <ul>
        <li>
            For a valid contract to arise from an offer and acceptance, it is
            essential that the offer is made with the intention to create a
            legal relationship.
        </li>
        <li>
            In social engagements, promises are typically made without the
            intention to create legal obligations, making such agreements
            unenforceable in a court of law.
        </li>
        <li>
            Examples of social engagements include agreements to go to the
            movies, take a walk, or play a game together.
        </li>
        <li>
            The determination of the parties' intention is both objective and
            subjective.

            The case of
            <strong>
                Balfour v Balfour
            </strong>
            illustrates this principle. In this case, Mr. Balfour, working in
            Ceylon, promised to pay his wife 30 euros per month while she stayed
            in England for health reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
            When he failed to make the payments, his wife sued him, but the
            court ruled that there was no intention to create a legal
            relationship, and thus he was not liable.
        </li>
        <li>
            The intention of the parties can be inferred from the contract's
            terms and the surrounding circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generally, in social matters, it is presumed that there is no

            <strong>
                Jones v. Padavatton
            </strong>
            further illustrates this point. In this case, a divorced daughter
            was persuaded by her mother to leave her job in Washington, study
            law in England, and eventually return to Trinidad as a practicing
            lawyer.

        <li>
            The mother agreed to cover all expenses and purchased a house in

            daughter.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, after five years of the daughter being unable to complete
            her law degree and facing personal changes, the mother stopped
            payments and initiated eviction proceedings.
        </li>
        <li>
            The court ruled that there was no intention to create a legal
            relationship, and the mother was granted possession of the property.
        </li>
    </ul>"
"Offer may be general or specific
When the offer is made to a specific or ascenained person, it is known as specific offer. It
can be only accepted by the person to whom the offer is made or to the person duly
authorized by him. When the same is made to any particular person but to the public at large,
it is known as general offer. A general offer can be accepted by any person. Illustration 'A'
advertises in the newspaper that whosoever finds his missing son would be rewarded with 2
lakh. 'B' reads it and after finding the boy, he calls 'A' to inform about his missing son. Now
'A' is entitled to pay 2 lakh to 'B' for his reward. In Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke ball Co., The
smoke ball company offered by advertisement a reward of $100 as reward to anyone who
contacted influenza after having used the Smoke Ball with the printed directions. Mrs.Carlill
(plaintiff) relying on the advertisement purchased a smoke ball from a chemist, used the
same in accordance with the directions of the defendants, but still caught influenza. She sued
the defendant to claim the reward of $100 advertised by them. There may be general offer
and acceptance of the general offer may not be communicated. By fulfilling the conditions of
such offer the offeree is said to accept the offer.
Offer and Invitation to offer (treat)
A proposal or an offer has to be distinguished from an invitation to offer or treat. A person
may not offer to sell his goods, but makes some statement or give some information with a view
to inviting others to make offers on that basis. For eg. Displaying goods or dress or books in
window of the shop. This is an invitation to offer. It is on the discretion of the shopkeeper if he
wants to sell his article or not. An invitation to offer is not the final willingness but the interest of
the party to invite the public to offer him. In Harris v. Nickerson, The detendant advertised a
sale by auction. The plaintiff travelled to the advertised place of auction to find that the
defendant had cancelled the auction sale. He brought an action against the defendant to recover
the expenses of his travel. It was held that he was not entitled to the same as there was ms yet no
contract between the two parties, which could make the defendant liable.

"DEFINITION OF 'ACCEPTANCE'
S. 2(b) When the person to whom the prom-)sal is made signifies his assent thereto, the
offer is said to be accepted. Thus the proposal when accepted becomes a promise."" An offer can
be revoked before it is accepted. As specified in the definition, if the offer is accepted
unconditionally by the offeree to whom the request is made, it will amount to acceptance.
Acceptance may be express or implied
where acceptance is made with words sm»ken or written, it is an express acceptance, and if
acceptance is made otherwise than in words, it is implied. What is necessary is that there should
be some external manifestation of acceptance.
Who Can Accept?
Offers can either be made out to people in General or to a Specific counter-party If it is

A contract is created only after an offer is accepted. Before the acceptance is made neither
party is bound thereby. At that stage offerror is free to revoke or withdraw his offer, and the
offeree is free not to accept the offer or to Rject the same. After the offer has been accepted it
become a promise which, if other conditions of a valid contract are satisfied, bind both the
parties to promise. After acceptance, each party becomes legally bound by the promise made by
him through the medium of offer and acceptance of it.

accepted, it will count as a counteroffer. Also, it must be expressed in a prescribed manner. If no
such prescribed manner is described then it must be expressed in the normal and reasonable manner,
i.e. as it would be in the normal course of business. Implied acceptance can also be given through
some conduct, act, etc. However, the law does not allow silence to be a form of acceptance. So the
offeror cannot say if no answer is received the offer will be deemed as accepted. In Hyde v.
Wrench, There was an offer made by A and B for the sale of a Farm for pounds. B rejected
this offer and said that he will pay only 950 pounds to which A did not agree. Thereupon B said
that he was willing to pay pounds to which also A did not agree. B sued A and contended
that there was a contract by which by which A was bound. It was held that B had once rejected
A's oflér by his counter offer to pay 950 pounds and this made the original offer to lapse, and
therefore, no contract had resulted in this case.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

"Acceptance should be expressed in usual/ prescribed manner
According to S.7 (2), the acceptance must be ""expressed in some usual or reasonable manner,
unless the proposal prescribed the manner in which it is to be accepted."" It means that if the manner
of acceptance has been pmscribed by the proposal, the acceptance has to be made in that prescribed
manner, otherwise the same may be made in some usual or reasonable manner.
Usual or Reasonable manner
Usual or Reasonable manner of acceptance means the manner which is usually adopted in a
particular kind of transaction according to the usage or custom of trade. Acceptance by post,
telegram, telephone, or through personal messenger may be considered to be usual manner of
acceptance.
Prescribed manner
If the proposal prescribes any particular manner of acceptance, the acceptance must be made in that
manner. The manner of acceptance may include the requirement of fulfillment of certain conditions,
such as the payment of an advance. If such conditions are not fulfilled, there does not arise a valid
contract.
Acceptance should be made while the offer is still subsisting
Already it has been noted that the offeror is free 10 withdraw the offer, or the offer is revoked
under various circumstances mentioned in S.6. After the offer has been withdrawn or has lap.secl,
there is nothing which can be accepted. It is, therefore, necessary that the acceptance should be
made while the offer is still alive and subsisting. Acceptance after the lapse of the offer cannot give
rise to a contract. Similarly, the offer is deemed to have ended by rejection of the original offer or a
counter offer.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

"Revocation of Offer and Acceptance
Revocation of Offer
It is only after the acceptance of an offer that there arises a contract and then both the panies
become bound by their promises. Before the offer has been accepted, it can be revoked.
After the ofTer has been accepted it ripens into a contract and then it cannot revoked.
Modes of revocation of offer
Modes of revocation of offer
S .6 mentions various modes of revocation of offer
Notice of Revocation
Lapse of time,
•
Failure to accept wndition precedent
Death or insanity of offeror
Revocation by Notice
It may be revokecl at any time before it is accepted. The proposal may be revoked by the
communication of notice of revocation which has to be communicated by the proposer or his agent
and not by anybody else. In India, the notice of revocation has to be communicated by the proposer
only, whereas in England the offer stands revoked even though the offeree comes to know about the
revocation of the offer through some other source and not by a notice by the offeror himself.
By lapse of time
A proposal is revoked by the lapse of the time prescribed in such proposal for its acceptance, or,
if no time is prescribed, by the lapse of a reasonable time. Sometimes the party may expressly fix
the time up to which the offer will remain open. An offeror, who has mentioned that his offer is
open until a particular time, is not debarred from revoking the offer earlier than that time, if he so
likes. For eg. if A has made an offer to sell his property to B for certain price, also stating that the
offer is open till 12th June, 9:00 a.m. the offer would be revoked on 11th June if on that date A
disposes of the property to somebody else with notice to B. An attempt on part of B to accept this
offer on 12th June (before 9:()() a.m.) will be of no avail as the offer has already been revoked.
Similarly, expressly 'ejecting an offer even before the lapse of a fixed or reasonable time makes
the offer to lapse.
By failure to fulfill a condition precedent
When the offer is subject to some conditions precedent, such a condition has got to be
fulfilled by the acceptor before making the acceptance. If the acceptor fails to fulfill the
condition precedent to acceptance, the offer stands revoked. For example, if the ofter requires the
deposit of some eamest money, or the execution of some document, etc, this condition must be
fulfilled. In State of M.P. v. Goberdhan Nath, Tenders for the sale of certain goods were invited
subject to the condition that 25% amount was to be paid when the tender was accepted. A's
tender was the highest and the same was accepted, but he failed to fulfill this condition. It was
held that no contract had arisen merely because A's tender was accepted. Therefore, if A failed
to take the goods and pay for them, he could not be made liable for the breach of contract.
By death or insanity of the offeror
An offer is revoked by the death or insanity of the offeror, if the fact of his death or insanity
comes to the knowledge of the acceptor before acceptance. In India, the death or insanity of the
offeror does not automatically make the offer to lapse. The offer stands revoked if the fact of
death or insanity comes to the knowledge of the acceptor before acceptance. It means if the fact
of death or insanity has not come to the knowledge of the offeree while he accepts the offer, it is
valid acceptance giving rise to a contractual obligation. Under English Law, death of the offeror
revokes an offer even if acceptance is made in ignorance of the death.
Revocation of Acceptance
S.5 ""An acceptance may be revoked at any time before the communication of the acceptance is
complete as against the acceptor, but not afterwards"". It has already been noted above that when the
contract is created through m»st, according to S.4, by the posting of the letter of acceptance:
• the proposer becomes bound when the letter of acceptance is posted to him,
• but the acceptor becomes bound when the letter of acceptance reaches the proposer.
Since the acceptor does not become bound immediately on posting his letter of acceptance, he is
free to revoke the acceptance by adopting speedier mode of communication, whereby his
communication of revocation of acceptance may teach earlier than his letter of acceptance.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

            The offeror can revoke the offer before the specified time, even if

            before that time.

            If the acceptor is unaware of the offeror's death or insanity at the

            the acceptor is bound by the acceptance.

            In the case of acceptance through post, as per Section 4, the

promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains
from doing, or promises to do or abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or
promise is called a consideration for the promise"". The definition requires the following
essentials to be satisfied in order there is valid consideration-

Consideration to be given 'at the desire of the promisor'.
Consideration to be given 'by the promisee or any other person'.

promise:
(i) Has done or abstained from doing, or
(ii) Does or abstains from doing, or

There should be some act, abstinence or promise by the promise, which constitutes
consideration for the promise.

"Consideration at the desire of the promisor
Consideration must have been given at the desire of the promisor, rather than voluntarily or
at the instance of some third party. Example: A saves B's goods from a fire without being asked
to do so. A cannot demand payment for his service. In Durga Prasad vs. Baldeo, Plaintiff
constructed few shops in a market at the instance of the collector of that place. Defendant
occupied one of the shops in the market. Money for the construction of the market was spent by
the plaintiff, the defendants, in consideration thereof, made a promise to pay to the plaintiff
commission on the articles sold in that market. Defendant failed to pay the promised
commission. Held: Consideration for promise to pay the commission for construction of the
market was not at the desire Of the defendant but on the order Of collector, Therefore, held that
since the consideration did not move at the desire of the defendant they were not liable in respect
of the promise made by them.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

"Subscription for a charitable purpose
A promise to contribute an amount for a charitable purpose may not be enforceable because
against this promise there may be no consideration. But a promise to pay subscription becomes
enforceable when definite steps have been taken on the faith of the promised subscription. In
Kedarnath v. Gorie Mohammed, There was a proposal to construct a Town Hall at Howrah
provided sufficient funds would be available by way of subscription. The defendant was one of
the subscribers, having promised to pay Rs. 100 by signing his name in the subscription book for
the purpose. On the faith of the promised subscriptions, the plaintiff engaged a contractor for the
purpose of the construction and started a construction work. The defendant refused to pay his
subscription on the ground that he was not legally bound by his promise because there was no
consideration for the same. Held: That engaging a contractor and starting the construction on the
faith of the promise was sufficient consideration to enforce the promise and, therefore, the
defendant was bound to pay the amount promised by him.
Consideration by promisee or any other person
According to Indian law consideration may be given by the promisee or any other person.
In India there is a possibility that the consideration for the promise may move not from the
promisee but a third person, who is not a party to the contract. Thus, as long as there is a
consideration for a promise, it is immaterial who has furnished it. It may move from the
promisee or from any other person. In English law, consideration should move from
promisee only. In Chinnaya vs. Ramaya, A, an old lady, granted an estate to her daughter
(defendant) with a direction that the daughter should pay an annuity of Rs. 653/- to A's
brother (plaintiff). On the same day the defendant made a promise to the plaintiff that she
would pay the annuity as directed by A. The defendant failed to pay the stipulated sum. In an
action against her by the plaintiff she contended that since the plaintiff himself had fumished
no consideration, The Madras High Court held that in this agreement between the
and plaintiff, the consideration has been furnished by the defendant mother and that is
enough consideration to enforce the promise between the plaintiff and the defendant.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

            A promise to contribute a specific amount for a charitable purpose

            There was a proposal to construct a Town Hall in Howrah, contingent
            upon gathering sufficient funds through subscriptions. The defendant
            was among the subscribers, having pledged to pay a certain amount by
            signing the subscription book.
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
            The defendant later refused to fulfill his subscription, arguing
            that he was not legally obligated due to the absence of
            consideration.

        <li>
            <strong>
                Ruling:
            </strong>
            The court determined that hiring a contractor and commencing
            construction based on the promise constituted adequate consideration
            to enforce the subscription. Consequently, the defendant was legally
            bound to honor his commitment.

            Consideration by Promisee or Any Other Person
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In Indian law, consideration for a promise can be provided by the
            promisee or by any other person. It is not necessary for the
            consideration to come solely from the promisee, as long as there is
            some consideration involved.
        </li>
        <li>
            This differs from English law, where consideration must come from
            the promisee only. In India, even if a third party who is not a
            party to the contract provides the consideration, it is still valid.
        </li>
        <li>
            A case that illustrates this principle is
            <strong>
                Chinnaya vs. Ramaya
            </strong>
            . In this case, an old lady (A) granted an estate to her daughter
            (the defendant) with the condition that the daughter would pay an
            annuity to A's brother (the plaintiff). The defendant promised to
            pay the annuity to the plaintiff as directed by A.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the defendant failed to make the payment, the plaintiff sued
            her. The defendant argued that since the plaintiff did not provide
            any consideration, the agreement was not valid.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, the Madras High Court ruled that the consideration in the
            agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff came from A, the
            mother, and this was sufficient to enforce the promise.
        </li>
    </ul>"
"Privity of Contract
The doctrine of privity of contract means that only those persons who are parties to the
contract can enforce the same; a stranger to the contract cannot enforce a contract even though
the contract may have been entered into for his benefit. Example: If in a contract between A and
B some benefit has been conferred upon X, X cannot file a suit to enforce the contract because A
and B are the only parties to the contract whereas X is only a stranger to the contract. In India a
may not have himself given any consideration but he can enforce the contract if he is a
party to the contract, because according to the Indian Law consideration may be given either by
the promisee or even a third patty. That does not affect the rule of privity of contract.
English Law
Dutton Vs. Poole, A intended to sell his wood to make a provision for the marriage
expenses of his daughter. The defendant, A's son requested A not to sell the wood and in
return made a promise to his father that he would pay pounds to A's daughter, The
father forebore to sell the wood but the defendant did not pay the promised amount to the
plaintiff. Held: It is true that the defendant, promised to father and father furnished
consideration for the promise. The plaintiff, was neither privy to the contract nor to the
consideration. But it was equally clear that the whole object of the agreement was to
provide a portion to the plaintiff. It would have been highly inequitable to allow the son
to keep the wood and yet to deprive his sister of her portion. He was accordingly liable. A
person, Who is not a party to the contract but is intended to be the beneficiary under the
contract and is nearly related to the promisee, has a right of action.
Tweddle Vs. Atkinson, After the marriage of the plaintiff, there was a contract in writing
between the plaintiffs father and the girl's father that each would pay a certain sum of
money to the plaintiff and the plaintiff would have a right to sue for such sums. Plaintiff
brought an action against girl's father to recover the promised amount. Held: Plaintiff
could not sue for the same. As the plaintiff was both a stranger to the contract as well as
stranger to consideration and he could not enforce the claim. It laid foundation for
doctrine of ""privity of contract"" which means that a contract is a contract between the
parties only and no third person can sue upon it even if it is made for his benefit.
Two fundamental principles
Consideration must move from promisee and promisee only. If consideration moved
from any person other than promisee then promisee becomes stranger to the contract
as such he cannot enforce the contract
A contract cannot be enforced by a person who is not a party to contract even though
it is made for his benefit. He is a stranger to contract and hence can claim no rights
under it.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

            Doctrine of Privity of Contract

    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The doctrine of privity of contract states that only the parties
            involved in a contract have the right to enforce it. A person who is
            not a party to the contract cannot enforce it, even if the contract
            was made for their benefit.
        </li>
        <li>
            For example, if A and B enter into a contract that benefits X, X
            cannot sue to enforce the contract because A and B are the only
            parties involved.
        </li>
        <li>
            In India, a person who is a party to the contract can enforce it
            even if they did not provide any consideration. This is because,
            under Indian law, consideration can be provided by the promisee or a
            third party. However, this does not change the rule of privity of
            contract.

        <li>
            After the plaintiff's marriage, a written contract between the
            plaintiff's father and the girl's father stipulated that each would
            pay a certain sum of money to the plaintiff.

            The plaintiff had the right to sue for these sums.

        <li>
            When the plaintiff attempted to sue the girl's father to recover the
            promised amount, the court ruled against the plaintiff.
        </li>
        <li>
            The court determined that the plaintiff was a stranger to both the
            contract and the consideration, and therefore could not enforce the
            claim.

        <li>
            This case laid the groundwork for the doctrine of ""privity of
            contract,"" which means that a contract is only between the parties
            involved, and no third party can sue on it, even if the contract is
            made for their benefit.

"Indian law — Privity of Contract
The rule that ""privity of contract"" is needed and a stranger to contract cannot bring an action
is equally applicable in India as in England. Even though under the Indian Contract Act the
definition of consideration is wider than in English Law, yet the common law principle is
generally applicable in India, with the effect, that only a party to the contract is entitled to
enforce the same. In Jamnadas vs. Ramavtar , A had mortgaged some property to X. A sold this
property to B. B having agreed with A to pay off the mortgage debt. X brought an action against
B to recover the mortgage money. It was held by the Privy Council that since there was no
contract between X and B, X could not enforce the contract to recover the amount from B.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

            Privity of Contract in Indian Law

    <ul>
        <li>
            Privity of contract is a legal principle that holds that only
            parties to a contract can enforce its terms and take legal action
            based on it.
        </li>
        <li>
            In India, as in England, this principle is upheld, meaning that a
            stranger to the contract cannot bring a lawsuit to enforce its
            terms.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Indian Contract Act has a broader definition of consideration
            compared to English law. However, the common law principle of
            privity remains applicable in India.
        </li>
        <li>
            An example of privity of contract in action is seen in the case of
            Jamnadas vs. Ramavtar. In this case:
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A mortgaged property to X.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A then sold this property to B, with an agreement that B
                    would pay off the mortgage debt to X.
                </li>
                <li>
                    X attempted to sue B to recover the mortgage money.

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The Privy Council ruled that X could not enforce the contract
            against B because there was no direct contract between them. This
            illustrates the principle of privity of contract, where only parties
            to the contract have the right to enforce its terms.

"Consideration may be past, executed or executory
Indian Contract Act recognizes three kinds of consideration, viz., Past, Executed and Executory.
It says that when at the desire of the promisor, the promise and the other person:
(a) Has done or abstained from doing, ( the consideration is past)
(b) Does or abstains from doing, ( the consideration is executed or present)
(c) Promises to do or to abstain from doing, ( the consideration is Executory or future)
Past Consideration
Past Consideration means that the consideration for any promise was given earlier and the
promise is made thereafter. It is, of course, necessary that at the time the act constituting
consideration was done, it must have been done at the desire of the promisor. For eg. I request
you to find my lost dog. After you have done the same, if I promise to pay you Rs. for that, it
is a case of past consideration. For my promise to pay you Rs.I(K) the consideration is your
efforts in finding my lost dog and the same had been done before I promised to pay the amount.
Here the consideration has been given at my request, because it is only when I request you to
find the dog.
Past services voluntarily rendered
Indian Contract Act recognises only such consideration which has been given at the desire of
the promisor, rather than voluntarily. If consideration has been given voluntarily, it is no
consideration. For example, if my dog has been lost and without any request from me to find the
same, you find that on your own and deliver the dog to me. This is a case of past services
rendered voluntarily. I promise to pay Rs. to you after you have rendered these services,- can
such an agreement been forced ? Yes it comes in the exception.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand.

said to be ""executed"". Executed consideration is different from past consideration — executed
consideration is the consideration provided simultaneously with the making of the contract. In

"Consideration need not be adequate
A contract supported by consideration is valid even though it is inadequate. Explanation II to
section 25, ""An agreement to which the consent of the promisor is freely given is not void
merely because the consideration is inadequate; but the inadequacy of the consideration may be
taken into account by Court in determining the question whether the consent of the promisor was
freely given."" The burden is on the party pleading absence of free consent. Inadequacy of
consideration is by itself is not ground for treating the contract as invalid but it may be a factor
which the court may take into consideration to know whether the consent Of a party was free,
For eg. A agrees to sell a horse worth Rs.l, 000 for Rs.10. A denies that his consent to the
agreement was freely given, The inadequacy of the consideration is a fact which the court should
take into account in considering whether or not A's consent was freely given.
Consideration must be real, of some value
Although it is not necessary that consideration should be adequate, it is, however, necessary
that it should be real and should not be unsubstantial. In White v. Bluett A son used to complain
to his father that his brothers had been given more property than him. The father promised that
he would release the son from a debt if the latter promised stopped complaining. After the
father's death an action was brought by the executors to recover the debt. The son contended that
the father had made a contract to release him from the debt in consideration for his promise not
to bore his father, Held: Promise by son not to bore his father with complaints in future did not
constitute good consideration for the father's promise to release him, and, therefore, the son
continued to be liable for the debt. Promise not to bore the promisor is not enough to constitute consideration.","$#$Paraphrase the above information and give in points.

            Contract Validity and Consideration

    <p>
        Consideration is a crucial element in determining the validity of a
        contract. While it is not necessary for consideration to be adequate, it
        must be real and of some value. The following points elaborate on the
        concepts of consideration and its impact on contract validity:

            Contract Validity with Inadequate Consideration
        </strong>

        <li>
            A contract supported by consideration is considered valid even if
            the consideration is inadequate.
        </li>
        <li>
            According to Explanation 11 to section 25, an agreement is not void
            solely because the consideration is insufficient. However, the
            inadequacy of consideration may be considered by the court to
            determine whether the promisor's consent was freely given.
        </li>
        <li>
            The burden of proving the absence of free consent lies with the
            party making the claim. Inadequacy of consideration alone does not
            make the contract invalid, but it can be a factor in assessing free

            While consideration does not need to be adequate, it must be real

                White v. Bluett
            </strong>
            , a son complained to his father about the unequal distribution of
            property among siblings. The father promised to release the son from
            a debt in exchange for the son's promise to stop complaining. After
            the father's death, the executors sought to recover the debt. The
            son argued that the father had made a contract to release him from
            the debt in consideration for his promise not to annoy the father.
        </li>
        <li>
            The court held that the son's promise not to annoy the father did
            not constitute valid consideration for the father's promise to
            release him from the debt. As a result, the son remained liable for
            the debt.
        </li>
        <li>
            A promise not to annoy the promisor is insufficient to constitute

• Collins v. Godefroy Plaintiff received a summons to give evidence in a case. Thereafter
the defendant, promised to pay to the plaintiff, some money for the trouble which was to
be taken by him in appearing in that case. Plaintiff sued defendant to recover the amount
promised by defendant. Held — Plaintiff having received the summons was already under
a public duty to give evidence, and therefore, the promise by the defendant to pay did not
constitute consideration for the promise.
Performance of Contractual duty
a) Pre-existing contract with the promisor
b) Pre-existing contract with third parties

If the plaintiff is already bound to perform a particular contractual duty owed to the defendant,
his promise to pay something additional for the same promise is no consideration.

"In the previous chapter, we looked at life processes involved in the
 maintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with
 a notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of
 these movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed
 germinates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the
 course of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth
 were to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some
 movements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected
 with growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes
 chewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.
 Why do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible
 answer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the
 environment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has
 seen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt
 by living organisms to use changes in their environment to their
 advantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure
 and fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough
 food so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on
 our eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond
 to it with movement in order to protect ourselves.
 If we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this
 movement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each
 kind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement
 in response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper,
 rather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends
 on the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement
 must be connected to the recognition of various events in the
 environment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other
 words, living organisms must use systems providing control and
 coordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation
 in multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these
 control and coordination activities.",Paraphrase the above information. Make sure the language is not difficult and easy for layman to understand. Do not shorten any information and do not change the basic concept or meaning of the information. ,"<h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
        Have you ever wondered
        <strong>
            what makes something alive?
        </strong>
        One of the easiest clues is
        <strong>
            movement.
        </strong>
        When we see a seed pushing its way through the soil or a cat chasing a
        mouse, we know they’re alive because they’re moving. But here’s the
        important part:
        <strong>
            not all movements are the same.
        </strong>
        Some happen because a plant or animal is growing, while others, like
        kids playing, aren’t about growth at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        So,
        <strong>
            why do living things move?
        </strong>
        It’s all about
        <strong>
            reacting to what’s happening
        </strong>
        around them

            absorb up sunlight,
        </strong>
        and even when we whisper in class instead of shouting, we’re responding
        to what’s around us. These movements aren’t random – they’re carefully
        controlled to help living things survive and thrive. To do this, every
        living creature has special systems inside them that make sure they
        respond just the right way to what’s going on in their world.

" ANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM
 In animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and
 muscular tissues, which we have studied in Class IX. Touching a hotobject is an urgent and dangerous
 situation for us. We need to detect it,
 and respond to it. How do we detect that
 we are touching a hot object? All
 information from our environment is
 detected by the specialised tips of some
 nerve cells. These receptors are usually
 located in our sense organs, such as the
 inner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so
 on. So gustatory receptors will detect taste
 while olfactory receptors will detect smell.
 This information, acquired at the
 end of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell
 [Fig. 7.1 (a)], sets off a chemical reaction
 that creates an electrical impulse. This
 impulse travels from the dendrite to the
 cell body, and then along the axon to its
 end. At the end of the axon, the electrical
 impulse sets off the release of some
 chemicals. These chemicals cross the
 gap, or synapse, and start a similar
 electrical impulse in a dendrite of the next
 neuron. This is a general scheme of how
 nervous impulses travel in the body. A
 similar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to
 other cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 7.1 (b)].
 (a)
 (b)
 Figure 7.1 (a) Structure of neuron, (b) Neuromuscular junction
 It is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised
 network of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting
 information via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.
 Look at Fig. 7.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where
 information is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an
 electrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a
 chemical signal for onward transmission.","Paraphrase the above information and make language easy for layman to understand. If headings are given, do not change it. ","<h2>

            Animals - Nervous System
        </strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        In animals, the nervous and muscular tissues are responsible for
        regulating and coordinating body functions.  Our bodies have specialized
        cells called
        <strong>
            receptors,
        </strong>
        which act like tiny sensors at the ends of nerves to gather information
        from our surroundings. These receptors are mainly located in our sense
        organs—like the inner ear, nose, and tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Gustatory Receptors:
            </strong>
            These receptors are found on the tongue and help us detect different
            tastes. For instance, they tell us whether something is sweet, sour,
            salty, or bitter.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Olfactory Receptors:
            </strong>
            Located in the nose, these receptors pick up different smells. When
            you smell something like freshly baked cookies or a flower, these
            receptors send information to your brain about the scent.

        The nervous system controls and coordinates bodily actions in animals.
        It consists of the brain, spinal cord, and a network of nerves. The
        system is responsible for

"What happens in Reflex Actions?
 ‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden
 action in response to something in the environment. We say ‘I jumped
 out of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the
 flame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.
 What exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that
 we do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control
 of our reactions. Yet these are situations where we are responding with
 some action to changes in our environment. How is control and
 coordination achieved in such situations?
 Let us consider this further. Take one of our examples. Touching a
 flame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any
 animal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to
 think consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,
 and therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long
 will it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If
 nerve impulses are sent around the way we have talked about earlier,
 then thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.
 Thinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated
 interaction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.
 If this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our
 body consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits
 in the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the
 body which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in
 order to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull
 must be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.
 Similarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves
 must carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is
 to be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to
 get burnt!
 How does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than
 having to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat
 were to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,
 the process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by
 an output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is
 commonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 7.2). Where should such reflex arc
 connections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?
 The best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet
 each other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal
 cord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord
 itself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.
 Of course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking
 process of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very
 little or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is
 quite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning
 in the absence of true thought processes.  However, even after complex
 neuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be
 more efficient for quick responses.

 light is focussed on your eyes?","Paraphrase the above information and give in points and make language easy for layman to understand. If headings or sub headings are given, do not change it. ","<h3>

"Human Brain
 Is reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since
 we know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves
 which supply information to think about. Thinking involves more
 complex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated
 in the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The
 brain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system. They receive
 information from all parts of the body and integrate it.
 We also think about our actions. Writing, talking, moving a chair,
 clapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions
 which are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to
 send messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous
 system communicates with the muscles.  The communication between
 the central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated
 by the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising
 from the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain
 thus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you
 will expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different
 parts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.
 The brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,
 mid-brain and hind-brain.
 The fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions
 which receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas
 of the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There
 are separate areas of association where this sensory information is
 interpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors
 as well as with information that is already stored in the brain.  Based on
all this, a decision is made about how to respond and the information is
 passed on to the motor areas which control the movement of voluntary
 muscles, for example, our leg muscles.  However, certain sensations are
 distinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we
 have eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre
 associated with  hunger, which is in a separate part of the fore-brain
Study the labelled diagram of the human brain. We have seen that
 the different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function
 of each part?
 Let us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked
 about in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like
 without our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it.
 In fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them
 even if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe
 or digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in
 the size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a
 chair, there is another set of muscle movements over which we do not
 have any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are
 controlled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions
 including blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the
 medulla in the hind-brain.
 Think about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,
 picking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain
 called the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions
 and maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what
 would happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not
 thinking about it.","Paraphrase the above information and give in points and make language easy for layman to understand. If headings or sub headings are given, do not change it. ","<h3>

" How are these Tissues protected?
 A delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of
 activities, needs to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed
 so that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is
 contained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock
 absorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you
 will feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or
 backbone which protects the spinal cord.
 7.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?
 So far, we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects
 information, sends it around the body, processes information, makes
 decisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for
 action. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,
 muscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When
 a nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How
 does a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular
 level is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they
 shorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?
 The answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle
 cells have special proteins that change both their shape and their
 arrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When
 this happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells
 a shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in
 Class IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles
 and involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far, what
 do you think the differences between these would be","Paraphrase the above information and give in points and make language easy for layman to understand. If headings or sub headings are given, do not change it. ","<h3>

"12.1 Stars and Constellations
At night, when we look up at the sky, we see
many stars. Some stars are bright and others
are dim. Stars shine with their own light.
Some groups of stars appear to form
patterns which are like shapes of familiar
things. Long ago, when watching stars in
the night sky was a favourite pastime of our

ancestors, they identified these star patterns with animals,
things or characters in stories. Many cultures had names
for patterns based on their own stories. These imaginary
shapes helped them in recognising stars in the sky.
Recognising stars and their patterns was a useful skill
for navigation in the olden times. Before the arrival of
modern technology or even before the invention of the
magnetic compass, it helped people, particularly sailors
and travellers, in finding directions at sea or on land. It is
still used in emergencies as a backup method.
In earlier times, groups of stars forming patterns were
called constellations. Currently, the regions of sky, which
include these groups of stars, are defined as constellations.
However, since in constellations, the patterns of stars are
often the most prominent, the term constellation is still
commonly used for these groups of stars.Some constellations are shown in Fig. 12.3. The stars
are joined by imaginary lines, drawn for easy identification.
The constellation Orion is often represented as a hunter.
There are three stars in the middle, which represent the belt
of the hunter. Some people imagine that the hunter Orion,
followed by his dog (constellation Canis Major), is battling
a bull (constellation Taurus). Canis Major contains a star
called Sirius, which is the brightest star in the night sky
(Fig. 12.3).Two distinct patterns of stars, the Big Dipper and the
Little Dipper, are shown in Fig. 12.4. The Pole Star or Polaris,
which is part of the Little Dipper is also shown (Fig. 12.4).
The Pole Star appears stationary in the North direction,
which helps to locate the North direction in the Northern
hemisphere.",Paraphrase the above information and give in points. Give language for layman to understand and do not change the headings or sub headings if given. ,"<h2>

"12.2 Night Sky Watching
If it is a clear cloudless night, a large number of stars may be
visible in the sky. If you stay in a big city, you may find that
the sky is rarely clear and only a few stars are seen in the
night sky. This is due to light pollution, smoke and dust. The
presence of excessive artificial light at night time is referred
to as light pollution. In villages or areas where there is less
light pollution, a larger number of stars can be seen. Also,
your house may be surrounded by tall buildings and trees,
which may block your view. The night sky is best viewed
from open dark areas.
Light pollution is growing sharply globally. This is reducing our
ability to enjoy and study objects in the night sky. Some
Do you
know?
dark sky reserves and parks have been established
around the world. Light pollution in the reserves is
controlled to preserve dark skies for research. There
are a few organisations which are working to educate
people about reducing light pollution.
Can we try to lind
any constellation
or star of our
choice on any
night from our
location?
Not all stars and constellations are visible from
all places on Earth and on all nights in a year.
For example, the Pole Star is not visible from
the southern hemisphere of Earth. To identify
a star or a constellation, you need to know
how a particular constellation looks like
and where to look for it in the night sky. To
get familiar with the pattern of a constellation
you may use images such as Fig. 12.3 and Fig. 12.4.
To find out when and in which portion of the sky a star or
a constellation will be visible from your location, you may
take the help of sky mapping apps that can be downloaded
on a mobile phone, or other online resources.Preparation for night sky watching
Under the guidance of adults, identify a dark open area
for night sky watching. This should be away from lights,
tall buildings and trees.
Choose the date and time based upon what you plan to
identify in the night sky.
Choose a moonless night with no clouds, particularly
for the Pole Star which is not very bright.
It may be useful to have access to a mobile app with a
sky map, or print out images of the constellations you
plan to view. You may also carry a magnetic compass
to find directions and a notebook to note or draw your
observations.
On the particular day and time selected, go to the
identified place with an adult, where the night sky
watching is to be done.
After reaching there, wait for about half an hour for
your eyes to get adjusted to the darkness. This will
help you to see the night sky better (Fig. 12.5).

        <li>
            Light pollution happens when there is too much artificial light at

            you can see many more stars. Sometimes, tall buildings and trees
            around your house can also block your view of the night sky. The
            best places to see the night sky are open and dark areas with little

"Planets
A planet is a large, nearly spherical object that revolves
around the Sun. Our Earth is a planet as it revolves around
the Sun as shown in Fig. 12.7. The Earth takes nearly one
year to complete one revolution. Like the Earth, there are
other planets that revolve around the Sun.
While revolving around the Sun, the Earth is also
rotating about its axis. ror one full rotation. the

The eight planets, in order of their increasing distance
from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (Fig. 12.7).
The inner four planets nearest to the Sun—Mercury,
Venus, Earth and Mars—are smaller in size. They have solid
surfaces with rocks on them.Venus is usually seen shining brightly at dawn and dusk,
and is commonly called the Morning Star or the Evening
Star, even though it is not a star. Mars is called the Red Planet
because it appears red. This is because the soil on Mars is
reddish in colour.
A large portion of the Earth's surface is covered with
water and thus, it appears blue from the space. Due to this,
the Earth is also called the Blue Planet.
The four outermost planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune—are much larger compared to the Earth, and are
mostly made of gases. These giant gaseous planets have
large flat ring-like structures around them which are made
of dust particles and rocky material.
Planets get most of their energy from the Sun. So,
the farther they are, the colder they are in general. The
presence of an atmosphere on a planet can trap heat which
can significantly change the temperature of a planet. That is
why Venus, for example, is hotter than Mercury, although it
is farther from the Sun.There is another object called Pluto that lies farther than Neptune,
and revolves around the Sun. It is smaller than the Earth's
Moon. When it was discovered, it was called a planet of the Solar
System. But later, when similar more small objects
were discovered, the International Astronomical
Union (IAU) in 2006 redefined the requirements of
an Object to be called a planet. As per this definition, More to

"Natural Satellites
Objects that move around planets are commonly called
satellites. They are smaller in size than planets. Moons are
natural satellites of planets. The Earth has one Moon, while
Mars has two moons. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
have a large number of moons.
In general, any Object
that moves around a
much larger object can
also be called a satellite.
For example, Earth can
be considered
a satellite of
the Sun.

The Moon
Earth's natural satellite, the Moon,
takes about 27 days to complete
one revolution around the Earth.
It is our nearest neighbour in the
space. Unlike on the Earth, there
is hardly any atmosphere on the
Moon. How big is the as
compared to the Earth? The Moon
is about a quarter the size of the
Earth in diameter. The Moon's
surface shows circular bowl-like
structures called craters (Fig.
12.9). Most of these craters have
been formed due to the impact of
asteroids or rocks from the space
hitting the Moon's surface. Since
there is no atmosphere, water or
life on the Moon, these features stay on the Moon's surface
for a very long time.
Although the Moon is very far, humans have sent
spacecrafts to explore and understand more about the
Moon. India has also launched three Chandrayaan missions
to study the Moon, and a further mission is being planned.Asteroids
The Sun and the planets are nearly spherical in shape. There
are many small objects in the Solar System which are rocky
and irregular in shape. These are called asteroids. Many of
these asteroids revolve around the Sun
in paths that lie between those of Mars
and Jupiter. This region is called the
asteroid belt (Fig. 12.7). Occasionally,
asteroids pass very close to the Earth.

tails are called comets (Fig. 12.10). They are made up of dust,
gases, rocks and ice. As a comet approaches close to the Sun,
the frozen material in it starts evaporating. This evaporating
material forms the tail of the comet. Comets appear dim as
they move away from the Sun and then, it is not possible to
see them with the naked eye.

"The First Printed Books
 The earliest kind of print technology was developed in China, Japan
 and Korea. This was a system of hand printing. From AD 594
 onwards, books in China were printed by rubbing paper – also
 invented there – against the inked surface of woodblocks. As both
 sides of the thin, porous sheet could not be printed, the traditional
 Chinese ‘accordion book’ was folded and stitched at the side.
 Superbly skilled craftsmen could duplicate, with remarkable accuracy,
 the beauty of calligraphy.
 The imperial state in China was, for a very long time, the major
 producer of printed material. China possessed a huge bureaucratic
 system which recruited its personnel through civil service
 examinations. Textbooks for this examination were printed in vast
 numbers under the sponsorship of the imperial state.  From the
 sixteenth century, the number of examination candidates went up
 and that increased the volume of print.
 By the seventeenth century, as urban culture bloomed in China, the
 uses of print diversified. Print was no longer used just by scholar
officials. Merchants used print in their everyday life, as they collected
 trade information. Reading increasingly became a leisure activity.
 The new readership preferred fictional narratives, poetry,
 autobiographies, anthologies of literary masterpieces, and romantic
 plays. Rich women began to read, and many women began
 publishing their poetry and plays. Wives of scholar-officials published
 their works and courtesans wrote about their lives.
 India and the Contemporary World
 This new reading culture was accompanied by a new technology.
 Western printing techniques and mechanical presses were imported
 in the late nineteenth century as Western powers established their
 outposts in China. Shanghai became the hub of the new print culture,
 catering to the Western-style schools. From hand printing there was
 now a gradual shift to mechanical printing",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Do not change the headings or sub headings if given. Also highlight important key words. ,"<h2>

" Print in Japan

 technology into Japan around AD 768-770. The oldest Japanese book,
 printed in AD 868, is the Buddhist Diamond Sutra, containing six sheets
 of text and woodcut illustrations. Pictures were printed on textiles,

playing cards and paper money. In medieval Japan, poets and
 prose writers were regularly published, and books were cheap
 and abundant.
 Printing of visual material led to interesting publishing practices. In
 the late eighteenth century, in the flourishing urban circles at Edo
 (later to be known as Tokyo), illustrated collections of paintings
 depicted an elegant urban culture, involving artists, courtesans, and
 teahouse gatherings. Libraries and bookstores were packed with
 hand-printed material of various types – books on women, musical
 instruments, calculations, tea ceremony, flower arrangements, proper
 etiquette, cooking and famous places

"Print Comes to Europe
 For centuries, silk and spices from China flowed into Europe through
 the silk route. In the eleventh century, Chinese paper reached Europe
 via the same route. Paper made possible the production of
 manuscripts, carefully written by scribes. Then, in 1295, Marco Polo,
 a great explorer, returned to Italy after many years of exploration in
 China. As you read above, China already had the technology of
 woodblock printing. Marco Polo brought this knowledge back with
 him. Now Italians began producing books with woodblocks, and
 soon the technology spread to other parts of Europe. Luxury
 editions were still handwritten on very expensive vellum, meant for
 aristocratic circles and rich monastic libraries which scoffed at printed
 books as cheap vulgarities. Merchants and students in the university
 towns bought the cheaper printed copies.
 As the demand for books increased, booksellers all over Europe
 began exporting books to many different countries. Book fairs were
 held at different places. Production of handwritten manuscripts was
 also organised in new ways to meet the expanded demand. Scribes
 or skilled handwriters were no longer solely employed by wealthy
 or influential patrons but increasingly by booksellers as well. More
 than 50 scribes often worked for one bookseller.
 India and the Contemporary World
 But the production of handwritten manuscripts could not satisfy
 the ever-increasing demand for books. Copying was an expensive,
 laborious and time-consuming business. Manuscripts were fragile,
 awkward to handle, and could not be carried around or read easily.
 Their circulation therefore remained limited.  With the growing
 demand for books, woodblock printing gradually became more
 and more popular. By the early fifteenth century, woodblocks were
 being widely used in Europe to print textiles, playing cards, and
 religious pictures with simple, brief texts.
 There was clearly a great need for even quicker and cheaper
 reproduction of texts. This could only be with the invention of a
 new print technology. The breakthrough occurred at Strasbourg,
 Germany, where Johann Gutenberg developed the first-known
 printing press in the 1430s",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Do not change the headings or sub headings if given. Also highlight important key words. ,"<h2>

"Gutenberg and the Printing Press
 Gutenberg was the son of a merchant and grew up on a large
 agricultural estate. From his childhood he had seen wine and olive
 presses. Subsequently, he learnt the art of polishing stones, became a
 master goldsmith, and also acquired the expertise to create lead
 moulds used for making trinkets. Drawing on this knowledge,
 Gutenberg adapted existing technology to design his innovation.
 The olive press provided the model for the printing press, and moulds
 were used for casting the metal types for the letters of the alphabet.
 By 1448, Gutenberg perfected the system. The first book he printed
 was the Bible. About 180 copies were printed and it took three
 years to produce them. By the standards of the time this was fast
 production.
 The new technology did not entirely displace the existing art of
 producing books by hand.
 In fact, printed books at first closely resembled the written
 manuscripts in appearance and layout. The metal letters imitated the
 ornamental handwritten styles. Borders were illuminated by hand
 with foliage and other patterns, and illustrations were painted. In the
 books printed for the rich, space for decoration was kept blank on
 the printed page. Each purchaser could choose the design and decide
 on the painting school that would do the illustrations.
 In the hundred years between 1450 and 1550, printing presses were
 set up in most countries of Europe.  Printers from Germany travelled
 to other countries, seeking work and helping start new presses. As
 the number of printing presses grew, book production boomed.
 The second half of the fifteenth century saw 20 million copies of
 printed books flooding the markets in Europe. The number went
 up in the sixteenth century to about 200 million copies.
 This shift from hand printing to mechanical printing led to the
 print revolution",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Do not change the headings or sub headings if given. Also highlight important key words. ," <h3>

"The Print Revolution and Its Impact
 What was the print revolution? It was not just a development, a new
 way of producing books; it  transformed the lives of people,
 changing their relationship to information and knowledge, and with
 institutions and authorities. It influenced popular perceptions and
 opened up new ways of looking at things.
 Let us explore some of these changes.
 3.1 A New Reading Public
 With the printing press, a new reading public emerged. Printing
 reduced the cost of books. The time and labour required to produce
 each book came down, and multiple copies could be produced
 with greater ease. Books flooded the market, reaching out to an
 ever-growing readership.
 Access to books created a new culture of reading. Earlier, reading
 was restricted to the elites. Common people lived in a world of oral
 culture. They heard sacred texts read out, ballads recited, and folk
 tales narrated. Knowledge was transferred orally. People collectively
 heard a story, or saw a performance. As you will see in Chapter 8,
 they did not read a book individually and silently. Before the age of
 print, books were not only expensive but they could not be produced
 in sufficient numbers. Now books could reach out to wider sections
 of people. If earlier there was a hearing public, now a reading public
 came into being.
 But the transition was not so simple. Books could be read only by
 the literate, and the rates of literacy in most European countries
 were very low till the twentieth century. How, then, could publishers
 persuade the common people to welcome the printed book? To do
 this, they had to keep in mind the wider reach of the printed work:
 even those who did not read could certainly enjoy listening to books
 being read out. So printers began publishing popular ballads and
 folk tales, and such books would be profusely illustrated with pictures.
 These were then sung and recited at gatherings in villages and in
 taverns in towns.
 Oral culture thus entered print and printed material was orally
 transmitted. The line that separated the oral and reading cultures
 became blurred. And the hearing public and reading public became
 intermingled",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Do not change the headings or sub headings if given. Also highlight important key words. ,"<h3>

" Religious Debates and the Fear of Print
 Print created the possibility of wide circulation of
 ideas, and introduced a new world of debate and
 discussion. Even those who disagreed with
 established authorities could now print and circulate
 their ideas. Through the printed message, they could
 persuade people to think differently, and move them
 to action. This had significance in different spheres
 of life.
 Not everyone welcomed the printed book, and those
 who did also had fears about it. Many were
 apprehensive of the effects that the easier access to
 the printed word and the wider circulation of books,
 could have on people’s minds. It was feared that if
 there was no control over what was printed and
 read then rebellious and irreligious thoughts might
 spread. If that happened the authority of ‘valuable’
 literature would be destroyed. Expressed by religious
 authorities and monarchs, as well as many writers
 and artists, this anxiety was the basis of widespread
 criticism of the new printed literature that had began
 to circulate.
 India and the Contemporary World
 Let us consider the implication of this in one sphere
 of life in early modern Europe – namely,  religion.
 In 1517, the religious reformer Martin Luther wrote
 Ninety Five Theses criticising many of the practices
 and rituals of the Roman Catholic Church.  A printed
 Fig. 9 – J.V. Schley, L’Imprimerie, 1739.
 This is one of the many images produced in early modern
 Europe, celebrating the coming of print. You can see the
 printing press descending from heaven, carried by a goddess.
 On two sides of the goddess, blessing the machine, are
 Minerva (the goddess of wisdom) and Mercury (the messenger
 god, also symbolising reason). The women in the foreground
 are holding plaques with the portraits of six pioneer printers of
 different countries. In the middle ground on the left (figure
 encircled) is the portrait of Gutenberg.
 copy of this was posted on a church door in Wittenberg. It challenged
 the Church to debate his ideas.  Luther’s writings were immediately
 reproduced in vast numbers and read widely. This lead to a division
 within the Church and to the beginning of the Protestant
 Reformation. Luther’s translation of the New Testament sold 5,000
 copies within a few weeks and a second edition appeared within
 three months. Deeply grateful to print, Luther said, ‘Printing is the
 ultimate gift of God and the greatest one.’ Several scholars, in fact,
 think that print brought about a new intellectual atmosphere and
 helped spread the new ideas that led to the Reformation.",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Also highlight important key words. ,"<h3>

"Print and Dissent
 Print and popular religious literature stimulated many distinctive
 individual interpretations of faith even among little-educated working
 people. In the sixteenth century, Menocchio, a miller in Italy, began
 to read books that were available in his locality. He reinterpreted the
 message of the Bible and formulated a view of God and Creation
 that enraged the Roman Catholic Church. When the Roman Church
 began its inquisition to repress heretical ideas, Menocchio was hauled
 up twice and ultimately executed. The Roman Church, troubled by
 such effects of popular readings and questionings of faith, imposed
 severe controls over publishers and booksellers and began to maintain
 an Index of Prohibited Books from 1558",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Also highlight important key words. ,"<h3>

" The Reading Mania
 Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries literacy rates went
 up in most parts of Europe. Churches of different denominations
 set up schools in villages, carrying literacy to peasants and artisans.
 By the end of the eighteenth century, in some parts of Europe
 literacy rates were as high as 60 to 80 per cent. As literacy and schools
 spread in European countries, there was a virtual reading mania.
 People wanted books to read and printers produced books in ever
increasing numbers.
 New forms of popular literature appeared in print, targeting new
 audiences. Booksellers employed pedlars who roamed around
 villages, carrying little books for sale. There were almanacs or ritual
 calendars, along with ballads and folktales. But other forms of reading
 matter, largely for entertainment, began to reach ordinary readers as
 well. In England, penny chapbooks were carried by petty pedlars
 known as chapmen, and sold for a penny, so that even the poor
 could buy them. In France, were the ‘Biliotheque Bleue’, which were
 low-priced small books printed on poor quality paper, and bound
 in cheap blue covers. Then there were the romances, printed on
 four to six pages, and the more substantial ‘histories’ which were
 stories about the past. Books were of various sizes, serving many
 different purposes and interests.
 India and the Contemporary World
 The periodical press developed from the early eighteenth century,
 combining information about current affairs with entertainment.
 Newspapers and journals carried information about wars and trade,
 as well as news of developments in other places.
 Similarly, the ideas of scientists and philosophers now became more
 accessible to the common people. Ancient and medieval scientific
 texts were compiled and published, and maps and scientific diagrams
 were widely printed. When scientists like Isaac Newton began to
 publish their discoveries, they could influence a much wider circle
 of scientifically minded readers. The writings of thinkers such as
 Thomas Paine, Voltaire and Jean Jacques Rousseau were also widely
 printed and read. Thus their ideas about science, reason and rationality
 found their way into popular literature

"‘Tremble, therefore, tyrants of the world!’
 By the mid-eighteenth century, there was a common conviction that
 books were a means of spreading progress and enlightenment. Many
 believed that books could change the world,  liberate society from
 despotism and tyranny, and herald a time when reason and intellect
 would rule. Louise-Sebastien Mercier, a novelist in eighteenth-century
 France, declared: ‘The printing press is the most powerful engine of
 progress and public opinion is the force that will sweep despotism
 away.’ In many of Mercier’s novels, the heroes are transformed by
 acts of reading. They devour books, are lost in the world books
 create, and become enlightened in the process.  Convinced of the
 power of print in bringing enlightenment and destroying the basis
 of despotism, Mercier proclaimed: ‘Tremble, therefore, tyrants of
 the world! Tremble before the virtual writer!’
 4.2 Print Culture and the French Revolution
 Many historians have argued that print culture created the conditions
 within which French Revolution occurred. Can we make such
 a connection?
 Three types of arguments have been usually put forward.
 First: print popularised the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers.
 Collectively, their writings provided a critical commentary on tradition,
 superstition and despotism. They argued for the rule of reason rather
 than custom, and demanded that everything be judged through the
 application of reason and rationality. They attacked the sacred
 authority of the Church and the despotic power of the state, thus
 eroding the legitimacy of a social order based on tradition. The
 writings of Voltaire and Rousseau were read widely; and those who
 read these books saw the world through new eyes, eyes that were
 questioning, critical and rational.
 Second: print created a new culture of dialogue and debate. All
 values, norms and institutions were re-evaluated and discussed by a
 public that had become aware of the power of reason, and
 recognised the need to question existing ideas and beliefs. Within
 this public culture, new ideas of social revolution came into being.
 Third: by the 1780s there was an outpouring of literature that mocked
 the royalty and criticised their morality. In the process, it raised
questions about the existing social order. Cartoons and caricatures
 typically suggested that the monarchy remained absorbed only in
 sensual pleasures while the common people suffered  immense
 hardships. This literature circulated underground and led to the
 growth of hostile sentiments against the monarchy.
 How do we look at these arguments?  There can be no doubt that
 print helps the spread of ideas. But we must remember that people
 did not read just one kind of literature. If they read the ideas of
 Voltaire and Rousseau, they were also exposed to monarchical and
 Church propaganda. They were not influenced directly by everything
 they read or saw. They accepted some ideas and rejected others.
 They interpreted things their own way. Print did not directly shape
 their minds, but it did open up the possibility of thinking differently.",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Also highlight important key words. ,"<h3>

" The Nineteenth Century
 The nineteenth century saw vast leaps in mass literacy in Europe,
 bringing in large numbers of new readers among children,
 women and workers.
 5.1 Children, Women and Workers
 As primary education became compulsory from the late
 nineteenth century, children became an important category
 of readers. Production of school textbooks became critical
 for the publishing industry. A children’s press, devoted to
 literature for children alone, was set up in France in 1857.
 This press published new works as well as old fairy tales
 and folk tales. The Grimm Brothers in Germany spent years
 compiling traditional folk tales gathered from peasants. What
 they collected was edited before the stories were published
 in a collection in 1812.  Anything  that was considered
 unsuitable for children or would appear vulgar to the elites,
 was not included in the  published version.  Rural folk tales
 thus acquired a new form. In this way, print recorded old
 tales but also changed them.
 Women became important as readers as well as writers. Penny
 magazines (see Fig. 12) were especially meant for women, as
 were manuals teaching proper behaviour and housekeeping.
 When novels began to be written in the nineteenth century,
 women were seen as important readers. Some of the best
known novelists were women: Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters,
 George Eliot. Their writings became important in defining a new
 type of woman:  a person with will, strength of personality,
 determination and the power to think.

 Penny Magazine was published between 1832 and 1835
 in England by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
 Knowledge. It was aimed primarily at the working class.

 Lending libraries had been in existence from the seventeenth century
 onwards. In the nineteenth century, lending libraries in England
 became instruments for educating white-collar workers, artisans
 and lower-middle-class people. Sometimes, self-educated working
 class people wrote for themselves. After the working day was
 gradually shortened from the mid-nineteenth century, workers had
 some time for self-improvement and self-expression. They wrote
 political tracts and autobiographies in large numbersFurther Innovations
 By the late eighteenth century, the press came to be made out of
 metal. Through the nineteenth century, there were a series of further
 innovations in printing technology. By the mid-nineteenth century,
 Richard M. Hoe of New York had perfected the power-driven
 cylindrical press. This was capable of printing 8,000 sheets per hour.
 This press was particularly useful for printing newspapers.  In the
 late nineteenth century, the offset press was developed which could
 print up to six colours at a time. From the turn of the twentieth
 century, electrically operated presses accelerated printing operations.
 A series of other developments followed. Methods of feeding paper
 improved, the quality of plates became better, automatic paper reels
 and photoelectric controls of the colour register were introduced.
 The accumulation of several individual mechanical improvements
 transformed the appearance of printed texts.
 Printers and publishers continuously developed new strategies
 to sell their product. Nineteenth-century periodicals serialised
 important novels, which gave birth to a particular way of writing
 novels.  In the 1920s in England, popular works were sold in
 cheap series, called the Shilling Series. The dust cover or the
 book jacket is also a twentieth-century innovation. With the
 onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, publishers feared a
 decline in book purchases. To sustain buying, they brought
 out cheap paperback editions",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Also highlight important key words. Do not change the headings or sub headings if given. ," <h2>

" India and the World of Print
 Let us see when printing began in India and how ideas and information
 were written before the age of print.
 6.1 Manuscripts Before the Age of Print
 India had a very rich and old tradition of handwritten manuscripts 
in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, as well as in various vernacular languages.
 Manuscripts were copied on palm leaves or on handmade paper.
 Pages were sometimes beautifully illustrated. They would be either
 pressed between wooden covers or sewn together to ensure
 preservation. Manuscripts continued to be produced till well after
 the introduction of print, down to the late nineteenth century.
 Manuscripts, however, were highly expensive and fragile. They had
 to be handled carefully, and they  could not be read easily as thescript was written in different styles. So
 manuscripts were not widely used in
 everyday life. Even though pre-colonial
 Bengal had developed an extensive network
 of village primary schools, students very
 often did not read texts. They only learnt
 to write. Teachers dictated portions of
 texts from memory and students wrote
 them down. Many thus became literate
 without ever actually reading any kinds
 of texts.
 6.2 Print Comes to India
 Fig. 16 – Pages from the Rigveda.
 Handwritten manuscripts continued to be produced in India till much after
 the coming of print. This manuscript was produced in the eighteenth
 century in the Malayalam script.
 The printing press first came to Goa with Portuguese missionaries
 in the mid-sixteenth century. Jesuit priests learnt Konkani and
 printed several tracts. By 1674, about 50 books had been printed
 in the Konkani and in Kanara languages. Catholic priests printed
 the first Tamil book in 1579 at Cochin, and in 1713 the first
 Malayalam book was printed by them. By 1710, Dutch Protestant
 missionaries had printed 32 Tamil texts, many of them translations
 of older works.
 The English language press did not grow in India till quite late even
 though the English East India Company began to import presses
 from the late seventeenth century.
 India and the Contemporary World
 From 1780, James Augustus Hickey began to edit the Bengal Gazette,
 a weekly magazine that described itself as ‘a commercial paper open
 to all, but influenced by none’. So it was private English enterprise,
 proud of its independence from colonial influence, that began English
 printing in India. Hickey published a lot of advertisements, including
 those that related to the import and sale of slaves. But he also
 published a lot of gossip about the Company’s senior officials in
 India. Enraged by this, Governor-General Warren Hastings
 persecuted Hickey, and encouraged the publication of officially
 sanctioned newspapers that could counter the flow of information
 that damaged the image of the colonial government. By the
 close of the eighteenth century, a number of newspapers and
 journals appeared in print. There were Indians, too, who began
 to publish Indian newspapers. The first to appear was the weekly
 Bengal Gazette, brought out by Gangadhar Bhattacharya, who
 was close to Rammohun Roy",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Also highlight important key words. Do not change the headings or sub headings if given. ,"<h2>

"Religious Reform and Public Debates
 From the early nineteenth century, as you know, there were intense
 debates around religious issues. Different groups confronted the
 changes happening within colonial society in different ways, and
 offered a variety of new interpretations of the beliefs of different
 religions. Some criticised existing practices and campaigned for
 reform, while others countered the arguments of reformers. These
 debates were carried out in public and in print. Printed tracts and
 newspapers not only spread the new ideas, but they shaped the
 nature of the debate. A wider public could now participate in these
 public discussions and express their views. New ideas emerged
 through these clashes of opinions.
 This was a time of intense controversies between social and religious
 reformers and the Hindu orthodoxy over matters like widow
 immolation, monotheism, Brahmanical priesthood and idolatry. In
 Bengal, as the debate developed, tracts and newspapers proliferated,
 circulating a variety of arguments. To reach a wider audience, the
 ideas were printed in the everyday, spoken language of ordinary
 people. Rammohun Roy published the Sambad Kaumudi from 1821
 and the Hindu orthodoxy commissioned the Samachar Chandrika
 to oppose his opinions. From 1822, two Persian newspapers were
 published, Jam-i-Jahan Nama and Shamsul Akhbar. In the same year,
 a Gujarati newspaper, the Bombay Samachar, made its appearance.
 In north India, the ulama were deeply anxious about the collapse
 of Muslim dynasties. They feared that colonial rulers would
 encourage conversion, change the Muslim personal laws. To counter
 this, they used cheap lithographic presses, published Persian and
 Urdu translations of holy scriptures, and printed religious
 newspapers and tracts. The Deoband Seminary, founded in 1867,
 published thousands upon thousands of fatwas telling Muslim
 readers how to conduct themselves in their everyday lives, and
 explaining the meanings of Islamic doctrines. All through the
 nineteenth century, a number of Muslim sects and seminaries
 appeared, each with a different interpretation of faith, each keen
 on enlarging its following and countering the influence of its
 opponents. Urdu print helped them conduct these battles in public.
 Among Hindus, too, print encouraged the reading of religious texts,
 especially in the vernacular languages. The first printed edition of  the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas, a sixteenth-century text, came out
 from Calcutta in 1810. By the mid-nineteenth century, cheap
 lithographic editions flooded north Indian markets. From the 1880s,
 the Naval Kishore Press at Lucknow and the Shri Venkateshwar
 Press in Bombay published numerous religious texts in vernaculars.
 In their printed and portable form, these could be read easily by the
 faithful at any place and time. They could also be read out to large
 groups of illiterate men and women.
 Religious texts, therefore, reached a very wide circle of people,
 encouraging discussions, debates and controversies within and
 among different religions.       
Print did not only stimulate the publication of conflicting opinions
 amongst communities, but it also connected communities and people
 in different parts of India. Newspapers conveyed news from one
 place to another, creating pan-Indian identities",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Also highlight important key words. Do not change the headings or sub headings if given. ,"<h2>

"New Forms of Publication
 Printing created an appetite for new kinds of writing. As more and
 more people could now read, they wanted to see their own lives,
 experiences, emotions and relationships reflected in what they read.
 The novel, a literary firm which had developed in Europe, ideally
 catered to this need. It soon acquired distinctively Indian forms and
 styles. For readers, it opened up new worlds of experience, and
 gave a vivid sense of the diversity of human lives.
 Other new literary forms also entered the world of reading 
lyrics, short stories, essays about social and political matters. In
 different ways, they reinforced the new emphasis on human lives
 and intimate feelings, about the political and social rules that shaped
 such things.
 By the end of the nineteenth century, a new visual
 culture was taking shape. With the setting up of an
 increasing number of printing presses, visual images
 could be easily reproduced in multiple copies. Painters
 like Raja Ravi Varma produced images for mass
 circulation. Poor wood engravers who made
 woodblocks set up shop near the letterpresses, and
 were employed by print shops. Cheap prints and
 calendars, easily available in the bazaar, could be
 bought even by the poor to decorate the walls of
 their homes or places of work. These prints began
 shaping popular ideas about modernity and tradition,
 religion and politics, and society and culture.
 By the 1870s, caricatures and cartoons were being
 published in journals and newspapers, commenting
 on social and political issues. Some caricatures
 ridiculed the educated Indians’ fascination with
 Western tastes and clothes, while others expressed
 the fear of social change. There were imperial
 caricatures lampooning nationalists, as well as
 nationalist cartoons criticising imperial rule.",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Also highlight important key words. ,"<h2>

'that such assenting panies shall be competent to contract; and accordingly, in order to there
being a valid contract, a capacity to contract is absolutely necessary"". In India, the law regarding
contracts is majorly the Indian Contract Act Of 1872. Therein, capacity is dealt With in Section I I
of the Act. Section 11 says:
Who are competent to contract?

"2. MINOR'S AGREEMENT
Who is a minor?
A person who has not attained the age of majority is a minor. S.3 of the Indian Majority Act,
1875 provides about the age of majority. It states that a person is deemed to have attained the age
of majority when he completes that age of 18 years, except in case of a person of whose person
or property a guardian has been appointed by the court, in which case the age of majority is 21
years.
Nature Of a minor's agreement
As stated above a minor is not competent to contract. The question that arises in case of an
agreement by a minor is, whether the agreement is void or voidable? S. 10 mandate that the
agreement shall be between parties competent to contract. Section I I indicates that the minor is
incapable of entering into contract. But neither section provides as to the effect of agreement
entered into by a minor. This led to a controversy
I.

loan of Rs. 20,000/-, after some money was advanced plaintiff. came to know about infancy

"Effects of Minor's Agreement
No estoppel against minor
When a minor by misrepresenting his age induces another to contract with him no estoppel is
available against him — there cannot be estoppel against statute — policy of law is to protect
minor from contractual liability — doctrine of estoppel cannot be applied to defeat the policy - An
infant is not estopped from setting up the defense of minority. Estoppel means when person
makes statement and any other person acted on such statement. Then such statement can not be
denied or contradicted. In case of Mohiri Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose when a minor
misrepresented his age while taking loan, but the fact that the person taking the loan is a minor
was known to the money lender. The Privy Council did not consider it necessary to decide
whether law of estoppels was applicable to the case, because the money lender was not misled by
the false statement by the minor and he was aware of the age of the borrower and that the law of
estoppel does not apply against a minor.
No liability for tort based in contract
An agreement by the minor is void and, therefore, if a minor makes a breach of an
agreement, he cannot be made liable for the same. On the other hand, when a minor commits a
tort, he is liable for that in the same way and to the same extent as an adult person. Sometimes an
act done by minor may be both a breach of contract as well as the commission of a tort. In the
case of Johnson v. Pye, a minor falsely stated that he was of the age of majority and obtained a
loan of S3(K). It was held that the minor cannot be asked to repay the loan by bringing an action
for deceit against him. Minor's agreement is devoid of all consequences in law. A contract
cannot be converted into a tort to sue an infant .Minor is not liable for tort connected with
contract, but he is not absolved from liability for independent tort.

        </li>
        <li>

            There are instances where an action by a minor may constitute both a

            case of
            <strong>
                Johnson v. Pye
            </strong>
            , a minor falsely claimed to be of legal age and obtained a loan of
            $300. The court ruled that the minor could not be compelled to repay

"• Indian Law: Compensation by a minor
The question which has arisen in India is how far a minor can be asked to restore back the
benefit wlongly obtained by him under a void agreement? Can a minor be asked to pay
compensation to the other pany?
The following two kinds of provisions have arisen before the courts:
l. Whether a minor can be asked to pay compensation under S.64 and 65, Indian contract act
for the benefit obtained by him under a void agreement?
2. Whether a minor can be asked to pay compensation in view of the provisions contained in
S.39 and 41, Specific Relief Act?
In Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose, the question whether a minor can be asked to pay
compensation to the other party, under S.64 and 65 had arisen in this case. The privy council
held that the question of compensation under S.64 and 65, Indian Contract Act, arises where the
parties are competent to contract, and these provisions does not apply to the case of a minor's
agreement. In this case the minor had applied for the cancellation of the mortgage deed,
executed by him, under S.39, Specific Relief Act and the Privy Council consideted the question
of compensation to be paid by him under SAI of that act. It wms held that since in this case the
loan had been advanced to the minor with the full knowledge of his minority, the question of
payment of compensation to such a money lender did not arise.
Liability to restore benefitsWhere a minor seeks the help of court for the cancellation of his contract, the court may grant
the relief subject to the condition that he shall restore all benefits obtained by him under the
contract, the court may grant relief subject to the condition that he shall restore all benefits
obtained by him under the contract or make suitable compensation to the other party. In the case
of Khangul v. Lakhasingh, the defendant fraudulently concealing his age agreed to sell a plot of
land, received Rs.17,500/-, refused to perform his promise and hence the plaintiff sued for
possession or refund of consideration. The court held that the agreement was void and hence
denied possession of the land but ordered payment of consideration back to the plaintiff. The
reasons for the judgment were given by Shadilal CJ as follows: ""There is no real difference
between restoring the property and refunding money except that property can be identified but
cash cannot be traced. It must be remembered that while in India all contracts made by infants
are void, there is no such general rule in England. Therefore, there should be a greater scope in
India than in England for the application of the doctrine of equitable restitution.""",paraphrase the information and give in points. make language which is easy for layman to understand. Also highlight important key words. Do not change the headings or subheadings if given.,"<h3>

        compensation to the other party.

            In this case, the issue of whether a minor could be asked to pay

            arose.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Privy Council ruled that compensation under these sections is
            applicable only when the parties are competent to contract and does
            not apply to a minor's agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
            The minor in this case sought to cancel a mortgage deed he had

            under Section 41 of the Specific Relief Act.
        </li>
        <li>
            It was determined that since the loan was given to the minor with
            full knowledge of his minority, the question of compensation to the
            money lender did not arise.

        When a minor seeks the court's assistance to cancel a contract, the
        court may grant relief with the condition that the minor restores all
        benefits received under the contract. Alternatively, the minor may be
