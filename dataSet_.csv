"Methods of Sampling Sampling is a technique used in research where a subset of individuals is selected from a larger population to represent the entire population. This section discusses various methods of sampling. Random Sampling Random sampling is a method where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This can be done in several ways: Lottery Method Each member of the population is assigned a number, and numbers are randomly drawn to select the sample. Tables of Random Numbers A table of random numbers is used to randomly select members from the population. Purposeful or Deliberate Sampling This method involves the researcher making deliberate choices about which members of the population to include based on who they believe will provide the best information. Stratified or Mixed Sampling This method involves dividing the population into distinct strata or groups based on certain characteristics. A random sample is then taken from each group. This ensures that different segments of the population are adequately represented. Example: If studying a population with different age groups, the population is divided into age categories, and samples are taken from each category. Systematic Sampling In systematic sampling, items are selected from an ordered list at regular intervals. Example: Every 10th item on a list is selected. Cluster Sampling In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters (groups), and a random sample of clusters is selected. All members of the chosen clusters are then included in the sample. Example: Dividing a city into districts and randomly selecting districts, then surveying all individuals in those districts. Quota Sampling Quota sampling involves dividing the population into groups and then sampling a specific quota from each group, similar to stratified sampling, but without random selection within groups. Convenience Sampling In convenience sampling, the sample is chosen based on ease of access and convenience to the researcher. Example: Surveying individuals who are easily accessible, such as people in a shopping mall. Reliability of Sampling Data The reliability of sampling data depends on several factors: Size of the Sample Larger samples tend to be more representative of the population. Method of Sampling The chosen sampling method impacts the reliability and accuracy of the data. Skills of Correspondents and Enumerators The effectiveness of those collecting the data affects its reliability. Training of Enumerators Proper training ensures that data collection is consistent and accurate. Important Organizations for Data Collection Several national and international organizations collect, process, and publish statistical data. Key organizations include: NSSO (National Sample Survey Organization) Conducts large-scale surveys on socio-economic issues. RBI (Reserve Bank of India) Collects and publishes financial and economic data. Registrar General of India Conducts the Census and collects vital statistics. DGCIS (Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics) Collects trade statistics. Labour Bureau Collects data on labor and employment.",Paraphrase above information in points .

    Sampling</strong>
<p>Random sampling ensures that every member of a population has an equal chance
    of being selected. This method minimizes selection bias and ensures
    representativeness.</p>
<p>(a)Lottery Method:</p><strong>(a)Lottery Method</strong>
<p>Each member of the population is assigned a unique number. Numbers are then
    randomly drawn to select the sample.</p>
<p>Example: In a class of 30 students, each student is assigned a number from 1
    to 30. Numbers are drawn randomly to select 5 students for a survey.</p>
<strong>Example</strong>
<p>Tables of Random Numbers:</p><strong>Tables of Random Numbers</strong>
<ul>Description: A pre-generated table of random numbers is used to select
    members from the population.Example: Using a table, a researcher might
    randomly select students from a list of 100 based on random numbers that
    fall within the list.</ul><strong>Description</strong><strong>Purposeful or
    Deliberate Sampling</strong>
<p>Purposeful sampling involves selecting specific individuals based on certain
    criteria deemed important for the study. This is often used when specific
    insights are required. The researcher identifies individuals who are thought
    to have particular knowledge or experience relevant to the study.</p>
<p>Example: In a study about expert opinions on climate change, researchers
    might only select environmental scientists and policy makers.</p>
<strong>Stratified or Mixed Sampling</strong>
<p>Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into distinct sub-groups
    (strata) and then randomly sampling from each stratum. This ensures that all
    sub-groups are represented.The population is divided based on
    characteristics like age, gender, income, etc. A random sample is drawn from
    each stratum.</p>
<ul>Example: In a survey of a city's population, the city might be divided into
    age groups (e.g., 18-30, 31-50, 51+) and a random sample taken from each
    group to ensure representation across all ages. </ul><strong>Systematic
    Sampling</strong>
<p>Systematic sampling involves selecting every nth item from a list of the
    population. A starting point is selected at random, and then every nth item
    in the list is chosen.</p>
<ul>Example: In a list of 1000 names, every 10th person might be selected for a
    survey, starting from a random point in the list.</ul><strong>Cluster
    Sampling</strong>
<p>Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and then
    randomly selecting some clusters to include all members from those clusters.
    The population is divided into clusters, which could be geographic or
    organizational units. Clusters are randomly chosen, and all members of these
    clusters are included in the sample.</p>
<ul>Example: In a national survey, cities (clusters) are randomly selected, and
    all residents within those cities are surveyed.</ul><strong>Quota
    Sampling</strong>
<p>Quota sampling involves dividing the population into groups and then
    selecting samples from each group to meet a specific quota. This method is
    similar to stratified sampling but does not involve random selection within
    groups. The population is segmented into groups, and samples are taken until
    a pre-set number of individuals from each group are included.</p>
<ul>Example: A survey requires 100 respondents with specific quotas for gender,
    age, and occupation. Once quotas are met, sampling stops.</ul>
<strong>Convenience Sampling</strong>
<p>Convenience sampling involves selecting individuals who are easiest to reach
    or most convenient for the researcher. The sample is chosen based on ease of
    access rather than randomness.</p>
<ul>Example: Surveying people at a local grocery store because it is easily
    accessible, rather than attempting to reach a broader population. </ul>
<h3>Reliability of Sampling Data</h3>
<p>The reliability of sampling data can be influenced by several factors:</p>
<ul>Size of the Sample: Larger samples generally provide more reliable estimates
    of the population and reduce sampling error.Method of Sampling: The choice
    of sampling method impacts how representative and unbiased the sample is.
    Random methods tend to be more reliable compared to non-random
    methods.Skills of Correspondents and Enumerators: The effectiveness and
    competence of those collecting the data play a crucial role in data
    reliability. Skilled individuals are more likely to gather accurate and
    consistent information.Training of Enumerators: Proper training ensures that
    data collection is done uniformly and correctly, minimizing errors and
    biases.</ul>

"What are Common Challenges in Data Collection?
Data Quality Issues: The main problem affecting the extensive use of machine learning is poor data quality. To make technologies like machine learning work well, you need to focus on ensuring data quality. Inconsistent Data: When dealing with various data sources, there can be differences in the same information, like formats, units, or even spellings. These differences can arise during company mergers or relocations. Inconsistent data, if not dealt with consistently, can lessen the value of the data over time. Organizations that stress data consistency aim to have reliable data to support their analyses. Data Downtime: Data is crucial for the decisions and operations of data-focused businesses. However, there can be short periods when data is not reliable or unavailable. This data unavailability can lead to customer complaints and below-par analytical outcomes. Data engineers spend a lot of time ensuring data pipelines are current and dependable. From data collection to insights, the time taken to process data can be long, incurring high costs. Ambiguous Data: Even with careful oversight, mistakes can still happen in large databases or data lakes, especially with rapidly streaming data. These mistakes can involve unnoticed spelling errors, formatting problems, or misleading column headings. Unclear data can result in various reporting and analytics challenges. Duplicate Data: Streaming data, local databases, and cloud data lakes are some of the data sources that modern businesses have to deal with. They may also have application and system silos. These sources are likely to duplicate and overlap quite a bit. Duplicate contact information, for example, significantly impacts the customer experience. When certain prospects are overlooked while others are contacted repeatedly, marketing campaigns suffer. The chances of biased analytical outcomes rise when there is duplicate data. It can also lead to machine learning models with biased training data. Too Much Data: While we emphasize data-driven analytics and its benefits, there is a data quality issue with too much data. There is a risk of getting lost in a large amount of data when looking for information relevant to your analytical efforts. Data scientists, data analysts, and business users spend 80% of their time searching for and organizing the right data. With an increase in data volume, other data quality problems become more serious, especially when dealing with streaming data and large files or databases. Inaccurate Data: For heavily regulated industries like healthcare, data accuracy is vital. Given the current situation, increasing data quality for situations like COVID-19 and future pandemics is crucial. Inaccurate information doesn't give you an accurate picture of the situation and can't be used to plan the best course of action. Personalized customer experiences and marketing strategies underperform if your customer data is inaccurate. Hidden Data: Most businesses only use a portion of their data, with the rest sometimes lost in data silos or discarded in data graveyards. For example, the customer service team might not receive customer data from sales, missing a chance to build more precise and comprehensive customer profiles. Missing opportunities to develop new products, improve services, and streamline processes are caused by hidden data. Finding Relevant Data: Finding relevant data is not straightforward. There are many factors to consider when trying to find relevant data, such as the relevant domain, demographics, time period, and more. Data that isn't relevant to our study in any of these factors becomes obsolete and we can't effectively proceed with its analysis. This could lead to incomplete research or analysis, repetitive data collection, or the termination of the study. Deciding the Data to Collect: Determining what data to collect is one of the most crucial factors when collecting data and should be among the first considerations. We need to choose the subjects the data will cover, the sources we will use to gather it, and the amount of information we will need. Our answers to these questions will depend on our goals or what we aim to achieve using the data. For example, we may choose to gather information on the types of articles that website visitors between the ages of 20 and 50 access most frequently. We could also opt to gather data on the average age of all customers who made a purchase from your business in the last month. Dealing With Big Data: Big data refers to extremely large data sets with complex and diverse structures. These characteristics often result in increased challenges when storing, analyzing, and utilizing different methods to extract results. Big data particularly refers to data sets that are very large or complex, making traditional data processing tools insufficient. The massive amount of data, both unstructured and structured, that a business encounters on a daily basis. Low Response and Other Research Issues: Poor design and low response rates have been identified as two issues with data collection, especially in health surveys that used questionnaires. This can lead to an inadequate or insufficient supply of data for the study. Establishing an incentivized data collection program could be helpful in increasing responses.",Paraphrase above information in points . Make sure language you use should be in layman .

"Q3: Examine the linkages between the nineteenth century’s Indian Renaissance and the emergence of national identity. 
Ans: Nineteenth century witnessed significant changes in Indian polity and society consequent to the expansion and consolidation of British imperialism in India which made Indians realise that their interests were sacrificed in order to promote the interests of the British authority. The impact of modern western culture and consciousness of defeat by a foreign power gave birth to a new awakening. The modern educational systems familiarised the educated classes with the ideas of equality, liberty and nationalism. They were impressed by modern science and the doctrines of reason and humanism. Thoughtful Indians who were product of modern education began to look for the strengths and weaknesses of their society aimed at giving back to the nation its lost identity. This new cultural project, which partly manifested itself through the social and religious reforms was encoded in the phrase ‘Indian Renaissance’. It marked a period of transition in values, transformation in social sensibilities and rebirth in cultural creativity. A defining feature of the movement was an inquiry into the past and an assessment of the traditions to overcome contemporary problems. Ram Mohan Roy’s use of Hindu scriptures in his debate with his opponents on Sati, or Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar’s widow remarriage campaign, or Narayana Guru’s advocacy of universalism sought to eliminate social obscurantism, religious superstition and irrational rituals. The common feature that they all shared was the urge to transform the existing social and cultural conditions, ranging from irrational religious practices and rituals to the oppressive state of women’s lives. Renaissance ‘purified’ and ‘rediscovered’ an Indian civilisation that was conformant with the European ideals of rationalism, empiricism, monotheism and individualism. It was meant to show that Indian civilisation was by no means inferior to that of the West, rather in one sense, in its spiritual accomplishments it was even superior to it. Evidence of this search for a superior national culture could be found in the development of patriotic regional literature, in the evolution of new art forms, in the search for purer forms of classical music and in the construction of new ideals of womanhood. The literary movement led by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Tagore, Iqbal and Subramaniya Bharati provided leadership with imagination and fervor. The movement, thus, not only talked of beauty and nationalism but also revealed to its followers India in terms of its spirit, its philosophy, its arts, its poetry, its music and its myriad ways of life. The sense of pride in the spiritual essence of Indian civilisation, as opposed to the material culture of the West, motivated Indians to confront the colonial state in a newly emerging public space. This, in other words, provided the ideological foundation of modern Indian nationalism that developed in the late nineteenth century.",Paraphrase the above text but don't change the basic sense of the passage and don't make the language complicated.

    century’s Indian Renaissance and the emergence of national identity.
    (Ancient History and Art & Culture)</strong>
<p>Nineteenth-century Transformations in India: The 19th century witnessed
    profound changes in Indian society and politics due to the expansion and
    consolidation of British imperialism. Indians became aware that their
    interests were being subordinated to those of the British authority.</p>
<strong>Nineteenth-century Transformations in India: </strong>
<p>The impact of modern Western culture, coupled with the consciousness of
    defeat by a foreign power, sparked a new awakening. Modern education systems
    introduced the educated classes to ideas of equality, liberty, and
    nationalism. The educated Indians, products of modern education, started
    critically evaluating their society, aiming to restore the nation's lost
    identity.</p>
<p>This cultural shift, expressed through social and religious reforms, was
    encapsulated in the term 'Indian Renaissance.' It denoted a period of
    transitioning values, evolving social sensibilities, and a resurgence in
    cultural creativity.</p>
<p>A significant aspect of this movement was the examination of the past and an
    evaluation of traditions to address contemporary challenges. Figures like
    Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Narayana Guru aimed to
    eradicate social obscurantism, religious superstitions, and irrational
    rituals. Their common goal was the transformation of existing social and
    cultural conditions, especially concerning irrational religious practices
    and the plight of women.</p>
<p>The Renaissance aimed to 'purify' and 'rediscover' an Indian civilization
    aligned with European ideals of rationalism, empiricism, monotheism, and
    individualism. It sought to demonstrate that Indian civilization was not
    inferior to the West and, in certain spiritual aspects, even superior.</p>
<p>Evidence of this quest for a superior national culture was evident in the
    rise of patriotic regional literature, the emergence of new art forms, the
    pursuit of purer classical music, and the construction of new ideals of
    womanhood. Literary figures such as Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Tagore,
    Iqbal, and Subramaniya Bharati provided leadership with imagination and
    fervor.</p>
<p>The movement not only emphasized beauty and nationalism but also presented
    India in terms of its spirit, philosophy, arts, poetry, music, and diverse
    ways of life. The pride in the spiritual essence of Indian civilization, in
    contrast to the material culture of the West, motivated Indians to confront
    the colonial state in an emerging public space. This laid the ideological
    foundation for modern Indian nationalism in the late 19th century.</p>"
"Q4: Many voices had strengthened and enriched the nationalist movement during the Gandhian Phase. Elaborate. 
Ans: Gandhian Phase in Indian freedom struggle is undoubtedly remarkable because of the perspective Gandhiji provided to the masses and the way he guided the freedom fighters with the means of truth and non-violence. But there were numerous other simultaneous factors which further strengthened Gandhi’s efforts and contributed to the nationalist movement. Voices which strengthened and enriched the nationalist movement: Khilafat Movement (1919-22) was launched by the Indian Muslims to pressurise the British government to preserve the authority of Ottoman Sultan as Caliph of Islam. Gandhi and Congress leaders viewed it as an opportunity for cementing Hindu-Muslim unity and bringing the Muslims in the National Movement although this event is said to have brought the issue of religion in the freedom struggle. The ideological differences between the Swarajists and the No-Changers within the congress led to serious changes and contribution. No-changers continued their constructive programme of spinning, temperance, Hindu-Muslim unity, removal of untouchability etc whereas Swarajists won the election of Central Legislative Assembly in november 1923 filling the political void while the national movement was regaining its strength. Marxism and other socialist ideas spread rapidly in 1927 under J.L. Nehru and S.C. Bose’s leadership. The left wing did not confine its concern to freedom struggle only but raised the question of internal class oppression by the capitalists and landlords. It strengthened the voices of the marginalised and poor of the country and connected them to the movements. Revolutionaries like R.P. Bismil, C.S. Azad and Bhagat Singh among others took the responsibilities of informing people about a necessary revolution to uproot British Empire. The Terrorist Movement in Bengal led by Surya Sen is notable because of the role of revolutionary women who participated. Students and peasant parties got involved and propagated Marxist and communist ideas while remaining an integral part of the national movement and the Congress. In 1928, Bardoli Satyagraha occurred under the leadership of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel bringing forward farmers’ concerns. There was rapid growth of trade unionism under the leadership of All India Trade Union Congress and many strikes took place during 1928 like Kharagpur, Jamshedpur and Bombay Textile Mill strike is the most important. The traders and workers contributed to the struggle for independence. Women from all over India were not left alone. They came forward and equally contributed to the national movement. Kasturba Gandhi, VIjay Laxmi Pandit, Aruna Asaf Ali, Bhikaji Cama are some of the most prominent who assumed leadership at different fronts. Even the Business class participated by giving financial assistance and rejecting imported goods Every class, section, age group, political ideology emerged, came forward and contributed to the national movement. Even though it weakened the movement to some extent by the fragmentation and the internal ideological differences, it mainly made the movement strong by diversifying it and adding alternative perspectives to it. This multidimensional nature of the movement is one of the reasons for its success in 1947 when finally all the unheard voices till then were heard.",Paraphrase the above text but don't change the basic sense of the passage and don't make the language complicated.

    the freedom struggle.Ideological Differences within Congress: The
    ideological rift between the Swarajists and No-Changers within Congress
    brought about significant contributions. No-changers focused on constructive
    programs like spinning, temperance, Hindu-Muslim unity, and untouchability
    removal. Meanwhile, Swarajists won the 1923 Central Legislative Assembly
    elections, filling a political void during the national movement's
    resurgence.Spread of Marxist and Socialist Ideas: Under the leadership of
    J.L. Nehru and S.C. Bose in 1927, Marxism and socialist ideas addressed
    issues beyond the freedom struggle, emphasizing internal class oppression by
    capitalists and landlords. This strengthened the voices of the marginalized
    and poor, connecting them to broader movements.Role of Revolutionaries:

    significant contributions to the independence struggle.Women's
    Participation: Women from across India, including Kasturba Gandhi, Vijay
    Laxmi Pandit, Aruna Asaf Ali, and Bhikaji Cama, emerged as prominent leaders
    in different facets of the national movement.Business Class Participation:

"Q5: Assess the role of British imperial power in complicating the process of transfer of power during the 1940s.
Ans:Introduction Britain never wanted to leave India but the promise to the Indian National Congress of independence in return of Indian resources and army during World War Two; the post war financial and political exhaustion; change in political power at the centre (Labour Party) whose ideology favoured the Congress party; increasing global pressure and the inability to crush Indian leaders’ will and efforts finally led to the Indian independence. However, Britain did succeed in making the process of transfer of power so complicated and hard that India still suffers from them. Cabinet Mission Sir Stafford Cripps was responsible for drafting the Cabinet Mission Plan, which proposed a complicated system for India with three tiers- the provinces, provincial groupings and the centre. The centre’s power was confined to foreign affairs, defence, currency and communication only. Three major groups of provinces: Group A, to include the Hindu-majority provinces; Group B, containing the Muslim-majority provinces (western Pakistan); and Group C, to include the Muslim-majority Bengal (eastern Pakistan). Even though both Nehru and Jinnah eventually refused to accept it, Lord Wavell authorised a cabinet with Nehru as the Interim Prime Minister which enraged Jinnah who in turn resorted to direct action of sparking riots and massacres. Partition In July, 1947 the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act which provided for the demarcation of India and Pakistan by midnight of August 14–15, 1947, in just one month. Two Nations Theory was an important factor here and fuelled communalism. The task of demarcating the boundaries was given to a British lawyer, Sir Cyril Radcliffe who had never visited the country before and was clueless about the social and political consequences of his decision. Two boundary commissions were set up for it. During partition, there was a large-scale communal violence and forced migration of people, probably the biggest in history. Autonomy to Princely States The British paramountcy on the princely states and all the existing treaties of Britain with the princely states before the independence ended in 1947. As princely states were not a part of the British India, they became independent and had the option to either merge with India or with Pakistan or to stay independent. Even after the efforts of Lord Mountbatten, Nehru and Patel, few princely states like Kashmir, Junagadh and Hyderabad posed some serious challenges in the already troubled times. Conclusion It was hard to let go of the main resource supplier and the market consumer but when the odds were not in favour of Britain, it gave independence to India but made sure to create some contentious issues while leaving India. A lot of current day problems like issue of enclaves with Bangladesh (later resolved through The Constitution 100th Amendment Act, 2015), the migration issue, Kashmir issue between India-Pakistan etc. have their roots in the complications created by the British imperial power during the 1940s.",Paraphrase the above text but don't change the basic sense of the passage and don't make the language complicated.

"How Indians Named India
The Rig Veda is India's most ancient
text; as we will see in Chapter 7,
it is several thousand years old.
It gives the northwest region of
the Subcontinent the name 'Sapta
Sindhava', that is, the 'land of the
seven rivers'. The word 'Sindhava'
comes from 'Sindhu', which refers
to the Indus River, or at times to a
river in general.

Moving on in time, we see names for other parts of India
appear in the literature. The Mahäbhärata is one of India's
most famous texts (we read about it in the theme 'Our
Cultural Heritage and Knowledge Traditions'). Interestingly,
it lists many regions, such as Käshmira (more or less today's
Kashmir), Kurukshetra (parts of Haryana today), Vanga
(parts of Bengal), Prägjyotisha (roughly today's Assam),
Kaccha (today's Kutch), Kerala (more or less today's Kerala),
and so on.

But when do we come across a name for the entire Indian
Subcontinent? Because ancient Indian texts are difficult to
date, this is not an easy question to answer. The Mahäbhärata
uses the terms 'Bhäratavarsha' and 'Jambudvipa', and
scholars generally agree that this long poem was written
from a few centuries BCE onward.
The first term, 'Bhäratavarsha', clearly extends to the entire
Subcontinent, and the text includes the names of numerous
rivers and peoples. 'Bhäratavarsha' means 'the country of
the Bharatas'. 'Bharata' is a name that first appears in the
Rig Veda, where it refers to one of the main Vedic groups
of people. In later literature, several kings named 'Bharata'
are mentioned.

The second term, 'Jambudvipa', means 'the island of the
fruit of the jamun tree'. This is indeed a common tree native
to India, also called 'jambul tree', 'Malabar plum tree', etc.
'Jambudvipa' came to mean the Indian Subcontinent.
In fact, we get a good clue from an Indian emperor — his
name is Aéhoka and we will meet him later; for now, we
can take his date to be about 250 BCE. As we will see, he
left us many inscriptions. In one of them, he used the same name 'Jambudvipa' to describe the whole of India, which
at the time included what is today Bangladesh, Pakistan, as
well as parts of Afghanistan.
A few centuries later, 'Bhärata' became the name generally
used for the Indian Subcontinent. For instance, in an ancient
text called the Vishnu Purana, we read:
This name, 'Bhärata' remains in use even today. In north
India, it is generally written as 'Bharat', while in south
India, it is often 'Bharatam'.
It is interesting to note that different parts of the country
adopted a similar definition for India. For instance, a poem
of ancient Tamil literature, from about 2,000 years ago,
praises a king whose name is known ""from [Cape] Kumari
in the south, from the great mountain in the north, from
the oceans on the east and on the west..."" You can now
recognise 'the great mountain in the north', and it should
not be difficult to identify 'Cape Kumari'. It looks like ancient
Indians knew their geography well!","Paraphrase with headings. Use easy Language according to class 6 students. Do not Short any informations

<h3>Emperor Ashoka and the Name 'Jambudvipa'</h3>
<ul>A big clue about the use of 'Jambudvipa' comes from Emperor Ashoka, who
    ruled around 250 BCE. Ashoka left many inscriptions, and in one of them, he
    used 'Jambudvipa' to describe the whole of India. During his time, this
    included areas that are now Bangladesh, Pakistan, and parts of Afghanistan.

<ul>A few centuries later, 'Bhärata' became the widely used name for the Indian
    Subcontinent. For example, in an ancient text called the Vishnu Purana, the
    name 'Bhärata' is used to describe the region. This name is still in use
    today. In North India, it is generally written as 'Bharat,' while in South
    India, it is often 'Bharatam.'</ul><strong>, 'Bhärata' </strong>
<h3>Ancient Tamil Literature and the Idea of India</h3>
<ul>Interestingly, different parts of ancient India shared a similar
    understanding of the country's geography. For example, a poem from ancient
    Tamil literature, about 2,000 years old, praises a king whose fame spread
    ""from [Cape] Kumari in the south, from the great mountain in the north, from
    the oceans on the east and on the west..."" This shows that ancient Indians
    knew their geography well and had a clear idea of the land that made up
    India.</ul><strong>For example, </strong>"

    country as both 'India' and 'Bharat'.</p><strong>""Bhärat arthäth

"How Foreigners Named India
The first foreigners to mention India were the Persians,
the ancient inhabitants of Iran. In the 6th century BCE, a
Persian emperor launched a military campaign and gained
control of the region of the Indus River, which, as we saw,
was earlier called 'Sindhu'. So, it is no surprise that in their
earliest records and stone inscriptions, the Persians referred
to India as 'Hind', 'Hidu' or 'Hindu', which are adaptations
in their language of 'Sindhu'. (Note that in ancient Persian,
'Hindu' is a purely geographical term; it does not refer here
to the Hindu religion.)
Based on these Persian sources, the ancient Greeks named
the region 'Indoi' or 'Indike'. They dropped the initial letter
'h' of 'Hindu' because this letter did not exist in their Greek
language.
The ancient Chinese also interacted with India. In several
texts, they refer to India as 'Yintu' or 'Yindu'. This word also
originally comes from 'Sindhu', in the following manner:
Another Chinese word, also derived from
'Sindhu', was 'Tianzhu'; but this word could
also be understood as 'heavenly master'. This
reflects the respect the ancient Chinese had
for India as the land of the Buddha.
You are probably quite familiar with a
more recent term, 'Hindustan', but you may
not know that it was first used in a Persian
inscription some 1,800 years ago! Later on, this became
the term used by most invaders of India to describe the
Indian Subcontinent.","Paraphrase with heading and sub headings

"How Is Time Measured in History?
Can you identify which calendar is most widely used around the world today?
Yes, the Gregorian calendar is the most widely used around the world today. It is commonly used for
civil purposes, while other calendars, such as the Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, and Chinese calendars, are
often used for religious festivals and special occasions.
Each society and culture has had its own ways ofmeasuring
time. Major events, such as the birth of an important
person or the start of a ruler's reign, have often marked
the beginning of a new era. At present, the Gregorian calendar is commonly used worldwide; side by side, Hindu,
Muslim, Jewish, Chinese and other calendars are also used
for calculating the dates of festivals and other auspicious
events.
In the West, the conventional year for Jesus Christ's birth
has generally been taken to be the starting point for this
calendar. Years are counted forward from this point and
used to be marked with 'AD' (an abbreviation for a Latin
phrase that refers to the years after Jesus' birth). However,
this is now called the Common Era or CE across the world.
For example, 1947, the year India gained independence,
can be written as 1947 AD (sometimes AD 1947) or 1947 CE.
Similarly, the years before the conventional date for the
birth of Jesus are counted backward and used to be
marked with BC (or Before Christ). They are now called
Before Common Era or BCE. For example, 560 BCE is an
approximate year of birth of Gautama Buddha.","Paraphrase in very simple language according to class 6 students.

"The Beginnings of Human History
Can you name one way early humans made their lives easier?
Yes, early humans made their lives easier by using tools like stone axes and arrowheads, which
helped them hunt, build, and protect themselves.
Modern humans (Homo sapiens) have walked the planet
for about 300,000 (three lakh) years. This appears to be a
very long time, yet it is only a tiny fraction of the Earth's
history. Let us have a quick look at our early history.
Early humans faced many challenges from nature and lived
in bands or groups to help each other. They were constantly
seeking shelter and food, and were mainly hunters and
gatherers; this means that they relied on hunting and
collecting edible plants and fruits for their survival. Our
early ancestors also had certain beliefs about the natural
elements and possibly also some notion of afterlife.
These groups lived in temporary camps, rock shelters or
caves, and communicated with each other using languages
that are now lost. They used fire and started making obj ects
that made their lives easier, like improved stone axes and
blades, arrowheads and other tools. Aspects of their life
are visible in rock paintings found in hundreds of caves
all over the world. Some of those paintings depict simple
figures or a few symbols; others are more detailed and
represent scenes with animals or humans. In time, these
early humans learned to make simple ornaments such as
stone or shell beads, pendants made of animal teeth, and
sometimes exchanged them with other groups.",Paraphrase in very simple language according to class 6 students.,"<h2>The Beginnings of Human History</h2>

"The First Crops
Over long ages, the Earth's climate has gone through many
changes. At certain times, it was very cold and much of the
Earth was covered with ice — this is called an 'Ice Age', as
you will learn in greater detail in Science. Later, when the
climate warmed up, this ice partly melted, and the resulting
waters swelled the existing rivers and eventually drained
into the oceans. The last Ice Age lasted from over 100,000
(one lakh) years ago to around 12,000 years ago.
Afterwards, living conditions improved for humans; in many
parts of the world, they started settling down and cultivating
cereals and grains. They also domesticated animals such as
cattle, goats, etc. With more food available, these communities
grew in size and number, and often settled down near rivers.
This was not only because of the availability of water, but
also because the soil would be more fertile there. It made the
